The contract above may have the following vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state, but it does not enforce a consistent state across all functions.
   
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the functions in the contract have the correct visibility and ownership restrictions in place.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function checks for a condition that involves reading the balance of the contract, which may consume more gas than expected and cause the function to fail.

Thus, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
