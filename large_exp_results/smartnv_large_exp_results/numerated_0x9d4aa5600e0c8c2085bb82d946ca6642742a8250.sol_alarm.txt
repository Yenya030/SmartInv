The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The 'endExecute' function updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without considering potential side effects or dependencies on other parts of the contract. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract does not specify explicit visibility modifiers for its functions and variables. This can lead to potential issues regarding access control and visibility.

3) Ether leakage:
- The contract does not implement any mechanism to handle incoming Ether, which can result in Ether being trapped in the contract without any way to withdraw it.

4) Additionally, it is worth noting that the 'proposal' struct is being used without being initialized, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership 
3) Ether leakage
