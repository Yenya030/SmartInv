The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;

    enum State {AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE}
    State public currentState;

    modifier onlyBuyer() {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can call this function");
        _;
    }

    modifier onlySeller() {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can call this function");
        _;
    }

    modifier inState(State expectedState) {
        require(currentState == expectedState, "Invalid state for this operation");
        _;
    }

    constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter) {
        buyer = msg.sender;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        currentState = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;
    }

    function deposit() public payable onlyBuyer inState(State.AWAITING_PAYMENT) {
        currentState = State.AWAITING_DELIVERY;
    }

    function confirmDelivery() public onlyBuyer inState(State.AWAITING_DELIVERY) {
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
        payable(seller).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function refund() public onlySeller inState(State.AWAITING_DELIVERY) {
        currentState = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;
        payable(buyer).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `currentState` variable is public, which exposes the current state of the contract to all external parties. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract state.
- Insufficient gas: The `refund` function transfers the contract balance to the buyer using `payable(buyer).transfer(address(this).balance)`. If the buyer is a smart contract with limited gas, the transfer may fail due to insufficient gas and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
