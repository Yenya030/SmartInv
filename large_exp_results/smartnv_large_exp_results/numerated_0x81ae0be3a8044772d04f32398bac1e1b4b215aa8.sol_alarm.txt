Potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Privilege escalation: The deposit function allows any address to specify the payee, which can potentially lead to privilege escalation if an unauthorized address is set as the payee.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the deposit function, the payee and amount are updated without any checks or validations, which can lead to inconsistent state if the conditions are not properly enforced.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The payer and payee variables are declared as public, which can expose sensitive information about the parties involved in the escrow contract.
4) Insufficient gas: The withdraw function relies on the transfer function, which has a limited gas stipend and can potentially fail if the payee's fallback function consumes too much gas.
