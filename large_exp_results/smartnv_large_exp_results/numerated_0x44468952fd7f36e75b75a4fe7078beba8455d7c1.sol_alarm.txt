    function vote(uint _numVotes) external {
        require(_numVotes > 0, "Number of votes must be greater than 0");
        voteRecord[msg.sender] += _numVotes;
        totalVotes += _numVotes;
    }

    function revokeVote(uint _numVotes) external {
        require(_numVotes > 0, "Number of votes to revoke must be greater than 0");
        require(voteRecord[msg.sender] >= _numVotes, "Not enough votes to revoke");
        voteRecord[msg.sender] -= _numVotes;
        totalVotes -= _numVotes;
    }
}
