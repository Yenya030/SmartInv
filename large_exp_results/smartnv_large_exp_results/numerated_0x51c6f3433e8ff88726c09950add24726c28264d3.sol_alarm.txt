Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide any implementation for its functions, which could lead to incorrect behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, but it does not properly handle reentrancy, which could result in inconsistent state updates.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculation of startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; as the startingBlance is not checked for possibility of overflow.
4) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() includes a check that requires gas to be available for the transaction to complete successfully, which could lead to transactions failing due to insufficient gas.
