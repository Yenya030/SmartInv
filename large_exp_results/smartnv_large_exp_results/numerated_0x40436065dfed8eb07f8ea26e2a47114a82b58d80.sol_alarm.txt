The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The variables `lockedFunds` and `startingBalanceList` are used without being defined in the contract, which can lead to incorrect visibility issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of functions, especially in `endExecute` where the gas requirement is not clearly specified, which can lead to insufficient gas issues.
