The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions `liquidate` and `calculatePrice` are marked as public, which may expose sensitive functionality to external actors.
- Insufficient gas: The `liquidate` function may require more gas than what is provided by the caller, leading to potential failure in transaction execution.
