Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation - There is no check for unique identifiers for proposals, which could lead to confusion or manipulation.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is marked as internal, which could lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.
3) Atomicity violation - The execute function does not perform the token transfer and increase in votedAmount in an atomic manner, leaving room for inconsistencies.
4) Inconsistent state update - The endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable based on a condition that might not be directly related to the funds being locked, leading to potential inconsistencies.
5) Insufficient gas - The execute function might require more gas than available in certain scenarios, potentially leading to transaction failures.
