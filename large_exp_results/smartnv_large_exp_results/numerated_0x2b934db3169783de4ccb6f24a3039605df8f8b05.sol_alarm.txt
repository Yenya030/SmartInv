The contract to analyze:

contract TokenSale {
     IERC20 public token;
     address public owner;
     uint public price;

     constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
          token = IERC20(_token);
          owner = msg.sender;
          price = _price;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
          uint totalCost = amount * price;
          token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalCost);
          token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function buyTokens updates the state (transferring tokens) before performing the necessary checks or calculations, which may lead to inconsistent state.
2) Integer overflow: The multiplication in calculating the totalCost may result in an integer overflow if the amount is large enough, leading to unexpected behavior.
