The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function without any synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined with a visibility specifier which could lead to incorrect visibility.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
