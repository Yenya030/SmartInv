The contract you provided has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the proposal state without ensuring that only the contract owner can do so, potentially allowing unauthorized users to manipulate the proposal state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal` instead of `private`, which exposes ownership information to external contracts and may lead to privilege escalation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
