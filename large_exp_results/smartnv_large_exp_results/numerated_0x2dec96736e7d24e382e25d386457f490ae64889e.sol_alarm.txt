The contract provided for analysis:
```
contract ExampleContract {
     IERC20 public token;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     function deposit(uint amount) public {
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
         balances[msg.sender] += amount;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
     }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility - The `balances` mapping is public, which allows anyone to view the balances of all addresses. This may not be intended in a real-world scenario.
2) Insufficient gas - If the `withdraw` function is called with a large amount, it may run out of gas during execution, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Integer overflow/underflow - There is no check for integer overflow or underflow in the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the amounts exceed the limits of uint variables.
