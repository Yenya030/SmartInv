The contract provided for analysis:

contract MyContract {
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function mint(uint amount) public {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Integer Overflow/Underflow: The totalSupply variable is being incremented in the mint function without any check for potential overflow.
- Inconsistent State Update: The balances mapping is being updated in the mint and transfer functions without proper validation or check for consistency.
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The totalSupply and balances variables are public, which can expose sensitive information and potentially lead to unauthorized modifications.
- Insufficient Gas: The contract does not check for gas limits in any of the functions, which could lead to out-of-gas errors in case of complex operations.
