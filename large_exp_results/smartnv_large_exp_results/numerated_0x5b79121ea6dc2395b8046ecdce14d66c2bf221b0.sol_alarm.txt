Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not provide any implementation for its functions. This can lead to incorrect visibility and ownership concerns.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount field of the Proposal struct directly, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are processed simultaneously.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply, which may require a large amount of gas to complete and could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
