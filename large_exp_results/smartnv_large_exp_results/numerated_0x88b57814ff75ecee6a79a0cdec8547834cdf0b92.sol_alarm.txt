The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variables proposal and startingBalanceList without proper synchronization or atomicity, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may require a significant amount of gas to check if the execution has failed, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors and contract failures.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not contain the necessary functions specified by the interface, indicating a possible incorrect visibility or ownership issue.
