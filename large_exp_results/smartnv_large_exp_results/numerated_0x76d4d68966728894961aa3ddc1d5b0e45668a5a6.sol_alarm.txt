Contract being analyzed: 

contract Vault {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
- Integer Overflow/Underflow: vulnerability could occur in the `deposit()` function if the `balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;` operation results in an overflow situation.
- Insufficient Gas: if the `withdraw()` function requires a large amount of gas to process, it could be susceptible to running out of gas and failing midway, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
- Ether Leakage: in the `withdraw()` function, if an external call fails after `msg.sender.transfer(amount);` but before `balances[msg.sender] -= amount;`, it could result in funds being stuck in the contract.
