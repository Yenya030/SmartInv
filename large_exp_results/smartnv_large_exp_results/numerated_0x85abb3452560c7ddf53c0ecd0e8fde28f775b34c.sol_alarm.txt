The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function might run out of gas during execution due to potential token transfer operations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, leaving it susceptible to potential access control issues.
