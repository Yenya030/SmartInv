The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state without checking if there is an existing proposal already.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may expose it to potential unauthorized access or manipulation.
