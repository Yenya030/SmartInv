Contract to be analyzed:
contract Voting {
     uint256 public totalVotes;
     mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

     function vote() public {
            require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "you have already voted");
            totalVotes += 1;
            hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
      }
} 

Potential vulnerabilities:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Inconsistent state update
