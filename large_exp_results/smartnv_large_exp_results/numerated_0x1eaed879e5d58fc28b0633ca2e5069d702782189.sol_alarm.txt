Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" variable is being updated in the "execute" function without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Business logic flaw: The condition "execution has ended" in the "execute" function relies solely on block timestamps, which can be manipulated by miners to exploit the execution window.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable is not specified with a visibility modifier, potentially leading to issues with contract ownership or access control.

Overall assessment: The contract contains vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, business logic flaws, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
