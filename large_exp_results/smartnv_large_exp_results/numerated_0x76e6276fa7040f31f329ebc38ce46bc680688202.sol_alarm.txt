Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly in the `execute` function, which could lead to inconsistent state if there are multiple transactions trying to update it simultaneously.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier, which could lead to potential conflicts if multiple proposals are created at the same time or with the same parameters.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined with a visibility specifier, which could lead to potential visibility issues or lack of access control.
4) Insufficient gas: If the contract does not have enough gas to execute all the required operations, it could result in transaction failures or partial execution of functions.
