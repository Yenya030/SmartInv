Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the proposal's votedAmount without properly handling synchronization or concurrency issues, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables owner, votingToken, and startingBalanceList are marked as internal or not specified, which could lead to incorrect visibility or access control vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
