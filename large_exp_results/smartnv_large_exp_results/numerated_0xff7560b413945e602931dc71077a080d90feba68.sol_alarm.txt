Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without properly initializing all the variables, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not properly define all the required functions, potentially leading to ownership and visibility issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may run out of gas due to the heavy computation required for the execution validation, which could result in failed transactions.
