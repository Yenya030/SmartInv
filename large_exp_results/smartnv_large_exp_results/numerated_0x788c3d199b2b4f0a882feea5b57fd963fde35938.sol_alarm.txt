The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables 'lockedFunds', 'proposal.votedAmount', 'startingBlance', and 'startingBalanceList' are updated without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the 'owner' state variable, which could lead to issues related to contract ownership.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of input validation and boundary checks in the 'execute' function, which may lead to integer overflow if the 'amount' input is large.

4) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may fail if the gas limit is not sufficient to execute the required operations, which could result in partial execution or contract failure.
