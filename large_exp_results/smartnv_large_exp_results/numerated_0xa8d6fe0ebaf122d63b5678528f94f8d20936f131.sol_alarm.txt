The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the state variable `lockedFunds` based on the balance of `votingToken` held by the contract, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define the required functions, which could lead to functionality issues or incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
