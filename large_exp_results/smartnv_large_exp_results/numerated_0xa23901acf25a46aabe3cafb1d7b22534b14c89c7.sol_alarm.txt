The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct by += operator, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the `votedAmount` simultaneously.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` relies on external call to `votingToken.balanceOf`, but if this call consumes too much gas or the gas limit is reached, the execution of the function can fail.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` struct or the `lockedFunds` variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Also, the contract does not specify any access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions only to authorized users.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Insufficient gas
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
