The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSwap {
    uint public tokenPrice;
    IERC20 public token1;
    IERC20 public token2;

    constructor(address _token1, address _token2, uint _price) {
        token1 = IERC20(_token1);
        token2 = IERC20(_token2);
        tokenPrice = _price;
    }

    function swapTokens(uint amount) external {
        uint cost = amount * tokenPrice;
        require(token1.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        require(token2.balanceOf(address(this)) >= cost, "Contract does not have enough tokens");

        token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        token2.transfer(msg.sender, cost);
    }
}

Output: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The constructor is missing the visibility specifier, which could potentially leave the contract vulnerable to being accessed by unintended parties or contracts.
2) Arithmetic flaw - The calculation of `cost` in the `swapTokens` function could potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow if the `amount` is large and the `tokenPrice` is very small.
3) Insufficient gas - The swapTokens function might require a high gas cost for larger token amounts, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors for users trying to swap tokens.
