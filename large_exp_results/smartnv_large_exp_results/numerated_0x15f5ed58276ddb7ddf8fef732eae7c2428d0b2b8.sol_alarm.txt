The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without proper checks and could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() are marked as external, but they manipulate internal state variables like proposal and startingBalanceList. It would be more appropriate to use internal or public visibility for these functions.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks the balance of the contract and total token supply, which may consume a significant amount of gas. This could potentially lead to Out of Gas errors if the contract balance or token supply is too high.

4) Atomicity violation: The function execute() transfers tokens from the proposal.addr to the contract address and increments the votedAmount without using proper atomicity checks. This could potentially lead to race condition vulnerabilities.

5) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to verify the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could result in conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals share the same ID.

6) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve adding or subtracting amounts. If not properly checked, these operations could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

7) Business logic flaw: Depending on the specific requirements of the contract, there may be potential business logic flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors. It is important to thoroughly review the logic of the contract to identify any such vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract may require further review and potentially additional security measures to address these vulnerabilities.
