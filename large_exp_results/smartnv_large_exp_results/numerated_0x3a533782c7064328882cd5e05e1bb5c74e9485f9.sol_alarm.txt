The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from starting, executing, or ending proposals.

2) inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that the state update is consistent with the business logic.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which can lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts.
