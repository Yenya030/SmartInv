Contract to be analyzed:

contract TokenSwap {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function swapTokens(address token1, address token2, uint amount1, uint amount2) external {
        require(balances[token1] >= amount1, "Insufficient balance for token1");
        require(balances[token2] >= amount2, "Insufficient balance for token2");

        balances[token1] -= amount1;
        balances[token2] += amount1;

        balances[token2] -= amount2;
        balances[token1] += amount2;
    }
}

Output: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Arithmetic flaw
