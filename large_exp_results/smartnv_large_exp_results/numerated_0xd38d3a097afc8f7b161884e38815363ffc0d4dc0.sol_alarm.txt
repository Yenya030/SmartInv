This contract may have potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function does not reset the `proposal` variable after the execution, which could lead to inconsistent state if a new proposal is created without properly resetting the old one.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which could potentially allow unauthorized access or manipulation if not properly controlled.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, the operations in this contract could potentially run out of gas, causing transactions to fail prematurely.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposals or to prevent duplicate proposals from being created.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and ID uniqueness violation.
