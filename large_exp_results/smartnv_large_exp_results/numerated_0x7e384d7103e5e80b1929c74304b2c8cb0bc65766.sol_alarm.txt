Contract to analyze: 

contract SmartContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the SmartContract contract:
1) integer overflow/underflow: There is potential for integer underflow in the withdraw function if the amount withdrawn exceeds the current balance of the user.
2) inconsistent state update: There is potential for inconsistent state update if the balance and totalSupply are not updated atomically, leading to incorrect state.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public, which may expose sensitive information about the owner.
4) insufficient gas: If the gas provided in a transaction for deposit or withdraw is not sufficient, the transactions may revert due to running out of gas.
