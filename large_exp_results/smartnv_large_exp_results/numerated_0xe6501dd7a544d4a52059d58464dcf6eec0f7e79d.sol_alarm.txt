The contract:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling certain functions or accessing sensitive data.
2) Inconsistent state update: There might be inconsistencies in the state of the contract due to improper handling of state changes in different functions.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables within the contract might not be properly defined, leading to potential security risks.
4) Business logic flaw: There might be flaws in the logic of the contract that could be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the behavior of the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
