Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state variable without any checks, potentially allowing for unexpected state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not properly encapsulated in this contract, potentially leading to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposal data.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` may run out of gas if the loop in the `require` statement executes too many times, leading to a potential failure to execute the desired logic.
