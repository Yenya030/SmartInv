Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
6) Cross bridge inconsistency - The contract does not handle any inconsistency that might arise between different tokens or pairs it interacts with.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, which could lead to potential security issues.
