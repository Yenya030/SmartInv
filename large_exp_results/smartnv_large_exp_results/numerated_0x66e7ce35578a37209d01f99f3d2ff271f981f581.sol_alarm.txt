The contract you provided is susceptible to potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state but does not check if there is an existing proposal already in progress. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not define the required functions from the interface. This could lead to incorrect visibility and ownership of the contract.

3) Atomicity violation: The execute() function makes multiple state changes without ensuring atomicity, which could result in inconsistent or unexpected outcomes.

4) Integer overflow: The endExecute() function calculates the total balance and checks if it is greater than twice the total supply, which could potentially result in an integer overflow if the values are large.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions properly, which could lead to potential ether leakage vulnerabilities.

6) Insufficient gas: The execute() function transfers tokens without ensuring that there is enough gas to complete the transaction, potentially leading to failed transactions.

7) Business logic flaw: The liquidate() function in the contract ExchangeTokens may have a business logic flaw as it directly compares the product of getPrice(), cAmount, and 80 to dAmount, which may not accurately represent the intended liquidation conditions.
