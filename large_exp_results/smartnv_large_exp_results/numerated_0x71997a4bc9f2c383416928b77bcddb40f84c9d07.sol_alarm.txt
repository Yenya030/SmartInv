Contract Analysis:

The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract SafeTokenExchange {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    constructor(address _tokenA, address _tokenB) {
        tokenA = IERC20(_tokenA);
        tokenB = IERC20(_tokenB);
    }

    function exchangeTokens(uint amountA) public {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountA, "Insufficient balance of tokenA");
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        uint amountB = calculateAmountB(amountA);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
    }

    function calculateAmountB(uint amountA) internal returns (uint) {
        return amountA * 2; // Simple 2x conversion rate
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Arithmetic flaw: The `calculateAmountB` function does a simple multiplication to calculate the amount of tokenB to be transferred, which can lead to arithmetic flaws if the calculation results in an integer overflow.
2) Incorrect visibility: The `calculateAmountB` function is marked as `internal` which means it can be accessed by inheriting contracts, potentially leading to privilege escalation if not intended.
3) Insufficient gas: If the `exchangeTokens` function requires a large amount of gas to execute, there might be a risk of running out of gas and the transaction failing midway.

Output:
Arithmetic flaw, Incorrect visibility, Insufficient gas
