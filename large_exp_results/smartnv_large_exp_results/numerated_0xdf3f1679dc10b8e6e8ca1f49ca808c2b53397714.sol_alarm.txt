The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the code but not provided in the contract, which might indicate an incorrect visibility or ownership issue.
