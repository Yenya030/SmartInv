The contract provided for analysis:

contract PaymentProcessor {
     address public admin;
     mapping(address => uint256) public payments;
     
     constructor() {
         admin = msg.sender;
     }
     
     function processPayment(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) public {
         require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can process payments");
         payments[_recipient] += _amount;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
