The vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) business logic flaw: The function endExecute in the TimelockController contract checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply of the voting token to determine if execution has failed. This logic may not be accurate in determining the success or failure of the execution. 

2) inconsistent state update: The execute function in the TimelockController contract updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct, but it does not update the votedAmount in the proposal storage variable. This can lead to an inconsistent state within the contract.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear from the provided snippets if the owner variable in the TimelockController contract is properly protected and defined with the correct visibility and ownership specifications.
