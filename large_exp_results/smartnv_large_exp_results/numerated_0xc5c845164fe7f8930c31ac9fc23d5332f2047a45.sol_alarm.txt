Contract identified vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update may occur because the state of `proposal` variables is updated in different functions without proper synchronization.
2) ID uniqueness violation might happen if there is no check to ensure unique IDs for proposals.
3) Privilege escalation is possible since the ownership of the contract is not properly managed.
4) Insufficient gas may lead to transaction failures if the gas limit is not properly set for transactions within the contract.
