Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, which may lead to an inconsistent state as it doesn't consider the possibility of external transfers affecting the balance during the execution.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is being accessed and modified outside of its scope in the functions `execute` and `endExecute`, which might lead to incorrect visibility or ownership control over the proposal data.

Overall, the contract could be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates and incorrect visibility/ownership issues.
