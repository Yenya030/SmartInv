The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how this variable is used or what impact it may have on the contract's state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `proposal` variable is not specified, which could lead to potential issues with accessing or modifying the variable. Additionally, the ownership of the contract and how it is managed is not clearly defined.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
