Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
- In the `execute` function, there is potential for integer overflow in `proposal.votedAmount += amount` if the voted amount surpasses the maximum uint256 value.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The `proposal` struct is not specified with a visibility modifier, making it public by default. This could potentially expose sensitive data.

3) Inconsistent state update: 
- In the `endExecute` function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might lead to an inconsistent state if the balance of the contract changes between the balance check and the subsequent code execution.

4) Atomicity violation:
- Operations in functions like `startExecute` and `execute` involve multiple steps where various state changes are made. However, these steps are not wrapped in a transaction, potentially leading to atomicity violations if one of the steps fails.

5) Ether leakage:
- There is no handling for the transfer of Ether in any of the functions, which could result in Ether leakage if Ether is inadvertently sent to the contract.

6) Privilege escalation:
- The access control for critical functions like `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` is not clearly defined, leaving a potential vulnerability for privilege escalation if unauthorized users can call these functions.
