Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct state variables without checking if a proposal is already ongoing, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() might require a significant amount of gas if the totalSupply of the voting token is large, potentially leading to insufficient gas error.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which might not provide the desired visibility or control over ownership depending on the contract's intended functionality.
