The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization mechanisms. This could lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The state variables votingToken and owner are declared as internal, which may expose them to unintended access or manipulation by external contracts.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
