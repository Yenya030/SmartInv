The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not clearly define access control mechanisms, allowing for potential privilege escalation by unauthorized users.
2) inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without adequate checks or validation, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate()` function may result in an arithmetic flaw if the input values are not properly validated or sanitized.
