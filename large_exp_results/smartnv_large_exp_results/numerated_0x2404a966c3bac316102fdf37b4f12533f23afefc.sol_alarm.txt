The following contract may have potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function 'endExecute()' updates the 'lockedFunds' variable based on a condition related to the balance of the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface, which may expose sensitive functions to external parties if not handled carefully.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
