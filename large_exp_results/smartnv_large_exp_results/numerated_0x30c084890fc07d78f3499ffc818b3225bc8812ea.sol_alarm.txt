Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without proper initialization or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is only marked as internal, which might not provide the intended access control protection for critical functions.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas exceptions which could lead to execution failures.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for uniqueness of `proposal.addr` before assigning it in the `startExecute()` function, which could lead to ID uniqueness violations.
