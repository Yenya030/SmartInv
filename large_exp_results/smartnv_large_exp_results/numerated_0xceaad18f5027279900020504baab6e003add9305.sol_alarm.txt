The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the 'proposal' struct is being updated directly in multiple functions without proper synchronization or control mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent or unexpected behaviors.
2) Insufficient gas: The execute function does not include a gas stipend for external calls, which may result in out-of-gas errors when interacting with external contracts.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for controlling ownership within the contract.
