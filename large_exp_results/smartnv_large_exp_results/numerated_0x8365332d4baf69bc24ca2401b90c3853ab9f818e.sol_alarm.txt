The contract provided for analysis:
```solidity
contract SecureMarket {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public prices;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setPrice(address token, uint price) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set prices");
        prices[token] = price;
    }

    function getPrice(address token) view public returns (uint) {
        return prices[token];
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The `setPrice` function only checks if the caller is the owner, but it should also restrict the access control by using the `onlyOwner` modifier.
2) Insufficient gas - Depending on the gas costs of the `setPrice` function and the price of the token, setting the price might consume more gas than the transaction limit, leading to an insufficient gas vulnerability.
