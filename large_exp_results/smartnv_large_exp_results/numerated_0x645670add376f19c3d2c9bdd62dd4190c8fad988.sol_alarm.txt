The contract to analyze:

contract VoteSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 voteCount;
        bool voted;
    }
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;

    function vote() public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted");
        voters[msg.sender].voteCount += 1;
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
    }

    function resetVotes() public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].voted, "Not voted yet");
        voters[msg.sender].voteCount = 0;
        voters[msg.sender].voted = false;
    }
}
