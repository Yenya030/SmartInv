Contract to analyze:
contract Escrow {
    address public player1;
    address public player2;
    uint public player1Deposit;
    uint public player2Deposit;
    
    constructor(address _player1, address _player2) {
        player1 = _player1;
        player2 = _player2;
    }

    function deposit(uint player) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == player1 || msg.sender == player2, "You are not part of the escrow");
        if(player == 1) {
            require(msg.value == player1Deposit, "Incorrect deposit amount for player 1");
        } else if(player == 2) {
            require(msg.value == player2Deposit, "Incorrect deposit amount for player 2");
        }
    }

    function releaseFunds(uint player) public {
        require(msg.sender == player1 || msg.sender == player2, "You are not part of the escrow");
        if(player == 1) {
            payable(player1).transfer(address(this).balance);
        } else if(player == 2) {
            payable(player2).transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
} 

Output: 
1) Insufficient gas
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
