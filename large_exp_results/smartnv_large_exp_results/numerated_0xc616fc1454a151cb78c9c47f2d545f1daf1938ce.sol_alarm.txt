Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not explicitly defined, which may lead to accessibility and security issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of certain functions, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
4) Inconsistent state update: There could be instances where the state of the contract is updated inconsistently, leading to unexpected results.
5) Business logic flaw: There may be flaws in the logic of the contract that could be exploited by malicious users.
