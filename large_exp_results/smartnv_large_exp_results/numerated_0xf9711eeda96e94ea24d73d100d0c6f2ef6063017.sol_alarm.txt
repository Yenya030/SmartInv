The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state update in the `startExecute` function where the `proposal` state variable is updated without checking if there is an existing proposal in progress. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` state variable in multiple steps without using any locking mechanism to ensure atomicity. This could create potential race conditions and result in unexpected outcomes.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility and ownership control for the `lockedFunds` state variable. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
