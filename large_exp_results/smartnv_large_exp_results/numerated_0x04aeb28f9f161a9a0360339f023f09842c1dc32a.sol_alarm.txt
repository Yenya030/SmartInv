contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) hasVoted;
    mapping(address => uint256) voteCount;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        voteCount[msg.sender]++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation - there is no mechanism to prevent multiple votes from the same address.
2) Inconsitent state update - hasVoted is updated after voteCount, which can lead to inconsistency if an error occurs after voteCount is incremented.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership - hasVoted mapping is public, which exposes voter information publicly.
