The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Privilege escalation: The `makePayment` function allows only the owner to make payments, but there is a possibility of privilege escalation if the `owner` variable is compromised.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, exposing the owner's address to the public. This can lead to potential security risks if the owner's address is exposed and targeted.
