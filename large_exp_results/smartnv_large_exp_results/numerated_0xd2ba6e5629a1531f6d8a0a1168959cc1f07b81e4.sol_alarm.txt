Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of having duplicate IDs for proposals as there is no mechanism to ensure uniqueness.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly with `+=`, which may lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are not specified with visibility (e.g., public, internal, private), which could lead to potential visibility or ownership issues.
