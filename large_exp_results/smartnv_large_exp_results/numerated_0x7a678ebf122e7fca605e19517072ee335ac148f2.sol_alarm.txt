Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to have any mechanisms for ensuring unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not explicitly defined, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by unauthorized parties.
