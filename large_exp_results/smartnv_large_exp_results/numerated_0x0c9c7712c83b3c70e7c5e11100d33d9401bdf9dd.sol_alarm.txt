The contract provided for analysis:

```
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 endTime;
        address creator;
        uint256 votes;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public totalProposals;
    
    function createProposal(uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime) public {
        totalProposals++;
        proposals[totalProposals] = Proposal(_startTime, _endTime, msg.sender, 0);
    }
    
    function vote(uint256 _proposalId) public {
        require(proposals[_proposalId].startTime < block.timestamp, "voting has not started yet");
        require(proposals[_proposalId].endTime > block.timestamp, "voting has ended");
        proposals[_proposalId].votes++;
    }
    
    function getProposalVotes(uint256 _proposalId) public view returns (uint256) {
        return proposals[_proposalId].votes;
    }
}
```

Output:  
- inconsistent state update: The `votes` of a proposal is directly incremented without checking if the user has already voted. This could lead to inconsistent voting results.  
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposals` mapping is set to public, which exposes all proposals to external entities. This could be a security risk if sensitive information is stored in the proposals.
