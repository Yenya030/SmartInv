Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without initializing it, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The updates to `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function are not done atomically, which can lead to inconsistencies in the data.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not properly handle ownership and visibility of functions and variables that should be private or internal.
