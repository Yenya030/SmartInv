Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct without initializing it first, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks for unique IDs when creating or updating proposals, which can lead to ID collisions and unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function checks for a condition that involves querying the balance of a contract, which could consume excessive gas and potentially fail.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The address owner is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for the owner of the contract.
