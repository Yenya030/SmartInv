This contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function, but there is no indication of what the purpose of this variable is or how it is used within the contract.

2) ID uniqueness violation: 
- The 'proposal' struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are created simultaneously or if there is a need to differentiate between them in any way.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The 'owner' variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the desired visibility or access control for managing ownership within the contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
