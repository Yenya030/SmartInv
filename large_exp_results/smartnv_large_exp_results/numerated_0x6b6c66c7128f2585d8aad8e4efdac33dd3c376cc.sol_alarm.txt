Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without checking for consistency, which could lead to incorrect data being stored.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs division without handling potential arithmetic overflow/underflow, which could result in unexpected outcomes.
