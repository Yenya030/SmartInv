Contract to analyze for vulnerabilities:

contract LockBox {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the LockBox contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The transferOwnership function is not restricted to only the owner, which can lead to privilege escalation.
2) Reentrancy: The withdraw function could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
3) Ether leakage: The use of the call function in the withdraw function could potentially lead to ether being trapped in the contract.
4) Insufficient gas: The deposit function does not include gas stipend for the transfer, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
