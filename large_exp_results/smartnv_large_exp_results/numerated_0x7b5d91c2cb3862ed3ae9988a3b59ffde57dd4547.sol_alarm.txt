The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes the ownership to the public and may lead to privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The totalAmount variable is directly modified without considering potential race conditions, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
