The potential vulnerabilities present in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without checking if it is appropriately calculated and updated, potentially leading to incorrect data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables WETH, USDC, and pair are declared as public, which can expose sensitive information and may not be secure.
3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, allowing for potential ether leakage or loss.
4) Price manipulation: The function calculatePrice() calculates the price without proper validation or protection, making it susceptible to price manipulation attacks.
