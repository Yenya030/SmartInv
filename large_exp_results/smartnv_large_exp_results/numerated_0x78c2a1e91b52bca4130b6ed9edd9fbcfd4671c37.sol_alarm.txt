Given the provided contract:

contract InvestmentPool {
     IERC20 public token;
     address public owner;
     uint public totalInvested;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     constructor(address _token) {
          token = IERC20(_token);
          owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function invest(uint amount) public {
          require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient token balance");
          token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
          balances[msg.sender] += amount;
          totalInvested += amount;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
          require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance to withdraw");
          balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
          totalInvested -= amount;
          token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
     }
}

Based on the contract provided, the potential vulnerabilities that may exist are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public which allows anyone to view the owner address. It is good practice to make sensitive variables like owner private.

2) Insufficient gas: If the contract accumulates a large number of investors and balances, the gas cost for executing functions like withdraw can become prohibitively expensive for users.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership and insufficient gas.
