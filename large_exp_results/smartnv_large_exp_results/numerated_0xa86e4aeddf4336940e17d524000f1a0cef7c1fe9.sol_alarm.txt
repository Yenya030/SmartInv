The contract provided is as follows:

contract VotingSystem {
     struct Voter {
          uint256 weight;
          bool voted;
          uint256 vote;
     }

     mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
     address public admin;
     uint256 public totalVotes;
     uint256 public totalVoters;
     
     constructor() {
          admin = msg.sender;
     }

     function giveRightToVote(address _voter) public {
          require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can give right to vote.");
          require(!voters[_voter].voted, "The voter has already voted.");
          require(voters[_voter].weight == 0, "The voter already has the right to vote.");
          voters[_voter].weight = 1;
          totalVoters++;
     }

     function vote(uint256 _proposal) public {
          require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "You have no right to vote.");
          require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "You have already voted.");
          voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
          voters[msg.sender].vote = _proposal;
          totalVotes++;
     }

     function winningProposal() public view returns (uint256) {
          require(totalVotes > 0, "No votes have been cast yet.");
          // logic to determine winning proposal
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
- Privilege escalation: The giveRightToVote function allows the admin to give voting rights to any address, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- Inconsistent state update: The voting logic in the vote function can lead to inconsistent state updates if proper checks are not performed.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for duplicate voters, which can lead to ID uniqueness violation.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, which can expose the contract owner's identity and potentially lead to unauthorized access.
