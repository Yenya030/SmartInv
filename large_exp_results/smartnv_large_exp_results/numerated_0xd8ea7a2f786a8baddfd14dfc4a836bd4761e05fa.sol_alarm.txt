The contract provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not define visibility for the owner variable, making it public by default. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the owner variable.

2) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply to determine if the execution was successful. This logic may be flawed as it does not consider all possible scenarios and could lead to incorrect outcomes.

3) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount variable directly without using safe arithmetic operations. This can lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract if integer overflows/underflows occur.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The execute function does not handle the possibility of integer overflows when updating the votedAmount variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior if a large amount is transferred in one transaction.

5) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas stipend in the execute function when transferring tokens, which may result in the transaction running out of gas before completing the transfer.

6) Inconsistent state update: The endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable without proper checks or validations, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior if multiple proposals are created with the same ID. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: incorrect visibility/ownership, business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas, inconsistent state update, and ID uniqueness violation.
