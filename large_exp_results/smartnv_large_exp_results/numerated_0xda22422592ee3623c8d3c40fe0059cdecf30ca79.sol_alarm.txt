The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:
contract DeFiProtocol {
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Withdrawal amount must be greater than 0");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
    }
}

Output:
- Healthy
