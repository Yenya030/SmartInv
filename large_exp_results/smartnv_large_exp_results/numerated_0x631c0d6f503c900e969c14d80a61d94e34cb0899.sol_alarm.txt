The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSwap {
         IERC20 public token1;
         IERC20 public token2;
         uint public exchangeRate;

         function swapTokens(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
             token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
             token2.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount2);
             exchangeRate = amount2 / amount1;
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract:
- Integer division (arithmetic flaw): The division operation exchangeRate = amount2 / amount1 might result in unintended behavior if amount1 is equal to 0, causing division by zero error or undesired results.
- Insufficient check for negative values in swapTokens function.
