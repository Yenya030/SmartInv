Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which means it can be accessed by other contracts in the same inheritance hierarchy. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the owner state.
