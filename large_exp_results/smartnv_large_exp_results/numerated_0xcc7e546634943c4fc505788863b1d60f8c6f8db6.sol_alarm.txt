contract PaymentContract {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentContract contract are:
13) insufficient gas - The withdraw function might fail if the gas provided by the caller is insufficient to cover the transfer amount, resulting in a failed transaction.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership - The balances mapping is public, allowing anyone to access and potentially manipulate it, which can lead to unauthorized changes in balances.
