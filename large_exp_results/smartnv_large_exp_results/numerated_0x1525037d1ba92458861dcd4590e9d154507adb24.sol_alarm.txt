Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential vulnerability in the "endExecute" function where the condition for checking the execution has failed may not correctly update the state of the contract. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like "lockedFunds" is not specified explicitly, which may lead to access control issues and potential vulnerabilities. 

3) Insufficient gas: As the contract involves transferring tokens, there could be potential vulnerabilities related to gas estimation and running out of gas during the execution of functions. 

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or addresses, which could lead to vulnerabilities related to duplicate entries or token IDs.

5) Ether leakage: There is no explicit handling of Ether in the contract, which may lead to potential vulnerabilities related to Ether leakage or unintended Ether transfers.
