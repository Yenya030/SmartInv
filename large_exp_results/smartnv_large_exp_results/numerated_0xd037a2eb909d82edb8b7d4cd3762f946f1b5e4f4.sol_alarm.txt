Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute()" updates the state variable "proposal" without initializing it first.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20, but it does not implement the required functions of the interface. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the interface functions are called externally.
