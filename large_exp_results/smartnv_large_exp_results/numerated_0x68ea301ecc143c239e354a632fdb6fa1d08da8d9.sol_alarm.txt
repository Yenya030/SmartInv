Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' state variable in the 'endExecute' function is updated without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state if multiple executions happen simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' state variable is marked as internal, which may lead to issues related to visibility and access control.
3) Insufficient gas: There may be scenarios where the contract runs out of gas during the execution of certain functions, leading to incomplete operations or unexpected behavior. 
4) Atomicity violation: In the 'execute' function, the transfer of tokens and update of 'proposal.votedAmount' are not done atomically, which could result in inconsistent state or vulnerabilities related to reentrancy.
