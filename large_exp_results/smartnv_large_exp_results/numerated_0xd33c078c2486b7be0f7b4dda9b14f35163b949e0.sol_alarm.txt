The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` without properly considering potential race conditions or reentrancy issues.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not properly encapsulated and can be accessed directly by external actors, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized state modifications. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
