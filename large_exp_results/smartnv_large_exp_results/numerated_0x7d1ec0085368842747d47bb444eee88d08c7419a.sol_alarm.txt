The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility in the variables `lockedFunds`, `startingBalanceList`, and `proposal`. 
2) Lack of access control on functions like `execute` and `endExecute`.
3) Lack of input validation for functions like `execute` and `endExecute`.
4) Use of timestamps for time-sensitive operations.
5) Possible reentrancy issue in function `endExecute`.
6) Need to enforce proper checking before updating state variables.
7) Lack of checking the return value of `votingToken.transferFrom` in function `execute`.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Privilege escalation
- Business logic flaw
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Reentrancy
