The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract allows anyone to call the `endExecute` function, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

2) inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no indication of how this variable is being used or whether it is secure to do so.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation and inconsistent state update.
