In the given contract, the potential vulnerabilities are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without first checking if the proposal has ended, potentially allowing for inconsistent state updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function for determining if a user's funds can be liquidated may lead to arithmetic flaws depending on the values of `getPrice()`, `cAmount`, and `dAmount`.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and arithmetic flaw.
