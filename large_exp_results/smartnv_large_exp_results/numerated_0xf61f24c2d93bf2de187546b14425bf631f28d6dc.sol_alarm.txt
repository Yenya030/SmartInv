As per the provided contract, here are the potential vulnerabilities identified:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the state variables `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which could lead to potential security risks.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistent state issues.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations, such as addition in `proposal.votedAmount += amount` and comparison in `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, that may be susceptible to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Integer overflow/underflow
