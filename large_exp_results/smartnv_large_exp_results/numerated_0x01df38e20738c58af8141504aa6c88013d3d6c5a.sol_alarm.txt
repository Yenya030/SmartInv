Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not properly handle privilege escalation as the `startExecute` function allows any caller to initiate a new proposal without checking for necessary permissions.
2) atomicity violation: The contract lacks atomicity in the `execute` function as the voting process is not securely handled, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state updates in the `endExecute` function, as the conditions for checking the balance and marking the execution as failed are not synchronized.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership control and visibility modifiers are not explicitly specified for the contract functions, which may lead to unauthorized access or unexpected behavior.
5) insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the contract execution due to the lack of gas optimization strategies, potentially causing the contract to get stuck.
6) ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, leaving room for potential ether leakage vulnerabilities.
