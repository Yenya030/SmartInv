The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Reentrancy: The contract has external calls to `votingToken.transferFrom` in the `execute` function and `USDC.transferFrom` and `WETH.transferFrom` in the `liquidate` function which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if not handled properly.

2) Inconsistent State Update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without properly limiting the update to one invocation. This can lead to inconsistent state and unexpected behavior.

3) Cross Bridge Inconsistency: The `liquidate` function transfers tokens between different contracts (`USDC` and `WETH`) without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistencies between the tokens' balances in different contracts.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Reentrancy, Inconsistent State Update, and Cross Bridge Inconsistency.
