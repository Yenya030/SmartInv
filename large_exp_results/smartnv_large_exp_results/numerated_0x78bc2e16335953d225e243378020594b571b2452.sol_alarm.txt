The contract below exhibits potential vulnerabilities:

<contract_to_analyze>
contract VotingSystem {
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    address public admin;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote() public {
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function updateAdmin(address _newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can update admin");
        admin = _newAdmin;
    }
}
</contract_to_analyze>

The potential vulnerabilities in the above contract are:
- privilege escalation (updateAdmin function can allow changing the admin address, which could lead to unauthorized access)
- incorrect visibility/ownership (admin variable is set to public, exposing admin address publicly)
