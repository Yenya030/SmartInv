The contract provided for analysis:

contract Insurance {
         IERC20 public token;
         mapping(address => uint) public premium;
         mapping(address => bool) public isInsured;

         function payPremium(uint amount) public {
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
             premium[msg.sender] = amount;
             isInsured[msg.sender] = true;
         }

         function claimInsurance() public {
             require(isInsured[msg.sender], "not insured");
             uint payout = premium[msg.sender] * 2;
             token.transfer(msg.sender, payout);
             isInsured[msg.sender] = false;
         }

         function cancelInsurance() public {
             require(isInsured[msg.sender], "not insured");
             token.transfer(msg.sender, premium[msg.sender]);
             isInsured[msg.sender] = false;
         }
}

Output: 
- integer overflow/underflow: The multiplication in the claimInsurance function could potentially result in an integer overflow if the premium amount is very large.
- inconsistent state update: The cancelInsurance function cancels insurance without updating the premium amount in the mapping, leading to an inconsistent state.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The premium and isInsured mappings are public, which exposes sensitive data to all users. Consider changing visibility to internal or private.
