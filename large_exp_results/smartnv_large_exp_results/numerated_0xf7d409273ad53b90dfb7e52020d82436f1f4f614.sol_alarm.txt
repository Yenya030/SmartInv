Contract to analyze:

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[recipient] += amount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities: 
- Integer overflow/underflow: The transfer function does not check for potential integer overflows or underflows when updating balances, which could result in unexpected behavior if the amount transferred is too large or negative.
- Inconsistent state update: The balances mapping is directly manipulated without proper validation or checks, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data if not handled correctly.
