Contract being analyzed:
contract Purchase {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _seller, uint _price) {
        seller = _seller;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buy() public payable {
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect amount sent");
        seller.transfer(msg.value);
        buyer = msg.sender;
    }

    function confirmTransaction() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == buyer, "You are not authorized");
        require(buyer != address(0), "Buyer has not been set yet");
        // perform transaction
    }
}
