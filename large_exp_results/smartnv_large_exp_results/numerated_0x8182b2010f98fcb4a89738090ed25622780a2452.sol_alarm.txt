The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal.votedAmount variable without any checks or restrictions, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not implement all the required functions. This could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a potentially gas-intensive operation (checking if the locked funds are greater than half of the total supply) which could lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
