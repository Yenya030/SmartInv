The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount field of the proposal struct without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not being used or modified in the contract, which may indicate incorrect visibility or unnecessary variable declaration.
