The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = IERC20(_token);
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        uint cost = amount * price;
        require(token.balanceOf(owner) >= amount, "Not enough tokens in contract");
        require(msg.value >= cost, "Insufficient payment");
        
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        owner.transfer(msg.value);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which could expose sensitive information. It's best to keep the owner variable private and provide a function to access it if needed.

2) Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function transfers tokens and ETH in the same transaction. If the gas limit is reached during execution, it might cause a failure in transferring funds or tokens.

3) Integer overflow: The calculation of cost in the buyTokens function could potentially lead to integer overflow if the amount and price values are large, resulting in unexpected behavior.

4) Inconsistent state update: There is no check to update the balance of the owner after tokens are transferred to the buyer. This could result in incorrect accounting of token balances.

5) Ether leakage: The transfer of ETH to the owner in the buyTokens function should be handled carefully to prevent ether leakage vulnerabilities.

6) Privilege escalation: Depending on the context in which this contract is used, there could be a potential privilege escalation vulnerability if the owner's permissions are not properly controlled.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are: Insufficient gas, Integer overflow, Inconsistent state update, Ether leakage, Privilege escalation.
