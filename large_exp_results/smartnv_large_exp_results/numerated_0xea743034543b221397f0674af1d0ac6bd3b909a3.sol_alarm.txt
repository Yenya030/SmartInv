The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to handle unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals have the same ID.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of data.
3) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal is updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limitations, which could result in failed transactions or incomplete operations.
5) Business logic flaw: The logic for executing proposals and ending them seems to have potential flaws that could lead to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities.
