Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or protection, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or race conditions.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple operations (transfer and state variable update) without ensuring atomicity, which could result in partial execution and unexpected behaviors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, internal, external) for the `proposal` struct, `votingToken`, `startingBalanceList`, `lockedFunds`, and other variables which may lead to incorrect accessibility or ownership concerns.
