The contract you provided might have potential vulnerabilities including:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any access control mechanism, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation.

2) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates in case of reentrancy or other concurrent calls.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may run out of gas if the loop iterating through the balanceOf function consumes too much gas, leading to potential deadlock situations.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
