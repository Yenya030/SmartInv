The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state of the proposal without properly initializing all necessary variables, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute may fail due to insufficient gas if the computation required exceeds the gas limit.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of certain variables and functions are not clearly defined, making the contract vulnerable to unauthorized access or manipulation.
