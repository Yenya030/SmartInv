The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The "proposal" struct is being updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation:
- The function "endExecute()" involves multiple state changes without using proper mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which can result in unexpected behavior if the state changes are not executed atomically.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which might lead to unintended access control issues or privilege escalation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
