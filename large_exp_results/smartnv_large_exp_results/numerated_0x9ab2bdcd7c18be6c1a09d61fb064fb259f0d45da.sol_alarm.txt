contract TokenSwap {

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function swap(address user, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[user] >= amount, "Not enough balance to swap");
        
        tokenA.transferFrom(user, address(this), amount);

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) inconsistent state update - The balances mapping is not updated after the transfer of tokens, which could lead to inconsistent state.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership - The balances mapping is public, which may expose sensitive user information.
