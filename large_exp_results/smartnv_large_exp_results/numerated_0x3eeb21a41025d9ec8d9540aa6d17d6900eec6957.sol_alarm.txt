The potential vulnerabilities in contract_3 are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The admin variable is public, which may expose sensitive information. It should be marked as private or internal.
2) ID uniqueness violation - The hasVoted mapping uses the sender's address as the key, which may lead to ID uniqueness violation if multiple users have the same address.
3) Privilege escalation - There is no check to ensure that only the admin can set the admin variable, potentially leading to privilege escalation issues.
4) Reentrancy - The vote function can be susceptible to reentrancy attacks if there are external calls made after changing the mapping value.
