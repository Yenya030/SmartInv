The contract you are going to analyze is:

contract OrderBook {
    uint256 public orderCount;
    mapping(uint256 => Order) public orders;

    struct Order {
        address maker;
        uint256 price;
        uint256 quantity;
        bool executed;
    }

    function createOrder(uint256 _price, uint256 _quantity) public {
        Order memory newOrder = Order(msg.sender, _price, _quantity, false);
        orders[orderCount] = newOrder;
        orderCount++;
    }

    function executeOrder(uint256 _orderId) public {
        Order storage order = orders[_orderId];

        require(!order.executed, "Order already executed");
        require(msg.sender == order.maker, "Unauthorized execution");

        // Execute order logic

        order.executed = true;
    }
}

There are potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
2) Business logic flaw
