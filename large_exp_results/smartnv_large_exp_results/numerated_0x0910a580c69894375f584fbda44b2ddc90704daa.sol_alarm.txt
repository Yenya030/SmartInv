Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate does not update the debt and collateral mappings after transferring funds, which may lead to inconsistent data.
- Business logic flaw: The condition for liquidation in the liquidate function might not accurately assess the user's debt and collateral, potentially allowing for incorrect liquidations. 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: Functions like liquidate and calculatePrice should potentially have restricted access levels to prevent unauthorized use.
