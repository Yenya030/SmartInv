The contract provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) privilege escalation - The contract uses a struct to store proposals, and the `startExecute()` function allows any user to initiate a new proposal, potentially escalating their privileges.
2) inconsistent state update - In the `execute()` function, the "votedAmount" in the proposal is updated directly without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) insufficient gas - It's possible that the contract might run out of gas during the execution of functions due to complex logic and multiple state changes on the blockchain.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
