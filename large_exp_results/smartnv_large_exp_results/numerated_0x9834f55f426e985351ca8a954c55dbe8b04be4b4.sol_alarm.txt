The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated without proper validation or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes without utilizing proper atomicity mechanisms, potentially allowing for race conditions or unexpected behavior.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is marked as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility level for external access to this variable.

5) Business logic flaw: The logic for checking if the execution has ended and if voting has gone through in the `execute` function may not cover all edge cases properly, leading to potential vulnerabilities in the contract's business logic.
