The contract below contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation
2) Inconsistent state update

Contract to be analyzed:
```solidity
contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[recipient] += amount;
    }
}
