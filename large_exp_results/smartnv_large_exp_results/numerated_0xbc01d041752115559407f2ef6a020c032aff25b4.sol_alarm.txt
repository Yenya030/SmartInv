The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not consider potential changes in balances due to other actions being performed on the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, private, internal) for the `lockedFunds` variable, which can lead to potential issues with access control.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple calculations involving uint variables that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow, such as in the function `liquidate()` where the price calculation is performed.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the smart contract.
