The contract is:

contract VotingSystem {
     struct Voter {
          uint256 weight;
          bool voted;
          address delegate;
          uint256 vote;
     }
     mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
     uint256 public winningProposal;
     Proposal[] public proposals;

     function giveRightToVote(address voter) public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can give right to vote");
          require(!voters[voter].voted, "The voter already voted");
          voters[voter].weight = 1;
     }

     function delegate(address to) public {
          require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "You already voted");
          require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed");
          require(voters[to].delegate != msg.sender, "Avoid circular delegation");
          voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
          voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;
     }

     function vote(uint256 proposal) public {
          Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
          require(sender.weight > 0, "Has no right to vote");
          require(!sender.voted, "Already voted");
          sender.voted = true;
          sender.vote = proposal;
          proposals[proposal].voteCount += sender.weight;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable seems to be used without being defined or initialized, which could lead to ownership issues.
2) business logic flaw: The implementation of the vote function and the delegation function may not be following the intended logic, potentially leading to business logic flaws.
3) inconsistent state update: There might be inconsistencies in updating the state of voters and proposals, leading to potential issues.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The implementation does not demonstrate uniqueness of voter IDs, potentially leading to violations.
5) atomicity violation: Operations in the contract could potentially not be atomic, leading to unexpected results.
6) privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized entities to perform crucial actions.
7) insufficient gas: The contract functionality or operations may require more gas than available, leading to incomplete execution.
8) ether leakage: There are no payment or withdrawal functionalities in the contract, but if added, there is a potential for ether leakage.
9) reentrancy: Not explicitly handled in the contract, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
