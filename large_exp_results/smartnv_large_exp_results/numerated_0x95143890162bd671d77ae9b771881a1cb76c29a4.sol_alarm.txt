Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without appropriate boundary checks or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs arithmetic operations on values without validation or boundary checks, such as multiplying by 80% without considering potential overflow or underflow scenarios.
