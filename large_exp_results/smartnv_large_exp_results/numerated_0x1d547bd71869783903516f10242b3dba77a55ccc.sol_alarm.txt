Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the proposal state without checking if the proposal already exists, potentially allowing for multiple proposals to be active simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not have the required ERC20 functions such as transfer, transferFrom, and balanceOf, which could lead to issues with compatibility and ownership.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could result in integer overflow or underflow, such as the addition of votedAmount in the execute function.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a potentially expensive operation by checking if the votingToken balance exceeds a certain threshold, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
5) Atomicity violation: The execute function transfers tokens and updates the votedAmount field without using the appropriate mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which could result in inconsistent state updates.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Insufficient gas
- Atomicity violation
