The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract at the end of execution. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if the balances change unexpectedly during the execution.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, but it seems like it should be declared as private for better encapsulation and to prevent potential unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function performs multiple operations which could result in the contract running out of gas if the gas limit is too low. This could lead to unexpected behavior or failure of the transaction.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas issues.
