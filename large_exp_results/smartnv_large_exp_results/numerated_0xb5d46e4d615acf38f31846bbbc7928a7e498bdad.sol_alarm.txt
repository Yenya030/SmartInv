Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is updated directly without using safe arithmetic operations, which may lead to inconsistent state if overflow or underflow occurs.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined as public or internal, which may lead to accessibility issues.
3) Insufficient gas: There might be potential gas limitations in functions like `endExecute`, especially when performing actions like checking balances and calculations.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There does not seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which can lead to issues in tracking and managing proposals.
5) Privilege escalation: The `proposal` struct can be modified by any caller in the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions, which can lead to unauthorized privilege escalation.
6) Atomicity violation: Multiple actions within functions like `execute` and `endExecute` are not wrapped in a single transaction, which may lead to inconsistent or incomplete state changes.
