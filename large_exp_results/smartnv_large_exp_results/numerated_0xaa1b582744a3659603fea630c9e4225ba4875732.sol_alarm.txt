The contract provided for analysis:

contract MultiSigWallet {
  address private _owner;
  uint private _transactionCount;
  mapping(uint => Transaction) private _transactions;

  struct Transaction {
    address destination;
    uint value;
    bytes data;
    bool executed;
  }

  function submitTransaction(address destination, uint value, bytes memory data) public {
    require(msg.sender == _owner, "Only owner can submit transactions");
    uint transactionId = _transactionCount;
    _transactions[transactionId] = Transaction(destination, value, data, false);
    _transactionCount += 1;
  }

  function executeTransaction(uint transactionId) public {
    Transaction storage transaction = _transactions[transactionId];
    require(transaction.destination != address(0), "Transaction does not exist");
    require(!transaction.executed, "Transaction already executed");
    (bool success, ) = transaction.destination.call{value: transaction.value}(transaction.data);
    require(success, "Transaction execution failed");
    transaction.executed = true;
  }
}

Based on the analysis, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) privilege escalation
2) inconsistent state update
