Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `proposal.addr`, `lockedFunds`, `startingBalanceList`, and `startingBalance`, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unintended access.

- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is updated in multiple functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`), which could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state if not properly managed.

- Insufficient gas: Operations like token transfers and balance checks may require a significant amount of gas, which could lead to out-of-gas exceptions if not handled properly.

- Integer overflow/underflow: The code contains several arithmetic operations (`proposal.votedAmount += amount`, `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2`, etc.) that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not validated.

- Missing input validation: The contract does not have input validation checks for parameters like `amount` in the `execute` function, potentially allowing for unexpected or malicious inputs.

- Suicidal contracts: There is no check or mechanism in place to prevent the contract from being self-destructed, which could lead to the loss of funds and disruption of the contract's functionality.
