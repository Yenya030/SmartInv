1) Integer overflow in the variable `proposal.votedAmount`.
2) Inconsistent state update in the function `endExecute` where `lockedFunds` is not initialized or updated correctly.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership in the declaration of `lockedFunds` as it is not specified as public or internal.

So, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Integer overflow in `proposal.votedAmount`.
- Inconsistent state update in `endExecute`.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership of `lockedFunds`.
