The contract being analyzed contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the `votedProposal()` function, which can lead to potential issues with the function's accessibility and execution.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute()` function, the `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without verifying the success of the `votingToken.transferFrom()` function. This can lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract if the transfer fails after incrementing `proposal.votedAmount`.

3) Atomicity violation: In the `execute()` function, multiple state changes occur without using appropriate mechanisms like a reentrancy guard, which can lead to potential atomicity violations and reentrancy attacks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and atomicity violation.
