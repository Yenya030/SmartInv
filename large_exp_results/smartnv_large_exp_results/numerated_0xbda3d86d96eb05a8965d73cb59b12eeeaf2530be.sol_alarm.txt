The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` is updating the `lockedFunds` variable without any protection against reentrancy, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are declared as public, which exposes sensitive information to all users. Consider changing the visibility to `internal` or `private` depending on the requirements.

3) Arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate` function, the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if the values are large, leading to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and arithmetic flaw.
