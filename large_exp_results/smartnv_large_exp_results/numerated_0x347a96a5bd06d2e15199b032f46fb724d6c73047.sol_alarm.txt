Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Privilege escalation: There is no verification mechanism to ensure that only the owner can end the auction, making it vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the highestBidder before transferring the funds, potentially leading to incorrect state updates if the transfer fails.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is used without being defined in the contract, potentially leading to incorrect ownership verification.
