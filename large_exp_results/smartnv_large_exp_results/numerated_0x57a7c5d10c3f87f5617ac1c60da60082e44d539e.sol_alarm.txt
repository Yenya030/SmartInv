The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using a safe arithmetic function, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function, but its visibility is not specified. This could lead to issues with contract logic and accessibility.
3) Reentrancy: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract calls external contracts (USDC and WETH) before updating the contract state. This opens up the possibility of reentrancy attacks.
4) Arithmetic flaw: The `liquidate` function uses arithmetic operations with user input values (`getPrice()` * `cAmount` * 80 / 100), which could lead to arithmetic flaws like integer overflow or underflow. 
5) Ether leakage: The `calculatePrice` function does not seem to be correctly calculating the price and returning it, which could lead to potential ether leakage if users rely on this function for accurate calculations.
