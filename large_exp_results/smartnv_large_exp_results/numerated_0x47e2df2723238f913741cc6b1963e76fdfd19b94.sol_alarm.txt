The contract to analyze is:

contract Purchase {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    uint public price;

    function initiatePurchase(uint _price) external {
        require(msg.sender != seller, "Seller cannot initiate purchase");
        price = _price;
        buyer = msg.sender;
    }

    function transferFunds() external {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can transfer funds");
        seller.transfer(price);
    }
}

Based on the code provided, potential vulnerabilities in the Purchase contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The seller can initiate the purchase by calling 'initiatePurchase' instead of the buyer, allowing the seller to potentially manipulate the transaction.

2) Atomicity violation: The transfer of funds to the seller in the 'transferFunds' function could be vulnerable to race conditions or reentrancy attacks if not handled properly.

3) Insufficient gas: The transfer of funds in the 'transferFunds' function may fail if the seller's contract does not have enough gas to receive the funds, resulting in an incomplete transaction.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the Purchase contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, and insufficient gas.
