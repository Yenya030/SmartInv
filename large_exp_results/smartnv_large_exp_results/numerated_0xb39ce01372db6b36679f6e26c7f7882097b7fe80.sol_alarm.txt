The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership control for its functions or variables, which can lead to security issues.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not have any considerations for gas limits, which could potentially result in out-of-gas errors during contract execution.

3) Inconsistent state update: The function 'startExecute()' updates the proposal state without ensuring atomicity, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations involving integers without proper checks for overflow or underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, leaving potential vulnerabilities for Ether leakage.

6) Business logic flaw: There might be potential business logic flaws in the contract that could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
