contract EscrowContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public escrowBalance;

    function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
        escrowBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(escrowBalance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        escrowBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
The potential vulnerabilities in the EscrowContract are:
- Integer Overflow/Underflow: When handling the escrowBalance, if the amount exceeds the maximum value that uint256 can hold, an integer overflow can occur.
- Inconsistent State Update: The deposit function directly increases the escrowBalance without properly checking for potential reentrancy issues, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient Gas: If a user tries to withdraw an amount that exceeds their current escrowBalance, the contract will revert, consuming gas without the user being able to receive any funds.
