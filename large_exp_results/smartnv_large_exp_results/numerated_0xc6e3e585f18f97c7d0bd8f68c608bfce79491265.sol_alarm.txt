Contract to analyze:
<\TimelockController\> 
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");

}

Potential vulnerabilities in the <\TimelockController\> contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() initializes 'startingBalance' with a misspelled variable 'startingBlance', likely leading to unintended behavior.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, it should be checked whether this is the intended visibility or if it should be public or private.
3) insufficient gas: If the actions within the functions consume a large amount of gas, there may be a risk of running out of gas mid-transaction.
4) business logic flaw: The requirements for proposal timing and voting may need further analysis to ensure they align with the intended business logic.
5) ID uniqueness violation: The uniqueness of proposal IDs should be considered to avoid conflicts or confusion.
