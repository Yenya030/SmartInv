The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) business logic flaw: The withdrawal function does not include the actual logic for transferring tokens to the owner, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership check in the withdrawTokens function should be made private to prevent unauthorized access to token withdrawal.
3) atomicity violation: The buyTokens function should consider using the SafeMath library to prevent overflow/underflow issues in tokenBalances and totalTokens calculations.
