The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to unauthorized access or manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct is updated directly without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than expected, leading to failed transactions or unexpected behavior.
