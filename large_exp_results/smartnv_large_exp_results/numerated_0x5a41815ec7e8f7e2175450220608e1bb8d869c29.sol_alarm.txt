The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract PurchaseContract {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    bool public itemReceived;
    uint public price;

    modifier onlyBuyer() {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can call this function");
        _;
    }

    constructor(address _seller, uint _price) {
        seller = _seller;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyItem() public payable {
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        seller.transfer(msg.value);
        buyer = msg.sender;
    }

    function receiveItem() public onlyBuyer {
        itemReceived = true;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) atomicity violation - The payment transfer in the `buyItem` function and updating the `buyer` address are not done atomically, which can lead to inconsistencies if the transfer fails after setting the buyer address.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership - The `itemReceived` variable is public, allowing anyone to check if the item has been received. This may expose sensitive information and violate ownership control.
3) inconsistent state update - The state of `itemReceived` is updated by the `onlyBuyer` modifier in the `receiveItem` function, but there is no check to ensure that the item was actually purchased before marking it as received, leading to an inconsistent state update.
4) insufficient gas - The contract does not implement any gas stipend for transfer functions, which may cause them to fail if the recipient contract does not have enough gas to receive the transfer.
5) incorrect visibility/ownership - The `seller` and `price` variables are public, potentially exposing sensitive information and violating ownership control. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: atomicity violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas.
