The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) inconsistent state update: The state variables buyerApproved and sellerApproved are updated independently, allowing for a situation where both buyer and seller have approved, but the releaseAmount function checks for both approvals separately.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The refundAmount function only checks for the arbiter's address, but does not restrict access based on buyer or seller, potentially allowing unauthorized access to refund the amount.
