The contract provided for analysis:
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    uint public totalTokens;
    mapping(address => uint) public tokenBalance;

    constructor(address _token, uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = IERC20(_token);
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
        totalTokens = _totalTokens;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _numTokens * tokenPrice, "Incorrect payment amount");
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _numTokens, "Not enough tokens available");
        
        tokenBalance[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _numTokens);
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
        
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The tokenBalance mapping is updated without any check on the totalTokens value, which can lead to an inconsistent state if totalTokens is not properly managed.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The withdrawFunds function only checks for owner address equality, which can be vulnerable to privilege escalation if the owner address is easily guessable or can be manipulated.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle out-of-gas exceptions which can lead to failed transactions and potential disruptions in the contract's operations.
4) Business logic flaw: There is no validation for the totalTokens value, which could result in unexpected behavior if the totalTokens value is set incorrectly.
5) Atomicity violation: The buyTokens function involves multiple operations (updating tokenBalance and transferring tokens), which could be vulnerable to race conditions if not properly handled for atomicity.
