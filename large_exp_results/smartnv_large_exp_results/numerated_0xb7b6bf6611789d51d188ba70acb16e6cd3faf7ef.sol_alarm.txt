The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates `lockedFunds` without utilizing a locking mechanism, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update `lockedFunds` concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which can potentially lead to unexpected behaviors if it should be accessed by external contracts or users.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute()` function may run out of gas if the `votingToken.transferFrom()` or `votedProposal()` functions consume a considerable amount of gas, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct doesn't seem to have a unique identifier assigned to each proposal, which could lead to conflicts or confusion if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously. 

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and ID uniqueness violation.
