Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The function buyTokens could potentially allow for integer overflow if a user tries to purchase a very large number of tokens, causing unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function buyTokens updates the balance of tokens without deducting the purchased tokens from the totalTokens variable, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The withdraw function does not check if the caller is the owner, allowing anyone to call the function and withdraw funds from the contract.
4) Insufficient gas: If the contract holds a large amount of funds, the transfer in the withdraw function may require more gas than the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail.
