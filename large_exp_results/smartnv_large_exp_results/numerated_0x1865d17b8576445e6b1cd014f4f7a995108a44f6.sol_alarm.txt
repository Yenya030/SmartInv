The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the collateral and debt mappings without proper validation or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function could potentially result in an arithmetic flaw due to the multiplication and division operations without proper overflow/underflow checks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and arithmetic flaw.
