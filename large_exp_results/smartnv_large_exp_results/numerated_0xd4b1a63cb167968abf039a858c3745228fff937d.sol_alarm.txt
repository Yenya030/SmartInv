The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the `balanceOf(address(this))`, which might not accurately reflect the funds locked due to asynchronous calls or transfers within the same block.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which can lead to unexpected behaviors or unauthorized access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
