The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not specified with a visibility specifier, which can lead to unexpected behavior in terms of access control.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a potential issue with gas consumption in the `endExecute` function as the gas cost of the operations performed may exceed the gas limit for the transaction.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have any unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously.

5) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single transaction, leading to potential race conditions and inconsistent state updates.
