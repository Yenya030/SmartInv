The contract in question has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a large amount of gas if `votingToken.transferFrom` and `votedProposal` functions consume a significant amount of gas. If there is insufficient gas provided, the transaction may fail midway, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the `votingToken` held by the contract. However, this update does not occur atomically with the balance check, potentially leading to an inconsistent state if the balance changes between the check and update.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `proposal` struct and the `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined. Depending on the intended functionality, these variables may need to be adjusted to ensure proper visibility and ownership.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `startExecute` function sets up a new proposal without explicitly ensuring that duplicate proposals with conflicting IDs cannot be created. This could lead to issues with managing and tracking proposals correctly.

5) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function increments the `proposal.votedAmount` without using a mutex or other synchronization mechanism. If multiple transactions attempt to modify the same proposal concurrently, it could result in inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.

6) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks whether the executed proposal was successful based on a comparison involving the total supply of the `votingToken`. This logic may not accurately reflect the success criteria for the proposal execution, potentially leading to incorrect outcomes.
