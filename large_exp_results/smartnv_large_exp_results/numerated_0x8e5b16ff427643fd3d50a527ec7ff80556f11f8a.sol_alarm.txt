Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce any access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to only the owner or specific roles.
2) inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is updated directly without using safe arithmetic operations, which may lead to inconsistent state if multiple calls are made simultaneously.
3) atomicity violation: The execute function does not implement atomicity when transferring tokens, which can lead to inconsistent state if one of the transfer functions fails.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which might unintentionally expose it to external contracts and compromise ownership control.
