contract PaymentContract {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, exposing the owner's address to anyone. This can lead to privilege escalation if the owner should not be publicly known.

2) Ether leakage: The transfer of funds in the withdraw function uses a low-level call that does not handle potential errors properly. This can lead to ether being locked in the contract if the transfer fails.

3) Insufficient gas: The transfer of funds in the withdraw function does not include a stipend for gas, which can potentially result in the transfer failing due to running out of gas.

4) Inconsistent state update: The balances mapping is directly updated without proper checks or validations, which can lead to inconsistent or incorrect balances being stored.
