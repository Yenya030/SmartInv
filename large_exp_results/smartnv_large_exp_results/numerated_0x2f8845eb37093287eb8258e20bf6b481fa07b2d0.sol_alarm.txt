Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBalanceList` mapping is not explicitly defined in the contract and might have unintended visibility or accessibility issues.

3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle the transfer of Ether, leaving room for potential Ether leakage vulnerabilities in interactions with other contracts.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is a lack of checks to ensure uniqueness in the `proposal.addr` variable, which could lead to ID duplication issues.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract may require more gas than available for certain operations, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

6) Business logic flaw: Certain conditions in the contract's functions may have unintended consequences or logical errors that could be exploited.

7) Atomicity violation: The operations within functions such as `execute` are not wrapped in a single atomic unit, leaving room for partial execution and inconsistent results.

8) Arithmetic flaw: The arithmetic operations in the `ExchangeTokens` contract, specifically in the `liquidate` function, could potentially lead to arithmetic flaws like overflows or underflows.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Ether leakage
- ID uniqueness violation
- Insufficient gas
- Business logic flaw
- Atomicity violation
- Arithmetic flaw
