Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the state variable lockedFunds without appropriate checks or validations, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential risk of integer overflow in the calculatePrice function if the calculation result exceeds the maximum value that uint can hold. 

3) Insufficient gas: If the operations within the liquidate function consume too much gas, it may result in the transaction failing due to insufficient gas.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables debt and collateral should be private to prevent external manipulation. Additionally, ownership controls should be implemented to restrict access to critical functions.
