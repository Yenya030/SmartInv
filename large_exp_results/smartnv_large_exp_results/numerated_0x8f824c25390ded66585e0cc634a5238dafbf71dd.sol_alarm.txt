Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of user IDs, which could potentially lead to issues with data integrity or functionality.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not address visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access or manipulation by external entities.
