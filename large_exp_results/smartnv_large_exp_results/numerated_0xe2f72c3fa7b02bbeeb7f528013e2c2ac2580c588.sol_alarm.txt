potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (IERC20 is not defined in the contract)
- Inconsistent state update (startingBalanceList is used without being defined in the contract)
- Integer overflow/underflow (proposal.votedAmount could potentially lead to overflow)
- Insufficient gas (the gas limit for certain functions is not specified)
- Privilege escalation (owner variable is not utilized for authorization checks)
