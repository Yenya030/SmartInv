The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variables proposal and startingBalanceList without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20, but it does not define all the necessary functions required by the interface, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership vulnerabilities.
