The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function in the contract can potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple executions happen concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as an internal, which may not be the desired visibility, as it restricts access to it.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential scenarios where transactions may run out of gas during execution.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
