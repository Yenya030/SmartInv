Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without any further checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled properly. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface, but it is unclear if the necessary functions are implemented correctly and whether the contract has proper ownership control over these functions. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
