This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function in TimelockController could potentially allow for the execution of proposals even after the designated time has ended.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function in TimelockController may not properly handle state updates related to the votedAmount of a proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The TimelockController contract does not ensure unique identifiers for proposals or addresses in the startingBalanceList mapping, which could result in unexpected behavior.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract does not specify explicit visibility for the internal owner variable, which could lead to issues with the contract's ownership logic.
