Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute()` function checks if the execution has ended based on a time condition, but it does not consider potential cases where the execution might not have ended due to other factors.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute()` function without taking into account potential reentrancy issues or ensuring atomicity of the update.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `owner` variable and the implementation of the `IERC20` interface are not specified, which could lead to ownership vulnerabilities or visibility issues.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function performs a potentially expensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) without considering gas limits, which could result in out-of-gas errors.
