The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to confusion or errors when handling multiple proposals.
2) inconsistent state update: In the function execute(), the votedAmount is updated directly in the proposal struct without using safe arithmetic operations, which could result in inconsistent state updates due to integer overflow/underflow.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal variables owner and votingToken may need to be properly scoped or controlled for visibility and ownership issues.
4) insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limits and complexity of the contract functions, there may be a risk of running out of gas during execution, leading to incomplete transactions or contract failures. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are - ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
