Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable proposal without properly initializing it or checking for existing proposals, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, which may lead to visibility issues or ownership problems.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may fail to execute if there is not enough gas provided, which can result in the funds being locked indefinitely.
