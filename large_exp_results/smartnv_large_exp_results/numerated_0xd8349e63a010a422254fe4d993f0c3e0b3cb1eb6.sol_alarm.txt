Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute()" function without any protection against reentry or multiple calls, which could lead to unpredictable behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is declared as "internal" but is not used or properly implemented, which could lead to ownership control issues.
