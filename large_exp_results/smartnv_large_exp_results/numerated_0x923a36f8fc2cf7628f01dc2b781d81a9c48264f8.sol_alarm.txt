The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute()` function is updated based on the balance of the contract, which may not accurately reflect the actual locked funds if there are concurrent interactions with the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is defined as a state variable, which could potentially expose sensitive data to external parties and should be private to prevent unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The execution of the `endExecute()` function may require an excessive amount of gas due to the computation of `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
