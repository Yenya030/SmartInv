Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal struct without any checks for proper initialization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function checks for a condition that involves reading the balance of the contract, which could consume excessive gas and fail if the gas limit is reached.

Overall Assessment: The contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates and insufficient gas management.
