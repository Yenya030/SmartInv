Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
   - In the `liquidate` function, the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` could potentially result in integer overflow if the values involved are large enough.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The visibility of the `calculatePrice` function is set to public, which allows anyone to call it and potentially manipulate the price calculations or information.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - There may be potential issues with gas consumption when executing functions like `liquidate` or `calculatePrice` that involve token transfers and complex calculations, leading to out-of-gas errors. 

Overall Assessment: The contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to integer overflow/underflow, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
