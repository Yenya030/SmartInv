Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedProposal" function is mentioned in the code snippet but not defined, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if it performs critical operations.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the internal state variable "owner" is not specified, which could potentially lead to ownership vulnerabilities.

3) Ether leakage: There are no checks or mechanisms in place to prevent unintended or unauthorized ether transfers, which could lead to ether leakage vulnerabilities.
