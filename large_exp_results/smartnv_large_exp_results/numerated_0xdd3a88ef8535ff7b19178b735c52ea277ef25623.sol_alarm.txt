The contract in focus:
```
contract TokenSale {
    address public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) external {
        require(msg.value == _amount * price);
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(token, owner, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Price manipulation
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
