The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    uint public totalTokensSold;

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _numTokens * tokenPrice, "Incorrect value sent");
        
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _numTokens);
        balances[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
        totalTokensSold += _numTokens;
    }

    function withdrawEther() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not have checks for potential integer overflow or underflow in the calculations involving tokens and prices. 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the contract owner.
3) Insufficient gas: The `withdrawEther` function does not specify the amount of gas required for the operation, which could potentially lead to insufficient gas issues.
