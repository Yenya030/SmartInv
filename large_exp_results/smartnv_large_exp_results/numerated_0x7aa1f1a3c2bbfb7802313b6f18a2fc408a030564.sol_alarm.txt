The contract to analyze:

contract VoteSystem {
     struct Proposal {
          uint256 startTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address proposer; 
          }
     address public owner;
     IERC20 public votingToken;
     Proposal public proposal;

    function startVoting() external {
              require(proposal.startTime == 0, "voting already started");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
        }

    function vote(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.startTime + 48 hours > block.timestamp, "voting period ended");
              require(amount > 0, "voting amount must be positive");
              votingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
        }

    function endVoting() external {
              require(proposal.startTime != 0, "no active proposal");
              require(proposal.startTime + 48 hours < block.timestamp, "voting period not ended yet");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) * 2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "voting failed");
        }
}

Based on the analysis, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Atomicity violation in the endVoting() function as there is no atomic check for the conditions before updating the state.
2) Integer overflow/underflow in the vote() function if the addition in proposal.votedAmount exceeds the uint256 limit.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability as owner should be declared as public in the contract.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the "VoteSystem" contract are atomicity violation, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
