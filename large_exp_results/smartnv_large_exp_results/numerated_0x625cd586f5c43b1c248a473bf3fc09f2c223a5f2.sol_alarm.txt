The contract for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
      struct Proposal {
            uint256 startTime;
            uint256 endTime;
            uint256 votedAmount;
            address proposer;
            bool executed;
        }
        
        mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
        uint256 public proposalId;

        function createProposal(uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime) external {
            proposals[proposalId] = Proposal(_startTime, _endTime, 0, msg.sender, false);
            proposalId++;
        }

        function voteProposal(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _amount) external {
            require(proposals[_proposalId].startTime < block.timestamp, "voting not started yet");
            require(proposals[_proposalId].endTime > block.timestamp, "voting has ended");
            require(!proposals[_proposalId].executed, "proposal already executed");
            
            // Handle voting logic here
            proposals[_proposalId].votedAmount += _amount;
        }

        function executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) external {
            require(proposals[_proposalId].endTime < block.timestamp, "voting has not ended");
            require(proposals[_proposalId].votedAmount > 0, "no votes for the proposal");
            
            // Execute the proposal logic here
            proposals[_proposalId].executed = true;
        }
}


Output:
The potential vulnerabilities in the "VotingSystem" contract are:
1) Business logic flaw: The "executeProposal" function does not check for the uniqueness of proposal ID, allowing for the execution of the same proposal multiple times.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "executeProposal" function does not handle state updates atomically, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "proposals" mapping is set to public, which exposes sensitive data to all external parties interacting with the contract.
