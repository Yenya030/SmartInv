The contract under analysis for potential vulnerabilities is:

```
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
        uint256 startingBlance;
        require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
        proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
        startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
        startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 
    }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
        require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
        votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
        proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
        votedProposal(proposal); 
    }

    function endExecute() external {
        require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
        require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
        lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state of the proposal in `execute()` function but does not check for reentrancy.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is internal, which might not be the intended visibility.
3) Business logic flaw: The logic around value checking and updates in the functions may need to be thoroughly reviewed for any potential business logic vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
