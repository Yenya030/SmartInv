Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract without considering the possibility of other transactions affecting the balance during the function execution.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `liquidate(address user)` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract transfers tokens between users without considering the gas limit, which may lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
