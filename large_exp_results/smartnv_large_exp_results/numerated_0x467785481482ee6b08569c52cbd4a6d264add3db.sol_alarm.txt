The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function without proper validation or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is declared as a storage variable, but it is accessed directly in the 'startExecute', 'execute', and 'endExecute' functions without proper access control or visibility specifier, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function contains a potentially costly operation by checking if the balance of a contract is greater than half of the total supply. This operation may require significant gas and could potentially lead to out-of-gas exceptions.

4) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the 'liquidate' function involving multiplying the price, collateral amount, and a percentage value could lead to arithmetic flaws such as overflow or underflow if the values are not properly validated.

5) Privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce appropriate access control mechanisms, allowing any user to perform functions like 'liquidate' without proper authorization. This can lead to privilege escalation attacks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, arithmetic flaw, and privilege escalation.
