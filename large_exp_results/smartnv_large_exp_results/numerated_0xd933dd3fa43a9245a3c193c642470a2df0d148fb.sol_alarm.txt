Potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided:
1) Privilege escalation: The TimelockController contract potentially allows the owner to start and end proposal executions, which could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The TimelockController contract updates the votedAmount in the execute function without checking for multiple updates, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function in the TimelockController contract may fail due to insufficient gas if the gas limit is reached during the execution.
