The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the `startExecute` function to be called externally, which sets the proposal with the caller's address. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation if the caller is not intended to have such authority.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` is updated by incrementing it with the passed `amount` parameter. However, there is no check to ensure that the total voted amount doesn't exceed a certain limit, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified in the contract. It is unclear whether this variable should be publicly accessible or restricted to certain functions. Additionally, the ownership of some functions and variables is not specified, which could lead to potential security risks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
