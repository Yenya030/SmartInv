Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms to restrict who can call certain functions, which can lead to privilege escalation attacks.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is updated directly in the proposal struct without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculation of startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] in the startExecute function.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves looping through balances, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas, leading to insufficient gas for the function execution.
