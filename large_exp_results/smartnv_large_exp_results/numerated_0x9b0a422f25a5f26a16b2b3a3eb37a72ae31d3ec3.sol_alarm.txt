The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Insufficient gas - The functions in the contract might require more gas than is provided, leading to the functions not being executed properly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - It is not clear who has ownership of the contract and which functions can be accessed by external parties, potentially leading to unauthorized access and misuse.
