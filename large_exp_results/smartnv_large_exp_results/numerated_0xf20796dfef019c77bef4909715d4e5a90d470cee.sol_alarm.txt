Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without any checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function of ExchangeTokens contract for liquidation amount using getPrice() potentially opens up an arithmetic flaw if the inputs are not properly validated.

3) Ether leakage: There is no specific protection against ether leakage in the contract, which could lead to unintended loss of funds.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the mappings debt and collateral in the ExchangeTokens contract is set to public, which might expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
