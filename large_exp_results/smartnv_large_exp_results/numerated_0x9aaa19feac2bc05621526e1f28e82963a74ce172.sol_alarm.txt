The contract being analyzed:
contract PaymentGateway {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function updateOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can update the owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function processPayment(uint amount) public {
        // Process payment logic
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentGateway contract are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership (updateOwner function allows anyone to change the owner)
- privilege escalation (updateOwner function does not restrict who can become the new owner)
- insufficient gas (processPayment function does not specify gas limits which can lead to out of gas errors)
