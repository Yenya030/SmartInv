The contract in question contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() updates multiple state variables (proposal.votedAmount and votedProposal) without proper atomicity, potentially allowing for unexpected behavior.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of checks for integer overflow/underflow in various arithmetic operations within the contract, such as in the execute() function.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not properly define all required functions, leading to incorrect visibility and potential ownership vulnerabilities.
