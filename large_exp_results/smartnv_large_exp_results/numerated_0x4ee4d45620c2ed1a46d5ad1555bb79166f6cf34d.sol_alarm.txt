Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `debt` and `collateral` are updated independently in the `liquidate` function without considering potential race conditions or inconsistencies between them.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate` function could potentially result in arithmetic overflow if the values are large.
3) Ether leakage: There is no proper handling of Ether transactions in the contract, which could potentially lead to Ether leakage or loss.
