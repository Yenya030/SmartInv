Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for this variable and could lead to accessibility or ownership issues.
