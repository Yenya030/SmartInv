The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation by external entities.
2) ID Uniqueness Violation: The contract does not ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which can lead to confusion or conflicts in the system.
3) Inconsistent State Update: The state of the proposal struct is updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data and potential bugs.
4) Insufficient Gas: The endExecute function may require excessive gas to execute if the condition for execution failed is met, leading to potential issues with gas limit and contract execution.
5) Atomicity Violation: In the execute function, there is a sequence of operations that are not executed atomically, which can lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior. 

Output: 
ID Uniqueness Violation
Inconsistent State Update
Insufficient Gas
Atomicity Violation
