The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the `proposal` state when calling the `execute` function, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is not defined in the contract, which may result in incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.
