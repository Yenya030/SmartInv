The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined as public or internal, which can lead to potential unauthorized access or manipulation of proposal data by external contracts.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being modified in the `startExecute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions attempt to modify the same proposal simultaneously.
