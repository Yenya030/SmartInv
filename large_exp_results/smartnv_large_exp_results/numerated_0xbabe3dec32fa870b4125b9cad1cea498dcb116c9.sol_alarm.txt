Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract, such as startExecute, execute, and endExecute, perform multiple state changes without using any mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if one of the state changes fails.

2) Inconsistent state update: The proposal state variables are updated in different functions without proper checks, potentially leading to inconsistent or unexpected state changes.

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of functions, it could result in failed transactions or unexpected behavior.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions in the contract may not be appropriately set, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation by external parties.
