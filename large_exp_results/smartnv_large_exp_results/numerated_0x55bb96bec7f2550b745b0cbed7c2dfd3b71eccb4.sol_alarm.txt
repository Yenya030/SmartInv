The contract provided:

contract MultiSigWallet {
     address[] public owners;
     uint public transactionCount;
     mapping(uint => Transaction) public transactions;
     
     struct Transaction {
          address destination;
          uint value;
          bytes data;
          bool executed;
     }

     function submitTransaction(address destination, uint value, bytes memory data) public {
          transactions[transactionCount] = Transaction(destination, value, data, false);
          transactionCount++;
     }
} 

output:
- missing access control: the submitTransaction function does not have any access control mechanism, allowing anyone to submit a transaction.
- inconsistent state update: the transactionCount is incremented after assigning the transaction to transactions mapping, it should be incremented beforehand to ensure consistency.
- potential reentrancy: the execute function is missing, assuming that transactions can be executed elsewhere, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerability if not handled properly.
