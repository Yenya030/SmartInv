This contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without any synchronization mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks if the execution failed by comparing the balance of the contract with twice the total supply of the votingToken. This operation might require a significant amount of gas if the total supply is large, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not specified with any visibility (public, private, internal, etc.), which can lead to potential issues related to ownership and access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
