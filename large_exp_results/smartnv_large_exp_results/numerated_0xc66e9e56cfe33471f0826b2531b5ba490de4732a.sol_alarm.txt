The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Reentrancy: The bid function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks since the transfer function is called before updating the highestBidder and highestBid values. An attacker can create a malicious contract that can call the bid function repeatedly before the state is updated, allowing them to drain funds from the contract.

2) Inconsistent state update: The order of updating the highestBidder and highestBid values may lead to inconsistent states if an exception is raised after the transfer function is called. This can leave the contract in an unpredictable state. 

3) Insufficient gas: The transfer function requires that the recipient is able to handle the gas cost associated with receiving the funds. If the highestBidder is a contract with a fallback function that requires a significant amount of gas, this transaction may fail due to running out of gas.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the highestBidder and highestBid variables is set to public, which exposes them to the entire blockchain. This may lead to privacy concerns or unintended behavior if other contracts can directly access or modify these variables.
