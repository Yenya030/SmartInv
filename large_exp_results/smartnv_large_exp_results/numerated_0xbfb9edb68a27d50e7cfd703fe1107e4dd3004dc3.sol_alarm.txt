The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the `proposal` struct is updated in the same transaction. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check for potential integer overflow in the `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` line in the `execute` function. This can cause unexpected behavior if `proposal.votedAmount` exceeds the maximum uint256 value.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which means it can only be accessed by the contract and its derived contracts. If external access is required, the visibility should be changed to public or external.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
