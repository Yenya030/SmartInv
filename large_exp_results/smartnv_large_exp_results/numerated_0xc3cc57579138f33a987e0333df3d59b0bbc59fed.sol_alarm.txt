The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, leaving them as public by default. It is important to explicitly define the visibility of functions and variables to prevent unauthorized access.

2) Inconsistent state update: The function 'endExecute' updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without checking if it meets certain conditions, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.

3) Atomicity violation: The function 'execute' involves multiple state changes and external calls, which could result in an atomicity violation if one of the operations fails, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas consumption of its functions, which may result in functions failing due to insufficient gas when executed.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of explicit checks for integer overflows and underflows in the contract, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the calculations result in values beyond the allowed range.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions appropriately, potentially leading to Ether leakage or loss of funds.
