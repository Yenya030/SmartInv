Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate within the ExchangeTokens contract updates the state variables debt and collateral without proper validation or checks, which could lead to inconsistent data storage.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The function liquidate within the ExchangeTokens contract contains a calculation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) that may result in arithmetic flaws such as integer overflow or underflow.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables WETH, USDC, and pair within the ExchangeTokens contract are declared as public, potentially exposing sensitive information and ownership to external contracts or users.
