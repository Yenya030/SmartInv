The potential vulnerabilities in the SmartContract are:
1) integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow or underflow in the totalSupply variable as deposits and withdrawals are directly modifying it. 
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which might expose sensitive information about the contract's owner. It should be made private or internal.
3) inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update if the balances are not properly updated during deposit and withdrawal operations.
