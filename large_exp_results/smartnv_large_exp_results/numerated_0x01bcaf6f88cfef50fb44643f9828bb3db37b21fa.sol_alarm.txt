Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if a proposal is already ongoing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide any implementation for the interface functions, which could lead to issues with contract ownership and visibility.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses the same proposal ID for each new proposal without ensuring uniqueness, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks the balance of the contract to be twice the total supply of the voting token, which could consume a large amount of gas and potentially lead to out of gas errors.
