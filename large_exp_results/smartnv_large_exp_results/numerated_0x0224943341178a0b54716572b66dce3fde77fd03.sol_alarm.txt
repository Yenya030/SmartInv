<\output\> 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The administrator address can be changed by anyone, not just the current administrator, making it vulnerable to privilege escalation.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no verification to ensure that the same address cannot vote multiple times, potentially leading to ID uniqueness violation.
