The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without correctly handling the state of other variables, such as `proposal.votedAmount`.
2) Atomicity violation: The function `endExecute` performs multiple state changes without using a locking mechanism to ensure atomicity.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal` and `lockedFunds`, which could lead to potential issues with contract state access.

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, atomicity violations, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
