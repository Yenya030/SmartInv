Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized users from calling critical functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limits and complexity of operations within functions, there is a risk of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the ownership of the contract and visibility of certain functions are properly defined, potentially leading to security risks.
