The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is being updated directly without any checks or validation, which can lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
2) Price manipulation: The function `liquidate` does not properly handle the calculation of price, which can lead to price manipulation if manipulated inputs are provided.
3) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function can result in integer overflow/underflow if the values are not checked properly before performing the arithmetic operations.
