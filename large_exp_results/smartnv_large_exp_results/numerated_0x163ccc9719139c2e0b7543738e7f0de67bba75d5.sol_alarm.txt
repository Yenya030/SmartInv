The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities in the form of:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility of the variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` is not specified. Additionally, the contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define the required functions, which may lead to ownership issues.

2) Inconsistent state update - The `execute` function updates the `proposal` state without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data updates and potential issues.

3) Insufficient gas - The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
