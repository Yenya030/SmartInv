The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute` function based on the balance of `votingToken` in the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state if the `votingToken` balance changes after the check but before updating `lockedFunds`.

2) Privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any caller to start a new proposal, potentially leading to unauthorized privilege escalation.

3) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit is low when calling functions such as `execute`, there is a risk that the transaction may run out of gas before completion, leading to incomplete execution of the function.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, and insufficient gas.
