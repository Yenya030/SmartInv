Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: Missing initialization of proposal before accessing its properties in startExecute function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared but not used or assigned any value.
3) Privilege escalation: The startExecute function allows anyone to start a new proposal.
4) Business logic flaw: Execution of the proposal can happen within a 24-hour window irrespective of the stakeholder's intention.
5) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of startingBalanceList is not specified, which can expose it to external manipulation.
