The contract provided for analysis contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute` function without proper checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract performs operations involving different tokens (votingToken and address(this)), which could result in data inconsistency or errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced but not defined in the contract, potentially leading to code execution issues. 

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities and should be reviewed and potentially updated to address these issues.
