Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function updates the debt and collateral mappings directly without proper validation, leading to potential inconsistencies in the data.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function performs arithmetic operations without proper checks for potential overflow or underflow, which can lead to unexpected results or vulnerabilities.
