The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, making it susceptible to access control issues.
- Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: The gas requirement for the functions is not specified, which could result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas.
