The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'execute' function updates the 'proposal.votedAmount' without considering potential reentrancy issues.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'startExecute' function and 'endExecute' function do not have any access control modifiers to restrict who can call these functions.

3) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the 'liquidate' function may lead to incorrect results due to potential arithmetic overflow/underflow.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and arithmetic flaw.
