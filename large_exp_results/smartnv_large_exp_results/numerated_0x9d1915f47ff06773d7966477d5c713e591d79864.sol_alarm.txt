The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct is being accessed without any visibility modifier, making it vulnerable to privilege escalation.
2) Atomicity violation: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update in the "execute" function where the "proposal.votedAmount" is incremented without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "startingBalanceList" is being accessed without any visibility modifier, making it vulnerable to external manipulation or privilege escalation.
