The contract to analyze is:

contract TokenSale {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Not enough tokens to buy");
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        // Transfer _amount tokens to msg.sender
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The transferOwnership function should only be accessible to the owner of the contract, but it does not have a visibility modifier (e.g., public, external, internal, private) indicating who can access it, which could lead to unauthorized transfers of ownership.
