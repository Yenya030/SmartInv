The contract to analyze:

contract Marketplace {
     address public owner;
     mapping(address => uint) public productPrices;
     mapping(address => uint) public productQuantities;

     modifier onlyOwner() {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
         _;
     }

     function setProductPrice(address product, uint price) public onlyOwner {
         productPrices[product] = price;
     }

     function purchaseProduct(address product, uint quantity) public payable {
         require(msg.value == productPrices[product] * quantity, "Incorrect payment amount");
         productQuantities[product] -= quantity;
         owner.transfer(msg.value);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The productQuantities mapping is being updated without proper validation, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which may expose it to manipulation by external parties.
