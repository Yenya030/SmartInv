Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The function `calculatePrice()` in the contract `ExchangeTokens` could potentially face an integer overflow if the balances of `USDC` and `WETH` exceed the maximum value that uint can hold.

2) Price manipulation: The function `liquidate(address user)` in the contract `ExchangeTokens` could be vulnerable to price manipulation if the price calculated by `getPrice()` is manipulated by an attacker to cause an inaccurate liquidation condition.
