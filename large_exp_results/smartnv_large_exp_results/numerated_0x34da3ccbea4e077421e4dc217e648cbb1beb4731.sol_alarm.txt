The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the lockedFunds variable, but there is no indication of how this variable is used or managed elsewhere in the contract. This could lead to inconsistent state updates and potential issues.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "lockedFunds" variable is not defined in the contract, so it is unclear who has ownership and access rights to this variable. This lack of clarity in visibility and ownership can lead to potential vulnerabilities.

3) Business logic flaw: The "endExecute" function checks if the total balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total token supply before updating the lockedFunds variable. This logic may not accurately determine if the execution was successful and could introduce a business logic flaw. 

Overall, the contract could potentially be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaws.
