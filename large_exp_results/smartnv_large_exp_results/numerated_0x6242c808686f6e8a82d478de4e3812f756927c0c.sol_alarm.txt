The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions if the gas provided is not enough for the operations to complete.
2) Inconsistent state update: There might be issues with the proper updating of state variables leading to inconsistent data within the contract.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Visibility and ownership of functions and variables may not be properly set, allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
