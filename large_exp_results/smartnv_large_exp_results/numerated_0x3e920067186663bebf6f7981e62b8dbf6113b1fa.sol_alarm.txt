Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security risks.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the function `liquidate()` if the calculation `cAmount * 80 / 100` results in a value greater than the maximum uint value.
3) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly checking if the conditions are met, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
