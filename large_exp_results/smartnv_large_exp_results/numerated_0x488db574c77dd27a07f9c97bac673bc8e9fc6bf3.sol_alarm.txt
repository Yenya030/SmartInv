Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access to critical functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The use of variables like "startingBlance" and "proposal.votedAmount" may lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled properly.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is unclear if the "owner" variable is properly managed and secured, which could lead to ownership control issues.
