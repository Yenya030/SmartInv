The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, which can be manipulated and lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is using the `internal` visibility for the `owner` variable, which may not provide the desired level of access control and ownership protection.
