This contract potentially contains the following vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any proper synchronization or checks, leaving room for potential inconsistencies in the state.

2) Integer overflow: There are several mathematical operations in the contract that involve arithmetic calculations. Without proper checks for overflow or underflow, there is a risk of encountering integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in this contract.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables in this contract is not explicitly defined. This lack of specificity can lead to potential issues with how these elements can be accessed and manipulated.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
