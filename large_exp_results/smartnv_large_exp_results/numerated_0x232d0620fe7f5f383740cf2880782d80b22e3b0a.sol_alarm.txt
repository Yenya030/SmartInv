The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal structure but doesn't initialize it properly, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but doesn't provide the necessary functions, such as balanceOf and transfer, which might lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

3) Business logic flaw: The endExecute() function checks if the balance of the contract is more than double the total supply of the voting token for execution, which may not accurately represent the correct business logic.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
