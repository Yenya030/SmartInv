Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function, but there is no update to the actual state of the contract to reflect this change.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping might have issues with ID uniqueness depending on how `proposal.addr` is generated.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as private, which can lead to potential unauthorized access or manipulation of proposal data. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
