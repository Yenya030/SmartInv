Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
8) reentrancy - The contract contains external calls to other contracts (such as `votingToken.transferFrom` and `USDC.transferFrom`) without utilizing proper reentrancy protection.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility of variables like `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` is not specified, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
7) ID uniqueness violation - The `addr` field in the `Proposal` struct is used as an identifier, but there is no check to ensure its uniqueness, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
3) business logic flaw - The logic in the `endExecute` function to determine whether execution was successful (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) may not accurately reflect the intended business logic.
5) atomicity violation - The update to `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function is not an atomic operation (incrementing it directly), which could lead to race conditions.
13) insufficient gas - The contract may run out of gas during certain operations like transferring tokens, which could result in transaction failures or unexpected behavior.
