Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the state variable "lockedFunds" based on the condition that may introduce inconsistent state if the conditions are met only after this variable is updated.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the "liquidate" function can potentially result in integer overflow if the values are large and not properly checked.
3) Atomicity violation: The "liquidate" function performs multiple state changes and external calls without proper atomicity, leaving room for potential issues if any of the calls fail midway.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of some state variables and functions (such as "debt" and "collateral" being public) may expose sensitive information and functionality to unauthorized users.
