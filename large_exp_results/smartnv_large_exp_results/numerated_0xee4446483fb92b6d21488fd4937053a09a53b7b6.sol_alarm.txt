Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any check or validation mechanism.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract, such as in the `liquidate()` function, which might be susceptible to integer overflow/underflow.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract relies on external calls to `transferFrom()` in functions like `liquidate()`, which can lead to out-of-gas errors if the gas limit is not enough for the transfer operation.
