The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: the function `endExecute()` updates `lockedFunds` without considering other factors, potentially leading to inconsistent data state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the visibility of certain variables and functions is not specified, which may lead to unintended access and manipulation.
