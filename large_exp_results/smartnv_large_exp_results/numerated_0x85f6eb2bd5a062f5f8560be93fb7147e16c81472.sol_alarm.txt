Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable debt is updated directly in the function liquidate without proper validation or checks.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a calculation in the function calculatePrice which involves division and may cause integer overflow/underflow if not handled properly.
