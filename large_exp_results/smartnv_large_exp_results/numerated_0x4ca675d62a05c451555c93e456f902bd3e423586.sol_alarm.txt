The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute sets the value of startingBalanceList[proposal.addr], but the key proposal.addr is not defined in the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions votingToken.transferFrom and votedProposal, which can lead to incorrect accessibility and ownership concerns.
