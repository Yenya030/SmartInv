Contract to analyze:

contract MyContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public value;

    function setValue(uint _value) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set value");
        value = _value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in MyContract:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
