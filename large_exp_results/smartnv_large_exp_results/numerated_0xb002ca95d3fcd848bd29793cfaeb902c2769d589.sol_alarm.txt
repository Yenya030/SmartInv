On analyzing the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal by incrementing the votedAmount without any check for double voting. This could lead to inconsistent data in the contract.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a complex calculation to check if the execution failed, which could potentially run out of gas and cause the function to fail.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet provided, but if the visibility and ownership of functions and variables are not properly specified, it could lead to vulnerabilities related to unauthorized access and manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
