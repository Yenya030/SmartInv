Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract's state variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` are updated in the `startExecute` function without any synchronization mechanism, potentially leading to inconsistent states.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not fully define all the required functions of the interface, which could lead to ownership issues or incorrect function visibility.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract in relation to the total token supply, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas and lead to out-of-gas errors.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not handle the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or overwrite data unintentionally.

5) Atomicity violation: Operations in the `execute` function such as transferring tokens and updating proposal state variables are not performed atomically, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state if an operation fails midway.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, leaving it vulnerable to potential ether leakage.

7) Privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce proper access control mechanisms, allowing any address to call functions like `execute` and potentially perform unauthorized actions.

8) Business logic flaw: The contract logic for executing proposals and determining execution success may be flawed, as it does not consider all possible scenarios and could lead to unintended consequences.

9) Reentrancy: The contract contains multiple external function calls that could potentially be exploited for reentrancy attacks if not properly handled.
