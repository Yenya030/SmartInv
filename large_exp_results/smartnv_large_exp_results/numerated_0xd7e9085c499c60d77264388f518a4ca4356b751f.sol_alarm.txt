The contract you provided is:

contract SmartContract {
         IERC20 public token1;
         IERC20 public token2;

         function tradeTokens(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
             require(token1.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount1, "Insufficient balance of token1");
             require(token2.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount2, "Insufficient balance of token2");

             token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
             token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
         }
  }

The potential vulnerabilities in this contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows the transfer of token1 from the sender to the contract before transferring token2 to the sender, which can lead to an inconsistent state if the transfer of token2 fails after token1 has been transferred.

2) Cross-bridge inconsistency: The contract relies on balances from different ERC20 tokens (token1 and token2), which may come from different blockchains or sources, leading to cross-bridge inconsistency.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the token1 and token2 variables is set to public, which can expose sensitive information about the contract's state to external parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the SmartContract are Inconsistent state update, Cross-bridge inconsistency, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
