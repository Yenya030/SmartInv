The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables `lockedFunds`, `startingBalanceList`, and `proposal` is not specified, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `execute` function does not update the `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct atomically, which can lead to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas supplied to complete the function execution, leading to potential issues.
4) Privilege escalation: The ownership of the contract is assigned to `owner` but is not utilized or enforced in any function, which can lead to potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Privilege escalation
