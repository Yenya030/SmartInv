Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `lockedFunds` without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, which could potentially lead to ownership or visibility vulnerabilities.
