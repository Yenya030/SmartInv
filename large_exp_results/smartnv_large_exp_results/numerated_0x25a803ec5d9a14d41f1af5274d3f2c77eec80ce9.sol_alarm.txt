Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation: The `vote` function allows only the admin to vote, which can lead to privilege escalation if the admin's account is compromised.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin is set in the constructor using `msg.sender`, but there are no access control mechanisms to change the admin or restrict access to certain functions.
- ID uniqueness violation: The `votes` mapping does not consider unique voters, which could lead to overwriting existing votes for the same address.
