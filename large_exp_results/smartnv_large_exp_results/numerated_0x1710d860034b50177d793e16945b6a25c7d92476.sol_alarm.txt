Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any conditions or checks, which could lead to unexpected behavior or state inconsistencies.
2) insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a gas-intensive operation by checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may require more gas than available, leading to the transaction failing.
