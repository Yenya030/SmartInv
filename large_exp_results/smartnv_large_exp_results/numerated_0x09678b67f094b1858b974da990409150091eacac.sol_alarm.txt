The contract specified for analysis is:

contract Purchase {
    uint public price;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        price = 100;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setPrice(uint _price) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set the price");
        price = _price;
    }

    function buy() public payable {
        require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient funds");
        owner.transfer(msg.value);
        // Perform purchase logic
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
3) business logic flaw
5) atomicity violation
8) reentrancy
12) ether leakage
