The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables and functions that update these variables, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if not properly managed.
2) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract perform multiple state changes that are not wrapped in a single atomic operation, which may lead to unexpected behavior if one of the state changes fails.
3) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract perform multiple operations that consume gas, and there is a risk of running out of gas during the execution of these functions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract may have functions or state variables that are not properly set as public, internal, or external, leading to potential access control issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
