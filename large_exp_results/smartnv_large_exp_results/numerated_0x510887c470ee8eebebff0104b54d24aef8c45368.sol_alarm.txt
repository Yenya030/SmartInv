Contract to be analyzed:

contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public payments;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function makePayment(uint256 id, uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can make payments");
        
        payments[id] += amount;
    }
}

Output: 
incorrect visibility/ownership
