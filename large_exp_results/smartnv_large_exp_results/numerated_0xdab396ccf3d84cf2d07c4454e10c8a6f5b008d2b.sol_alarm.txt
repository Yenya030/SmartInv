The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function without considering potential reentrancy issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is being accessed externally in the 'execute' function, which can lead to issues with data visibility and ownership control.
