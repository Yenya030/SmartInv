Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- The contract is missing access control functions (such as modifiers) for certain sensitive functions, which could lead to privilege escalation.
- The use of arithmetic operations without proper overflow/underflow checks could result in integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
- The contract directly interacts with external contracts (e.g., `votingToken`, `USDC`, `WETH`), which could be susceptible to reentrancy attacks if not handled properly.
- There is a lack of visibility/ownership control for certain variables and functions, which could result in incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerabilities.
