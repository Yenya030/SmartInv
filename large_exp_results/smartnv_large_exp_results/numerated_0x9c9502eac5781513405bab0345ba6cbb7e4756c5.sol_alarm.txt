The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the "proposal" variable and the "startingBalanceList" mapping, which could potentially lead to access control issues.

2) Inconsistent State Update: The "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" statement in the "execute" function directly updates the state variable without proper checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient Gas: The "endExecute" function does not specify how much gas is required for its execution, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.

4) Inconsistent State Update: The "lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));" statement in the "endExecute" function is assigning the balance of the contract directly without any further processing, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
