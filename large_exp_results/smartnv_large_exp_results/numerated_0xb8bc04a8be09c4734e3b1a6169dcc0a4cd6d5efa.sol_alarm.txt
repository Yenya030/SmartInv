The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() does not update the state variable proposal.sTime, which might lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables WETH, USDC, and pair in the ExchangeTokens contract are declared as public, which might expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access.
3) Insufficient gas: The liquidate() function in the ExchangeTokens contract might require more gas than the block gas limit due to the potential loop in transferring funds, leading to insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.
