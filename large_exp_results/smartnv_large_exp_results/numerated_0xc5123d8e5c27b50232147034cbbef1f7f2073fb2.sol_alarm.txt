Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal struct without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is declared but not used or defined, which may lead to ownership vulnerabilities if ownership mechanisms are intended but not implemented.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function checks a condition that involves looping over all balances, which may consume large amounts of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
