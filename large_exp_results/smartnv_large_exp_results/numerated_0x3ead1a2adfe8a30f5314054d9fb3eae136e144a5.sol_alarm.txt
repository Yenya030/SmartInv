Contract:
contract PaymentContract {
         address public payer;
         uint public amount;

         function pay(address _receiver, uint _amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can initiate payment");
             _receiver.transfer(_amount);
         }

         function setPayment(address _payer, uint _amount) public {
             payer = _payer;
             amount = _amount;
         }
     }
