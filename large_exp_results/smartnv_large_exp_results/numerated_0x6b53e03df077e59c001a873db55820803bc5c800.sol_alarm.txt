Output:
- ID uniqueness violation: The transactionCount variable is used as the ID for transactions, but it does not guarantee uniqueness. If transactions are added or removed independently, the transaction ID may not be unique.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The transactions mapping is public, allowing anyone to view all transactions. This could potentially expose sensitive information.
- Inconsistent state update: The executeTransaction function updates the executed status of the transaction directly in the storage without any additional checks or safeguards, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if the transaction execution fails at some point.
