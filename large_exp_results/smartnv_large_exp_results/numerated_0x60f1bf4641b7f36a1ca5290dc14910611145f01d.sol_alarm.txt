The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the state variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and the functions `getStartingBalance()` and `votedProposal()`. It is important to clearly define the visibility of state variables and functions to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation.

2) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the `startExecute()` function to be called by any external account, potentially leading to unauthorized execution of proposals.

3) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly incremented in the `execute()` function without proper validation or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates and inaccurate voting results.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may fail if the execution of its require statements consumes all available gas, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
