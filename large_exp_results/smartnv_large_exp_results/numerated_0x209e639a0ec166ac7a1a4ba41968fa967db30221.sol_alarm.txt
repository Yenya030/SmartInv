The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public, which can expose sensitive information about the contract owner.
2) Inconsistent state update: The tokensSold variable is updated after transferring tokens to the buyer, which can lead to inconsistent state if the transfer fails.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check to prevent integer overflow when updating tokensSold variable with _numTokens.
4) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility that the transfer of tokens in buyTokens function may run out of gas if the number of tokens transferred is too high.
5) Privilege escalation: The constructor function does not include any access control for setting owner, leaving it open to privilege escalation attacks.
