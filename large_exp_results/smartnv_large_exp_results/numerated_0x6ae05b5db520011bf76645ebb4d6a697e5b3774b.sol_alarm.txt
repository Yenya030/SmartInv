The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables "votingToken" and "proposal" which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the contract may become inconsistent if multiple execution transactions are initiated concurrently, as the "proposal" state is being modified without proper synchronization.
3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may fail if the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of the required transactions, resulting in incomplete execution.
4) Atomicity violation: The execution of multiple functions (startExecute, execute, endExecute) may not be atomic, leading to unexpected behavior if an error occurs in between the function calls.
