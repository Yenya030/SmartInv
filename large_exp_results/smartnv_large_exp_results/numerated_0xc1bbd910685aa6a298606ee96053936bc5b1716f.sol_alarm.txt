The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas limits for its functions, which can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership of its functions and variables, which can lead to unauthorized access and changes by external entities.

3) inconsistent state update: The contract updates its state variables in different functions without proper consistency checks, which can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.

4) atomicity violation: The contract does not use locking mechanisms or atomic operations to ensure the atomicity of its state updates, which can lead to race condition vulnerabilities.

5) ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transfers securely, which can lead to vulnerabilities related to lost or leaked Ether.
