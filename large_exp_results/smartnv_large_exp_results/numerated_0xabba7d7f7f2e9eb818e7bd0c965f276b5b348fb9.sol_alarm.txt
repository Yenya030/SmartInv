The contract to analyze is as follows:

```solidity
contract Payment {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance = 0;
    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        balance += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow in the `deposit` function.
2) Insufficient gas in the `withdraw` function.
3) Inconsistent state update in the `withdraw` function.
