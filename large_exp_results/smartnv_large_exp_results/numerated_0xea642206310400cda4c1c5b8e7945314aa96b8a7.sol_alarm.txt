The potential vulnerabilities in the MultiSigWallet contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `submitTransaction` and `executeTransaction` functions should ideally only be accessed by authorized owners, but there is no check to ensure that `to` address is an owner or has the authority to execute transactions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `balances` mapping is directly modified within the `submitTransaction` and `executeTransaction` functions without proper checks or safeguards, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or unauthorized changes in the balances.
3) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of the `submitTransaction` or `executeTransaction` functions, it may result in the functions being left incomplete, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
