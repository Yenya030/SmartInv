The contract you provided has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas:
   - The function `endExecute` checks the balance of `votingToken` against the total supply, which could lead to running out of gas if the total supply is large.

Please note that the contract does not contain vulnerabilities such as price manipulation, privilege escalation, business logic flaw, atomicity violation, cross-bridge inconsistency, ID uniqueness violation, reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, arithmetic flaw, suicidal contracts, ether leakage, or incorrect visibility/ownership.
