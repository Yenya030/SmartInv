The contract above contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not specify visibility or ownership for the internal `owner` variable, which could lead to potential security issues.

2) Inconsistent State Update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented in the `execute` function without using the `SafeMath` library to prevent overflows or underflows, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient Gas: The `execute` function might require more gas than the Ethereum block gas limit allows, potentially causing execution to fail.

4) Business Logic Flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` in the `endExecute` function might not accurately reflect the intended business logic, leading to unintended consequences.

5) ID Uniqueness Violation: There is a lack of verifying ID uniqueness for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or overriding existing data unintentionally.

6) Atomicity Violation: The operations within the `startExecute` and `endExecute` functions are not performed atomically, meaning that an external actor could interfere with the process in between the execution steps.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, business logic flaw, ID uniqueness violation, and atomicity violation.
