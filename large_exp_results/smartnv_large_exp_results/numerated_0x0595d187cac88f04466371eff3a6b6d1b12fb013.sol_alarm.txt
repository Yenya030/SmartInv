The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without properly synchronizing with other functions that may rely on this value.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBlance` variable in the `startExecute` function is not properly scoped, potentially leading to unintended behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute all the required operations, especially the `require` statement checking the balance.
4) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function may suffer from arithmetic flaws when determining the liquidation condition.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that the `proposal.addr` in the `TimelockController` contract is unique, potentially leading to duplicate entries.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
4) Arithmetic flaw
5) ID uniqueness violation
