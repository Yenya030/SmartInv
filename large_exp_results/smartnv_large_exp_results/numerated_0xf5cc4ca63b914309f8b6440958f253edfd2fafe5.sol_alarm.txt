The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= 100, "exceeds maximum amount");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawTokens() public {
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "not the owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Output:
1) There is a potential vulnerability of privilege escalation in the transferOwnership function since anyone can call this function and become the new owner.
2) There is a potential vulnerability of inconsistent state update in the buyTokens function as the balances are directly modified without proper validation or synchronization.
3) There is a potential vulnerability of improper input validation in the buyTokens function as there is a hardcoded upper limit on the amount without considering other factors.
4) There is a potential vulnerability of incorrect visibility/ownership in the transferOwnership function as anyone can change the owner without proper authorization.
