The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

contract TokenSwap {
        IERC20 public token1;
        IERC20 public token2;
        uint public ratio;

        function swapTokens(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
            require(amount1 > 0 && amount2 > 0, "Invalid swap amounts");
            token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
            token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
            ratio = amount1 / amount2;
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow
2) Insufficient gas
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
