The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The function `liquidate` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract may have a business logic flaw as the liquidation condition `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount` could be incorrect or manipulated.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables in the `TimelockController` contract are not explicitly defined with a visibility modifier, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.
