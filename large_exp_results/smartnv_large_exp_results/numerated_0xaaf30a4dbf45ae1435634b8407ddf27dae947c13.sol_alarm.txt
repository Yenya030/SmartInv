The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect ownership checks in depositFunds(), releaseFunds(), and refundFunds(), which can lead to privilege escalation.
2) Lack of validation or checks for edge cases, leading to potential business logic flaws.
3) The use of address.transfer() without ensuring proper gas estimation, which can lead to insufficient gas vulnerabilities.
