Contract Analysis: 

The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities identified in the provided contract:

1) In the function `execute(uint256 amount)`, there is a possibility of `reentrancy vulnerability` as the function calls external functions before updating the state variable `proposal.votedAmount`.

2) Additionally, in the function `endExecute()`, there might be a `business logic flaw` as the condition for checking the execution success (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) may not be sufficient to ensure the integrity of the execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are `reentrancy vulnerability` and `business logic flaw`.
