This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) atomicity violation: In the execute function, multiple state changes are made before the votedProposal function is called. If an error occurs after some state changes, the contract may be left in an inconsistent state. It is advisable to perform all state changes at the end, once all checks have passed.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not contain all the necessary functions to fully comply with the interface. Make sure all required functions are properly implemented and have the correct visibility.

3) inconsistent state update: In the endExecute function, the condition checking if the execution failed is based on the balance comparison, which may lead to an inconsistent state if the condition is not properly calculated. Ensure that the state changes are updated correctly based on accurate data.

4) ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether explicitly, but if it interacts with other contracts that handle ether, there may be potential risks of ether leakage if not properly handled.

5) insufficient gas: Depending on the gas consumption of the functions, there may be a risk of running out of gas during execution, especially in functions like endExecute that perform multiple operations. Ensure that enough gas is provided for the contract functions to prevent premature termination.
