The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring atomicity or proper handling of state changes.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `debt` and `collateral` mappings in the `ExchangeTokens` contract are public, which exposes sensitive user data to the public.

Please note that the `ExchangeTokens` contract is healthy and does not contain vulnerabilities.
