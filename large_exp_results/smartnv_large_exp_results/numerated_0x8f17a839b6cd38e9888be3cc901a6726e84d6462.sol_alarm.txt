This contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent State Update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `proposal` struct but does not persist this change outside of the function, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The `proposal` struct is being accessed directly in the functions, which could expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access.
3) Insufficient Gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the required operations, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
