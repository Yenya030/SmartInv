Contract TimelockController contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that the `proposal.sTime` and `proposal.votedAmount` conditions are properly met.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but it does not define the required functions resulting in incorrect visibility/ownership of the functions specified in the interface.
