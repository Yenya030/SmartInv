The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Lottery {
    mapping(address => uint) public playerTickets;
    uint public totalTickets;
    address public winner;
    
    function buyTickets(uint numTickets) external {
        require(numTickets > 0, "Must buy at least 1 ticket");
        playerTickets[msg.sender] += numTickets;
        totalTickets += numTickets;
    }
    
    function drawWinner() external {
        require(totalTickets > 0, "No tickets bought");
        
        uint winningTicket = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender, totalTickets))) % totalTickets + 1;
        
        address winnerAddress;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalTickets; i++) {
            if (winningTicket <= playerTickets[msg.sender]) {
                winnerAddress = msg.sender;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        winner = winnerAddress;
    }
    
    function claimPrize() external {
        require(msg.sender == winner, "You are not the winner");
        // transfer prize to winner
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
5) atomicity violation - The `drawWinner` function does not guarantee atomicity for generating the winning ticket, which may enable race conditions.
7) ID uniqueness violation - The `drawWinner` function selects a winner based on comparing tickets per sender, which may not ensure unique identification.
10) arithmetic flaw - The calculation of `winningTicket` in the `drawWinner` function may suffer from an arithmetic flaw due to modulus operation applied to `totalTickets`.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership - The `winner` variable being public allows any external entity to access the winner, which might not be intended and expose sensitive information.
