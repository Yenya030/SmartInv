The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted.");
        require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed.");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Loop in delegation is not allowed.");
        }

        sender.delegate = to;
        Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];
        if (delegateTo.voted) {
            voters[delegateTo.vote].weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint256 option) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted.");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = option;
        voters[option].weight += sender.weight;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
