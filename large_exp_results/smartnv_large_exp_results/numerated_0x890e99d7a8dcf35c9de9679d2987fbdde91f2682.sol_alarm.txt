Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) atomicity violation: The function execute() does multiple operations that should be executed atomically, such as transferring tokens and updating the votedAmount variable. 
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the variables proposal and startingBalanceList, which can potentially lead to unexpected behavior. 
3) inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal struct is updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state.
