The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the variable "lockedFunds" based on a condition without also updating the state of the "proposal" variable, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but doesn't define the required functions of the interface. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the interface functions are not implemented correctly or are not accessible.
3) Insufficient gas: The function "endExecute" performs a check on the balance of the contract which could consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to insufficient gas for the function to execute successfully.
