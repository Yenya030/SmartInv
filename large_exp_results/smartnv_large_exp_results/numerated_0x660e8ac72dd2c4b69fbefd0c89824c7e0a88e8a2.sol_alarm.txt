The contract in question potentially contains the following vulnerabilities:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract lacks proper checks to prevent potential integer overflow or underflow in the functions that involve arithmetic operations with uint variables. 
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have issues with inconsistent state updates due to the lack of synchronized state changes, especially in functions like 'execute' and 'endExecute'. 
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define visibility and ownership for certain variables and functions, which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical contract components.
