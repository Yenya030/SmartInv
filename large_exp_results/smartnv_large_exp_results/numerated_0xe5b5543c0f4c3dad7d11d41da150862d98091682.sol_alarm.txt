Contract Analysis: 

The contract provided for analysis contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute()` function updates the `proposal` state without ensuring that previous proposals have been finalized or handled properly. This can lead to inconsistent data and potential manipulation.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is declared without a visibility specifier, making it publicly accessible. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposal data.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a potential risk of running out of gas when executing transactions, especially in the `execute()` function where multiple operations are performed. This can result in failed transactions and incomplete execution.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
