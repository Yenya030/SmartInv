The contract to analyze is:

contract Storage {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for an integer overflow in the 'deposit' function if a large amount of value is deposited, causing the balance to wrap around.
2) Ether leakage: The 'withdraw' function may be susceptible to ether leakage if the transfer fails after reducing the user's balance, leading to loss of funds.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'withdraw' function relies on an external call that may consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas exceptions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'balances' mapping being public exposes all user balances publicly, which may not be desirable in terms of privacy and security.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Ether leakage
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
