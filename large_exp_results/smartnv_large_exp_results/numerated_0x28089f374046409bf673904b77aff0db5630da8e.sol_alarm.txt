The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) business logic flaw: The function `endExecute()` may have a logic flaw as the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` could potentially lead to inconsistent state update or unexpected behavior.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contracts lack visibility modifiers (e.g., public, internal, private) for the state variables and functions which may result in incorrect access control and ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw and incorrect visibility/ownership.
