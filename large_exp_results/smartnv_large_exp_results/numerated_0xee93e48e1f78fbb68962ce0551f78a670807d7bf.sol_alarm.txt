The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during transactions due to the lack of gas stipulation in functions.
2) Ether leakage: There is a potential for losing ether due to malicious or erroneous transfers.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The lack of access control mechanisms may expose the contract to unauthorized access or manipulation.
