Potential vulnerabilities in the Lotto contract:
- Incorrect ticket price vulnerability
- Only owner can select winner privilege escalation vulnerability
- Missing logic for selecting winner, possibly leading to a business logic flaw
- Lack of integer overflow/underflow checks in buyTicket function
