Here are the potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation - There is no check to ensure that a voter cannot vote multiple times for different proposals, potentially skewing the results.
2) Inconsistent state update - The state of the voters hasVoted status and votedProposalId is updated without atomicity checks, which could lead to inconsistent data.
3) Business logic flaw - There is no validation for the voter's eligibility or the validity of the proposal, allowing incorrect or unauthorized votes to be cast.
4) Insufficient gas - If there are a large number of voters or proposals, the gas limit may be exceeded, causing transaction failures.
