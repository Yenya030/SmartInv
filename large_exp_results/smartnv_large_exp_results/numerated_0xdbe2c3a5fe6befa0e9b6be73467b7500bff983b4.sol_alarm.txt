Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute sets the startingBalanceList for a proposal.addr, but the startingBlance variable is misspelled and not used correctly. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20, but it doesn't have the required functions of the interface. This could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
