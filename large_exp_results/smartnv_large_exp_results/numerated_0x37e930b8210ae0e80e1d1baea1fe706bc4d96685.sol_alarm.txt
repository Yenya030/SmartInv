This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Integrity Pact Violation: The function `calculatePrice` may be susceptible to price manipulation as the price is calculated based on the balance of USDC and WETH in the Uniswap pair.
3) Business Logic Flaw: The `liquidate` function may have a business logic flaw as it transfers tokens without checking if the user actually has sufficient balance or if the conditions for liquidation are met.
