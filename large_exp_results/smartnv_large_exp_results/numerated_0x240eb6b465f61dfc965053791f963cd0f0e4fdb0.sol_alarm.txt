Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function modifies the state variable `proposal.votedAmount`, but it does not use a proper synchronization mechanism to ensure that this state update is done atomically.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as private, which may expose sensitive data to external contract interactions.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a significant amount of gas to execute, potentially leading to out-of-gas exceptions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposals, which could potentially lead to issues related to duplicate proposals or confusion in tracking different proposals.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are several arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow, such as in the calculation of `startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr)` or `proposal.votedAmount += amount`.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions correctly, which could lead to ether being locked in the contract indefinitely or being lost by sending it to unintended addresses.

7) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from executing certain functions or accessing sensitive data.
