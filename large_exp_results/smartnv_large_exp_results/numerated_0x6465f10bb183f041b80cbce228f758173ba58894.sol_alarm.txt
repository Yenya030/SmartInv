The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization or atomicity considerations, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation by external contracts or actors.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs multiple operations that consume gas, including token transfers and balance checks, which can potentially exceed the gas limit and result in transaction failures.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
