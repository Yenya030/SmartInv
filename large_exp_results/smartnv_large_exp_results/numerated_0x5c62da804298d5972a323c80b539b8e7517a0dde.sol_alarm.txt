The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates `lockedFunds` without any proper mechanism to ensure consistency with the rest of the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is used without explicitly specifying the visibility, which may lead to ownership concerns.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set by the user, certain operations in the contract may fail due to insufficient gas provided, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
