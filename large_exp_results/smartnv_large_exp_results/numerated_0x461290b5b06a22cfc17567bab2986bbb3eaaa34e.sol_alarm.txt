Contract you are going to analyze:
contract PaymentContract {
    address public owner;
    uint256 public totalAmount;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
        _;
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) public payable {
        totalAmount += amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
        owner.transfer(totalAmount);
        totalAmount = 0;
    }
} 

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- privilege escalation (lack of proper access control for owner)
- inconsistent state update (totalAmount update without proper checks)
- atomicity violation (totalAmount can be manipulated externally)
- ether leakage (transfer of ether to owner without proper error handling)
- incorrect visibility/ownership (owner visibility and usage)
