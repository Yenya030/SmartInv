The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract VotingSystem {
         struct Voter {
             uint votingPower;
             bool hasVoted;
         }
         mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
         mapping(address => bool) public voted;
         
         uint public totalVotes;
         
         function vote() public {
             require(voters[msg.sender].votingPower > 0, "You have no voting power");
             require(!voters[msg.sender].hasVoted, "You have already voted");
             
             voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = true;
             totalVotes++;
         }
         
         function delegate(address to) public {
             require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed");
             require(voters[to].votingPower > 0, "Delegatee has no voting power");
             require(!voters[msg.sender].hasVoted, "You have already voted");
             
             voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = true;
             totalVotes++;
         }
}

Output: 
1) The contract contains inconsistencies in state updates. 
2) The contract lacks checks for voter uniqueness, potentially leading to ID uniqueness violation.
