Contract to analyze:
```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
     mapping (address => bool) public hasVoted;
     mapping (address => uint) public voteCount;
     uint public totalVotes;

     function vote(uint _proposalId) public {
          require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
          voteCount[msg.sender] = _proposalId;
          hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
          totalVotes++;
     }

     function getTotalVotes() public view returns (uint) {
          return totalVotes;
     }
}
```

Output:
- Correctness: healthy
