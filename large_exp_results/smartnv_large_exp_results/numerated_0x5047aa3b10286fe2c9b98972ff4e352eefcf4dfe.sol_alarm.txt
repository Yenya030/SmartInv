Contract:

contract VotingSystem {
    uint public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function resetVotes() public {
        totalVotes = 0;
        for (address voter : voters) {
            hasVoted[voter] = false;
        }
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
7) ID uniqueness violation
11) suicidal contracts
