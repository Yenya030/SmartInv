The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has an issue where the proposal's `votedAmount` is directly manipulated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or validation, which can lead to inconsistent data state.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the `execution failed` condition is met, leading to a potential vulnerability.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are not explicitly defined with access control modifiers, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modification.
