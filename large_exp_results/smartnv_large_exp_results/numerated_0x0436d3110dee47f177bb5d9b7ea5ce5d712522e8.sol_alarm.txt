Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals. This could lead to potential issues if multiple proposals have the same ID.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates in the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute that could potentially lead to inconsistent states within the contract.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is set to internal, which may not provide the necessary security or control over the owner of the contract.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state updates, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
