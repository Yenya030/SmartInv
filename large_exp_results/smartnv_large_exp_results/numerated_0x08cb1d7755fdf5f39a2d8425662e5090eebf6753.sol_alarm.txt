Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without proper synchronization.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is declared within the contract without specifying visibility, potentially leading to unwanted access.
3) Reentrancy: The `votingToken.transferFrom` function call in the `execute` function could allow reentrancy attacks.
