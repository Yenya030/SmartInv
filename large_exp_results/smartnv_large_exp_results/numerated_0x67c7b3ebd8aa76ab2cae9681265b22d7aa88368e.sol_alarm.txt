The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract does not check for the user's debt and collateral amounts correctly before executing the liquidation.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract could potentially result in an arithmetic flaw if the division operation results in an overflow or underflow situation.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw and arithmetic flaw.
