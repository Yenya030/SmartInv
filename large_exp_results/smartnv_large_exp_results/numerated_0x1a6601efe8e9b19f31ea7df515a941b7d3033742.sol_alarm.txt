The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization between potential concurrent calls, leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `debt` and `collateral` mapping should be marked as private to prevent external access, as they are intended for internal use only.
