Contract analyzed:

contract VotingContract {
    struct Vote {
        address voter;
        bool inSupport;
    }
    
    mapping(address => bool) public voted;
    mapping(uint => Vote) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;
    
    function vote(bool inSupport) public {
        require(!voted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        votes[totalVotes] = Vote(msg.sender, inSupport);
        voted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }
    
    function getVoteCount() public view returns (uint) {
        return totalVotes;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
- ID uniqueness violation: The totalVotes variable is used as an index to store votes in the votes mapping, but it's not guaranteed to be unique, which can lead to overwriting existing votes.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The voted mapping is public, allowing anyone to see if a specific address has voted, which can lead to privacy concerns.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not implement gas mitigation strategies, which can lead to out of gas errors during execution.
