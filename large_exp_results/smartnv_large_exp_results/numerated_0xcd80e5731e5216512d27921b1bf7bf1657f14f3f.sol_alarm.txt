The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Privilege escalation: The `setTokenPrice` function allows anyone to set the token price if they call this function, instead of just the owner.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `buyTokens` function does not update the state of the contract after transferring tokens, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as public, exposing it to everyone and potentially violating the principle of ownership privacy.
