The contract to analyze:

contract Escrow {
   uint public balance;
   address public owner;
   address public buyer;
   
   constructor(address _buyer) {
      owner = msg.sender;
      buyer = _buyer;
   }
   
   function deposit() public payable {
      require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit funds");
      balance += msg.value;
   }
   
   function withdraw() public {
      require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
      uint amount = balance;
      balance = 0;
      owner.transfer(amount);
   }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
2) privilege escalation
