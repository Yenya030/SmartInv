This contract may have the following vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as the condition for liquidation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount) may not accurately reflect the intended logic for liquidation.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables debt, collateral, and functions such as liquidate and calculatePrice in the ExchangeTokens contract are set to public which may expose sensitive information or functionalities to unauthorized access. 

To summarize, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw and incorrect visibility/ownership.
