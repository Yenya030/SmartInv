Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function is updating `proposal.votedAmount` without verifying if the caller has the authority to do so, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which may expose the contract to unauthorized access or manipulation of the token.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas stipend considerations, which might lead to the contract being unable to perform certain operations due to insufficient gas.
4) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function may not accurately represent the intended business logic, leading to incorrect outcomes.
