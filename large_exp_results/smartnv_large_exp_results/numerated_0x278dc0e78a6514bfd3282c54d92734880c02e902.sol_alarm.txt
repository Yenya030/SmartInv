Contract TokenSale {
    address public admin;
    IERC20 public token;

    constructor(IERC20 _token) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint256 amount) external {
        require(msg.value >= amount, "Insufficient payment");
        uint256 tokensToTransfer = amount * getPrice();
        token.transfer(msg.sender, tokensToTransfer);
    }

    function getPrice() public view returns(uint256) {
        // external price oracle function call here
    }
} 

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
4) inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the state of the contract after transferring tokens to the buyer, which can lead to an inconsistent state.
5) atomicity violation: The calculation of tokens to transfer is not atomic, as it involves multiple operations, which can lead to race conditions.
13) insufficient gas: The buyTokens function may fail due to insufficient gas if the amount of tokens to transfer is large, causing the transaction to revert.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is declared as public, potentially exposing sensitive information about the contract owner.
