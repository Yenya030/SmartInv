The provided contract has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) atomicity violation: Since the operations in the `endExecute` function involve multiple state changes (e.g., checking balance, comparing balances), there is a potential for inconsistent state update if these operations are not executed atomically.

2) inconsistent state update: There is a potential risk of inconsistent state update in the `execute` function, specifically with the `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` line. If multiple executions of this function happen simultaneously, it could lead to incorrect state updates.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The access control for functions in the contract is not explicitly defined, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
