The contract provided for analysis is:

contract MyToken {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer underflow in the withdraw function if the amount exceeds the balance of the sender.
2) Insufficient gas: Transfer of funds in the withdraw function may fail due to out of gas issue, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
