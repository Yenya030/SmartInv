Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing any address to call functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute without proper authorization.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables like proposal, startingBlance, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds, which could lead to potential visibility or ownership issues.
