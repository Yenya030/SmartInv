Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has variables like `proposal.votedAmount` and `lockedFunds` that are modified in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than available in some cases, resulting in the function failing to execute entirely.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if access control is not properly managed.
