Contract TimelockController is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without any check on the validity or authentication of the caller. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if unauthorized parties are able to call this function.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal which might expose it to unauthorized access or manipulation by external contracts.

Contract ExchangeTokens is healthy and does not contain any identified vulnerabilities.
