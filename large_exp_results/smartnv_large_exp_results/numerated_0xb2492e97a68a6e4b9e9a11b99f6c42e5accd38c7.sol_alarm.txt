The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions and variables in the contract are not explicitly defined with visibility modifiers like public, private, internal, or external. This could lead to unexpected access control issues.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract directly updates state variables without proper checks or validation, which can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistent state.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas optimization in the contract, which may result in functions failing due to running out of gas.

4) Arithmetic flaw: There is a risk of arithmetic flaws in the contract, specifically in the function calculatePrice(), where mathematical operations are performed without proper overflow/underflow checks.

5) Ether leakage: The contract lacks explicit mechanisms to handle ether transactions, which could result in ether leakage or unintended transfers.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, arithmetic flaw, and ether leakage.
