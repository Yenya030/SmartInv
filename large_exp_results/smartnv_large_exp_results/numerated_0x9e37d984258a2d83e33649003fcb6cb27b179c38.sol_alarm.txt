The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute()` function is updated based on the balance of the contract without verifying if all necessary conditions are met. This could lead to an inconsistent state update vulnerability.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, making it public by default. It is advisable to explicitly define the visibility of variables to prevent unintended access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
