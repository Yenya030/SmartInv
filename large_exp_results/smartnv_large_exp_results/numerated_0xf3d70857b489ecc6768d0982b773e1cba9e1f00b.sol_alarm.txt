Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not update `proposal.sTime` after execution, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, but it is not clear how it is being used or managed within the contract, which may lead to ownership issues.
3) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute` function checking if the execution has failed based on the balance of the contract compared to the total supply of the token may not accurately reflect the success or failure of the execution.
