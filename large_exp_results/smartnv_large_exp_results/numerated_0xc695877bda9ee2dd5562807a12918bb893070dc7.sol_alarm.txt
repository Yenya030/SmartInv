The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: In the function endExecute, the line "lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));" updates the state variable lockedFunds without ensuring proper authorization or validation.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the function liquidate, the line "require(getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount," may result in an arithmetic flaw if the calculation leads to unexpected results due to integer division and multiplication.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Arithmetic flaw
