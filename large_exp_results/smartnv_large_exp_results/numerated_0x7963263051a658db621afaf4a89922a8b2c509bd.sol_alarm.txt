Contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation");
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
        Voter storage delegate_ = voters[to];

        if (delegate_.voted) {
            // Sender weight added to the delegate
            delegate_.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint option) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted");

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = option;
        // update option vote count
    }

    function getVoteCount(uint option) public view returns (uint) {
        // return the count of votes for a specific option
    }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
