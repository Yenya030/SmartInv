Contract Analysis:
The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw where the condition for liquidation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount) might not correctly determine if a user's funds can be liquidated.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract is set to public, which might not be necessary and could pose a security risk.
3) Insufficient gas: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract transfers tokens between addresses, which may require more gas than expected, potentially leading to execution failures.
