For the analyzed contract:
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) An incorrect visibility issue as the voters mapping is public, exposing sensitive voter information.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that a single address can vote only once.
3) Inconsistent state update: The winningProposal and winningVoteCount may not be updated consistently when multiple voters with different weights vote simultaneously.
