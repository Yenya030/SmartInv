The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have an inconsistent state update issue due to the manipulation of the `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `startingBalanceList` variables are used without explicit visibility specifier, which may lead to incorrect visibility issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
