The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract and the visibility of certain functions and variables are not specified explicitly.
2) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of explicit atomicity when updating the state variables in functions like `execute()` where multiple state changes are made without using a locking mechanism.
3) Inconsistent state update: The state variables like `proposal.votedAmount` are updated without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
4) Ether leakage: There is no explicit handling of Ether transactions in the contract, which could lead to unintended Ether leakage.
5) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract may require more gas than specified, leading to potential out-of-gas errors during contract execution.
