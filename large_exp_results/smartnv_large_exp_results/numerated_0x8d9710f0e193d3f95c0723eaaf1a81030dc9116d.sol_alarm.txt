The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not specified with a specific visibility (e.g. private), which could lead to potential issues with ownership control.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without considering potential race conditions or other update inconsistencies.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may run out of gas if the execution of the require statement consumes too much gas, resulting in a failed execution.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is potential for integer overflow in the endExecute function when calculating votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The debt and collateral mappings in the contract are public, potentially exposing sensitive information to external parties.
