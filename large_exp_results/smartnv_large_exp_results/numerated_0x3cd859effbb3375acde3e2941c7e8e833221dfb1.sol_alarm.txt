Vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not specify any access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the functions and potentially manipulate the proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state updates in the execute function as the votedAmount of the proposal is updated after the transfer of the tokens, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include any mechanisms to prevent the self-destruct function, which can lead to the contract being destroyed unexpectedly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and suicidal contracts.
