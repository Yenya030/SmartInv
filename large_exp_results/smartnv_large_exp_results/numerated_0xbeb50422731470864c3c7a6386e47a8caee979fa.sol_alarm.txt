The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Marketplace {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint => Product) public products;

    struct Product {
        uint id;
        string name;
        uint price;
        uint inventory;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    function addProduct(uint _id, string memory _name, uint _price, uint _inventory) public onlyOwner {
        products[_id] = Product(_id, _name, _price, _inventory);
    }

    function purchaseProduct(uint _id, uint _quantity) public payable {
        require(products[_id].inventory >= _quantity, "Insufficient inventory");
        require(msg.value >= products[_id].price * _quantity, "Insufficient payment");

        products[_id].inventory -= _quantity;
        address(owner).transfer(msg.value);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is declared as public, allowing anyone to see who the owner is.
2) Insufficient gas - If the gas provided by a user for a transaction is not enough to cover the computation cost, the transaction might fail.
3) Suicidal contracts - The contract does not have any self-destruct mechanism, but if added later without proper checks, it could lead to a suicidal contract vulnerability.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- Suicidal contracts
