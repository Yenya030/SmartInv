This contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The interfaces (IERC20, IUniswapV2Pair) used in the contract are not provided, which could lead to incorrect functionality or ownership concerns.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated based on the balance of the contract, which may result in inconsistent state if the contract interacts with other contracts or external factors during execution.
