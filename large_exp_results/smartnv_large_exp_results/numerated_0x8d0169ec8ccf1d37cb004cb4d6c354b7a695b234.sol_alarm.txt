Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct in the contract is not specified with any visibility modifier, making it publicly accessible.
- Inconsistent state update: In the 'startExecute' function, the 'startingBalanceList' mapping is updated without initializing it or ensuring consistency with other data structures.
- Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may fail due to running out of gas if the 'lockedFunds' update requires a large amount of gas to execute.
- ID uniqueness violation: The 'proposal' struct does not have any unique identifier specified, which could potentially lead to conflicts or errors in tracking proposals.
- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions explicitly, which could lead to unintended ether transfers or losses.
