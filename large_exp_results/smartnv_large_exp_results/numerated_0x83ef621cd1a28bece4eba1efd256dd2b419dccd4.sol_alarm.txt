Given the contract provided for analysis:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid not high enough");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
3) business logic flaw
5) atomicity violation
8) reentrancy
10) arithmetic flaw
