The contract you provided:

```solidity
contract SupplyChain {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint => Product) public products;
    uint public productCount;

    struct Product {
        uint productId;
        string name;
        uint price;
        address owner;
        bool isSold;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        productCount = 0;
    }

    function addProduct(string memory _name, uint _price) public {
        productCount++;
        products[productCount] = Product(productCount, _name, _price, msg.sender, false);
    }

    function purchaseProduct(uint _productId) public payable {
        Product storage product = products[_productId];
        require(msg.value == product.price, "Insufficient funds");
        require(product.isSold == false, "Product already sold");
        product.owner = msg.sender;
        product.isSold = true;
        payable(owner).transfer(msg.value);
        payable(product.owner).transfer(msg.value*9/10);
    }
}
```

Output:
1) Arithmetic flaw: The multiplication operation in `purchaseProduct` function may result in arithmetic overflow/underflow if the values involved are not properly validated.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `public`, which exposes it to potential manipulation. Consider changing the visibility to `private` and providing a function to access it if necessary.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
