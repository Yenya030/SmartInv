The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

4) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable, but it does not reset or clear the `proposal` struct, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

5) Atomicity violation: The `startExecute` function sets the `proposal` struct fields separately without using a locking mechanism, which can lead to race conditions and atomicity violations.

12) Ether leakage: The contract handles ERC20 tokens but does not have any mechanisms to handle Ether transactions, potentially leading to Ether leakage vulnerabilities.
