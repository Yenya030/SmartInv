The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract includes functions that update proposal state variables separately (such as `proposal` and `votedAmount`), which could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which could lead to potential visibility issues and unintended access to its data.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks the balance of the contract and total token supply in one require statement, which may consume a large amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

4) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms that restrict certain functions to only be executed by authorized users, potentially allowing privilege escalation attacks.
