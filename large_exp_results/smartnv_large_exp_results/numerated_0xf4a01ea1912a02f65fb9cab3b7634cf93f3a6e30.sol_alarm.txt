The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring atomicity or consistency of the state update, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate` function of the contract, there is a potential arithmetic flaw where the calculation for liquidation may not correctly handle large values, leading to unexpected outcomes.
