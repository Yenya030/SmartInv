The contract to analyze:

contract PaymentGateway {
    uint public totalAmount;
    address public owner;

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can deposit funds");
        totalAmount += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
        require(totalAmount >= amount, "Insufficient funds");
        totalAmount -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentGateway contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
