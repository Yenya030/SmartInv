Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are not specified with a visibility keyword, making them publicly accessible. This can lead to manipulation of these variables by unauthorized users.
- Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any checks on the state of the contract or proper validation, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
