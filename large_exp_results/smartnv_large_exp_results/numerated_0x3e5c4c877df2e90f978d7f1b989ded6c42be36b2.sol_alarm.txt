The potential vulnerabilities in the contract at the end are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract doesn't update the state of any variables inside the functions, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility (public, internal, private) for variables and functions, making it difficult to determine who can access or modify them.
