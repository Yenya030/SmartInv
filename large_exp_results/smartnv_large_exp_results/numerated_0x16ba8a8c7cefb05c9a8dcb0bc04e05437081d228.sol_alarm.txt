The potential vulnerabilities in the contract to be analyzed are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variables `lockedFunds` and `proposal.votedAmount` are updated without proper synchronization or checks, leading to possible inconsistencies in the state.

2) Atomicity violation: Multiple state changes are made within the `execute` function without proper atomicity guarantees, which could result in unexpected behavior if any of the operations fail in between.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables `lockedFunds` and `proposal`, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modifications.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculations involving `startingBlance` and `proposal.votedAmount` within the functions `startExecute` and `execute` could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider potential gas limitations for certain operations, such as looping over all balances in `endExecute`, which could lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

6) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function seems to have a logical flaw, possibly allowing for unexpected behavior or undesired outcomes.
