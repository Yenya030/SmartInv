The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not include the necessary ERC20 functions, such as transferFrom and balanceOf, which could lead to incorrect functionality and ownership control.

2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal" state variables are not consistently updated throughout the functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistency in the contract's state.

3) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total token supply for execution, which may not be a suitable business logic and could lead to unexpected results.

4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function does multiple balance checks and calculations, which may consume a significant amount of gas and could potentially lead to out-of-gas issues.

5) Atomicity violation: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute perform multiple operations that should ideally be executed atomically to avoid race conditions and inconsistent state updates.
