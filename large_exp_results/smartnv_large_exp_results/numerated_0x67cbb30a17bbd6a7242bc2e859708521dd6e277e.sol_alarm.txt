The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without initializing the `proposal` variable. This can lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behaviors.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function without specifying the visibility (public, internal, private). This can lead to potential issues related to variable access control and ownership.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a loop over the balance of the `votingToken`, which may consume a large amount of gas. If the contract does not have enough gas allocated, this can result in the function failing to execute properly.

4) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not contain any checks or mechanisms to prevent the contract from being self-destructed, which can lead to a potential suicidal contract vulnerability.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Insufficient gas, Suicidal contracts.
