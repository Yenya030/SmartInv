The contract below contains a potential vulnerability:

contract Auction {
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;
    address public highestBidder;
    address public owner;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "You are already the highest bidder");

        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function endAuction() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of the auction");

        owner.transfer(highestBid);
    }
}

Output:
- inconsistent state update
