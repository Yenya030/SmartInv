Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `lockedFunds` without using the `proposal` struct directly, which may result in inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The `votedProposal` function is not shown in the contract, but if it updates state variables without using appropriate synchronization mechanisms, it can lead to atomicity violations.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanisms to ensure uniqueness of `proposal` IDs, which can lead to ID duplication issues.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It's not clear if the `votingToken` variable is publicly accessible or if the ownership of the contract is properly managed, potentially leading to unauthorized access or ownership control.
