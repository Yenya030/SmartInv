Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `startingBalanceList` is being updated in the `startExecute` function but is not defined or initialized in the contract. This could lead to inconsistent state updates or unexpected behavior.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function but not defined in the contract. If this function includes updating or managing unique identifiers, there could be a risk of ID uniqueness violation.
