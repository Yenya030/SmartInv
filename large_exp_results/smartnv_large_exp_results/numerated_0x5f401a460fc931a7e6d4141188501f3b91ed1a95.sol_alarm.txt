This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if it is already set, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute()` function is updated without any consideration for ID uniqueness, which could lead to conflicts or incorrect data.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility for external interaction.
