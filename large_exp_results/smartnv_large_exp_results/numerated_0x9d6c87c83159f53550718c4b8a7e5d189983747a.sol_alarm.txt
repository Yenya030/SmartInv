Contract:

contract Lottery {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public players;
    uint public totalPlayers;
    uint public jackpot;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalPlayers = 0;
        jackpot = 0;
    }

    function buyTicket() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Value must be greater than 0");
        players[msg.sender] = true;
        totalPlayers++;
        jackpot += msg.value;
    }

    function selectWinner() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can select winner");
        require(totalPlayers > 0, "No players participated");

        address winner = getAddressFromHash(blockhash(block.number - 1));
        payable(winner).transfer(jackpot);

        totalPlayers = 0;
        jackpot = 0;
    }

    function getAddressFromHash(bytes32 hash) internal pure returns (address) {
        return address(uint160(uint256(hash)));
    }
}

Output: 

potential vulnerabilities:
- The jackpot is transferred to the winner address without any additional checks, which may lead to potential reentrancy attacks.
- The totalPlayers count is reset to 0 before transferring the jackpot, which may lead to inconsistent state update where the winner does not receive the correct amount.
- There is a lack of check for integer overflow when adding to the jackpot, which could be exploited for an integer overflow attack.
