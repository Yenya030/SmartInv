Potential vulnerabilities:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `owner` variable, which can lead to potential ownership-related vulnerabilities.
2) inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in the `startExecute()` function without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) atomicity violation: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented in the `execute()` function without proper atomicity checks, which can lead to race condition vulnerabilities.
4) insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function performs a potentially expensive operation by checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may consume excessive gas and lead to out-of-gas errors.

Overall, the contract may need further analysis and refinement to eliminate these potential vulnerabilities.
