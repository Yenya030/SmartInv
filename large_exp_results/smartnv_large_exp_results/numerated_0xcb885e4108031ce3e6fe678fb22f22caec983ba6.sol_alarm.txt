potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without using proper synchronization techniques, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define the required functions, which can lead to visibility or ownership issues.
