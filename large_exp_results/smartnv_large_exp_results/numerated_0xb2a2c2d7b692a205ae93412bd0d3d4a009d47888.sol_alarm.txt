Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the same proposal is not executed multiple times or that the total voted amount doesn't exceed a certain limit.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are not specified with appropriate visibility (such as private or internal), potentially exposing them to external manipulation.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes (transferring tokens, updating `proposal.votedAmount`), which could lead to atomicity violations if not properly handled.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas during token transfer operations if the gas limit is not high enough, leading to a failed execution.
