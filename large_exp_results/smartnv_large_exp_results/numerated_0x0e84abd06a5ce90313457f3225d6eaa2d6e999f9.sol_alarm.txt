The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any check, which may lead to an inconsistent state if the conditions are not met.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide any of the required functions, which could lead to ownership issues or visibility problems.
3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks the balance of the contract but does not consider the gas cost, potentially leading to insufficient gas for execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
