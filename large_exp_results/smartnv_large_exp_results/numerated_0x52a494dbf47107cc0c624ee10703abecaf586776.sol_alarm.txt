<\example_1\> 
1) atomicity violation: the updates to proposal.votedAmount in the execute function are not done atomically, which could lead to inconsistent data state.
2) inconsistent state update: the proposal struct is updated in startExecute and execute functions but not consistently updated in a safe and predictable manner.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: the owner variable is declared as internal, which may lead to ownership-related vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

<\example_2\> 
1) price manipulation: the liquidate function relies on the getPrice function, which may not always provide accurate or reliable pricing information, opening up the possibility for price manipulation vulnerabilities. 
2) integer overflow/underflow: there may be potential for integer overflow or underflow in the calculation of amounts in the liquidate function, depending on the values of cAmount and dAmount.
3) insufficient gas: if the liquidate function requires substantial gas for execution, there may be concerns around gas limits and potential for running out of gas during the function execution.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: the debt and collateral mappings are declared as public, potentially exposing sensitive information to external actors. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, price manipulation, integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas.
