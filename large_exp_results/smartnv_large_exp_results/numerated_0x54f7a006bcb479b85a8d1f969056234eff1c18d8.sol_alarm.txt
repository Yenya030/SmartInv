The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any further processing or logic, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow: The calculation in the `liquidate()` function involves multiplication which can potentially result in an integer overflow if the values involved are not properly validated.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables `debt` and `collateral` are declared as public, which can expose sensitive information to external entities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
