Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract may allow unauthorized users to start or end executions, manipulate proposals, or vote on proposals.

2) Inconsistent state update: There may be issues with updating state variables such as votedAmount and proposals in different functions, leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

3) Atomicity violation: The execution of multiple operations within functions like execute() may not be atomic, potentially leading to race conditions or undesired outcomes.

4) Ether leakage: There is no explicit handling of Ether transactions, which could lead to Ether being trapped in the contract or unintended transfers.

5) Insufficient gas: If the execution of certain operations requires more gas than estimated, it could result in transaction failures or unexpected behavior.

6) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables may not be appropriately set, allowing for unintended access or manipulation.

7) Integer overflow/underflow: Operations involving integers may not be adequately checked for potential overflow or underflow risks.

8) Business logic flaw: The contract's logic for executing proposals, handling balances, or validating conditions may contain flaws or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

9) Cross bridge inconsistency: Interactions with external contracts, tokens, or systems may introduce inconsistencies or vulnerabilities that could impact the contract's functionality or security.
