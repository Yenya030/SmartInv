Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables "votingToken" and "proposal" which can lead to potential vulnerabilities related to access control.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the "execute" function, the state variable "proposal.votedAmount" is updated without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: If the "endExecute" function requires a large amount of gas to execute, there is a possibility of running out of gas and the execution failing.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can potentially lead to conflicts or errors.
5) Reentrancy: The contract is not protected against reentrancy attacks, leaving it vulnerable to potential exploits through recursive function calls.
6) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving arithmetic calculations in the contract that could potentially result in integer overflow/underflow issues.
7) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions or storage properly, leaving it vulnerable to potential Ether leakage.
