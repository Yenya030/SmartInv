The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update - The function `execute` in the contract doesn't ensure that the state is updated atomically, which can lead to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility of the internal variables `owner` and `votingToken` is not specified, which could potentially lead to unintended access and modification of these variables.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
