Contract to be analyzed:
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    address public admin;
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    
    function giveRightToVote(address _voter) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can give right to vote");
        voters[_voter].weight = 1;
    }
    
    function vote(uint256 _proposal) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "Only voters can vote");
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Voter has already voted");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = _proposal;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function winningProposal() public view returns (uint256 winningProposal_) {
        uint256[] memory voteCounts;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
            voteCounts[voters[i].vote]++;
        }
        
        uint256 winningVoteCount = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
            if (voteCounts[i] > winningVoteCount) {
                winningVoteCount = voteCounts[i];
                winningProposal_ = i;
            }
        }
    }

The potential vulnerabilities in the "VotingSystem" contract are:
1) inconsistent state update
2) integer overflow/underflow
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
