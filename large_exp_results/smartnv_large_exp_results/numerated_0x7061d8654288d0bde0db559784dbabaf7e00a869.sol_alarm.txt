The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not take into account any changes in balances that may occur after this check, leading to a potential inconsistency in state.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks if the contract has enough funds to execute, but it does not consider the gas costs involved in the transfer operation, which may lead to the function failing due to insufficient gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define all the necessary functions required by the interface, which can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership of certain functions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Insufficient gas, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
