The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable is not specified with a visibility modifier, making it public by default. It can pose a security risk if sensitive information is stored in the variable.

2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly in the execute function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Reentrancy: There are potential reentrancy vulnerabilities in the execute function where the implementation doesn't handle reentrancy issues with external calls.

4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a large amount of gas due to the loop over votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)), which can lead to out-of-gas errors.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculatePrice function calculates the ratio of balance, which might lead to integer overflow if the values are large.

6) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function uses a fixed formula to determine if a user's funds can be liquidated, which may not consider all scenarios accurately.
