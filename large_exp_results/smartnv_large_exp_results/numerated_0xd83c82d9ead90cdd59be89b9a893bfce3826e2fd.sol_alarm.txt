Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" variable in the Proposal struct is updated in the execute function without a mechanism to ensure atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent states.
2) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of functions that involve transferring tokens, it may not complete the desired operations, leading to incomplete transactions.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "owner" variable is set to internal, which may not be intended and could lead to ownership vulnerabilities.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal addresses stored in the startingBalanceList mapping, which may lead to potential conflicts or issues.
5) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function involving getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 might be subject to arithmetic flaws if not handled properly.
