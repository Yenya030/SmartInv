The contract provided for analysis:

contract PaymentSplitter {
    address[] public payees;
    uint[] public shares;
    
    constructor(address[] memory _payees, uint[] memory _shares) {
        require(_payees.length == _shares.length, "Payees and shares length mismatch");
        
        for (uint i = 0; i < _payees.length; i++) {
            payees.push(_payees[i]);
            shares.push(_shares[i]);
        }
    }
    
    function release() public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < payees.length; i++) {
            address(uint160(payees[i])).transfer(shares[i]);
        }
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer underflow if the shares are not properly validated before the transfer.
2) Ether leakage: The use of transfer in the release function can potentially lead to ether leaking if the transfer fails halfway through the loop execution.
3) Insufficient gas: The release function may run out of gas if there are too many payees or the loop iteration exceeds the block gas limit.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the payees and shares arrays is public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties.
