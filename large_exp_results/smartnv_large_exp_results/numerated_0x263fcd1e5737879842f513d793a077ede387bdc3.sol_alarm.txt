The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without properly synchronizing state changes, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute performs multiple operations that consume gas, and if the contract balance is low on gas, the execution of these operations may fail.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables owner, votingToken, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds, which may lead to access control issues.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks mechanisms to ensure uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which may result in conflicting proposals or unintended behavior.

5) Atomicity violation: The functions startExecute and execute do not use proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity of their operations, which may lead to race conditions and inconsistent outcomes.
