This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without considering the atomicity of the operation, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions attempt to update the variable concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not properly define the token-related functions such as transfer, transferFrom, etc., which could lead to incorrect behavior and ownership vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
