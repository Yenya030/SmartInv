Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or addresses, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended access level for this variable. Consider revisiting the visibility of this variable based on the contract's requirements.
