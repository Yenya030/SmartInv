The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `setTokenAOwner` function allows any user to change the ownership of `tokenA` without proper authorization checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- Inconsistent state update: In the `swap` function, there is a possibility of a race condition where the tokens are transferred before updating the balances, leading to an inconsistent state.
- Atomicity violation: The `swap` function lacks atomicity in transferring tokens, making it susceptible to reentrancy attacks.
- Ether leakage: The contract accepts Ether transfers but does not handle them securely, which may result in unintended Ether loss.
