The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the owner variable, leaving it open to potential manipulation or unauthorized access.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without ensuring that the transfer of tokens is successful, which can result in the contract's state being inconsistent.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for the balance of the contract but does not consider the gas cost of the function execution, which may lead to insufficient gas for the operation.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Insufficient gas.
