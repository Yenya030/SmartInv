Given the code snippet provided below, the potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are as follows:

<\contract_to_analyze\> 
contract Escrow {
     address public buyer;
     address public seller;
     address public arbiter;
     bool public buyerAgreed;
     bool public sellerAgreed;
     bool public arbiterAgreed;

     constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter) public {
          buyer = msg.sender;
          seller = _seller;
          arbiter = _arbiter;
     }

     function confirmPurchase() public {
          require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can confirm purchase");
          buyerAgreed = true;
     }

     function confirmReceived() public {
          require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can confirm received");
          require(buyerAgreed == true && sellerAgreed == true, "Both parties must agree");
          seller.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }

     function confirmRefund() public {
          require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can confirm refund");
          require(buyerAgreed == true && sellerAgreed == false, "Conditions not met for refund");
          buyer.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }
}
<\contract_to_analyze\> 

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Since there are no access control modifiers like onlyOwner, any address can call the functions like confirmPurchase, confirmReceived, and confirmRefund. This can lead to unauthorized execution of critical functions by unauthorized parties.
