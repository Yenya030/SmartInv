The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) integer overflow/underflow: The balances mapping could potentially be vulnerable to integer overflow if the balances exceed the maximum uint256 value.
2) insufficient gas: Possible risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions due to the potential complexity of operations.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, which can expose sensitive information. Consider using private or internal visibility instead.
