Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not maintain consistent state updates, as the `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is incremented without any checks or restrictions on the maximum amount that can be voted. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the total voted amount exceeds a certain limit.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level. Depending on the contract's requirements, this could be a vulnerability if the ownership needs to be properly secured or managed.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function uses a gas-intensive operation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas and cause the transaction to fail if there is insufficient gas provided.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract may violate ID uniqueness if there are no checks or mechanisms in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier. This could lead to conflicts or errors when processing multiple proposals simultaneously.
