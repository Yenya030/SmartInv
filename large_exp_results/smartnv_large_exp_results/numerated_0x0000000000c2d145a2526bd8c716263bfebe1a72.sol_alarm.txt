The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` is updating the `lockedFunds` variable without any restrictions or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the `proposal` struct and `lockedFunds` variable, which could lead to potential visibility issues.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
