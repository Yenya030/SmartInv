The contract for analysis is as follows:

contract Voting {
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public userVotes;
    address public admin;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint256 amount) public {
        totalVotes += amount;
        userVotes[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function resetVotes() public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can reset votes");
        totalVotes = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
            address user = getUserByIndex(i);
            userVotes[user] = 0;
        }
    }

    function getUserByIndex(uint256 index) internal view returns (address) {
        // implementation
    }
}

Output: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The resetVotes function resets user votes based on the totalVotes count, which may not accurately represent the current userVotes mapping.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to view and potentially modify the contract's admin status, which can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
