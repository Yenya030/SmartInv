The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has internal state variables like proposal and startingBalanceList that are being updated in the startExecute function without ensuring proper synchronization.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may consume a significant amount of gas due to the check for execution failure, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the necessary functions like transfer or balanceOf, which could lead to functionality issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Insufficient gas
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
