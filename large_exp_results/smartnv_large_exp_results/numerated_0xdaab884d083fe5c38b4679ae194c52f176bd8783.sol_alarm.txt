Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) atomicity violation: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute perform multiple state changes without using mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if one part of the process fails.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the owner variable is meant to be publicly accessible or if there are intended access control mechanisms in place. This lack of clarity may lead to issues related to ownership and visibility.

3) insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the operations within the functions, there may be a risk of running out of gas during execution, especially in endExecute where a large number of calculations and transfers are performed.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to atomicity violations, ownership/visibility issues, and gas limitations.
