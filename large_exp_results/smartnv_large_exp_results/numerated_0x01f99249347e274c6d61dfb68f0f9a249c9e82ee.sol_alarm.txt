Contract:

contract Escrow {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0, "Insufficient balance");
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Output:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
2) reentrancy
