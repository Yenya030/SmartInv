The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" state variable is being updated directly in the "endExecute" function without any validation or protection. This can lead to inconsistent states if the update fails or if there are concurrency issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct and related variables are not properly encapsulated or protected, which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation by external actors.
