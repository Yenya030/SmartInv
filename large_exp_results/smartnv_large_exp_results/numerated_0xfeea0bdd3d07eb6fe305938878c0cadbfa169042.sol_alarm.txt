The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but it does not define all the necessary functions required by the interface. Additionally, the `owner` variable is not being utilized or properly updated, indicating a possible issue with ownership control.
