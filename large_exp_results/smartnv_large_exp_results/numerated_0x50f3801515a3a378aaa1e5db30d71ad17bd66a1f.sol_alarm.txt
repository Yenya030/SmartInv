The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

```solidity
contract VotingContract {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint _value) public {
        votes[msg.sender] = _value;
    }

    function updateAdmin(address _newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can update admin");
        admin = _newAdmin;
    }

    function getVotes(address _voter) public view returns (uint) {
        return votes[_voter];
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The `updateAdmin` function does not restrict who can become the new admin, allowing potential privilege escalation if an attacker is able to call this function and set themselves as the new admin.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is declared as `public`, which exposes the contract's admin address to the public. It would be better to use `private` or `internal` visibility for sensitive variables like the admin address.
