Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs, which could lead to issues with data integrity and potentially allow for duplicate IDs to be created.

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for some functions, leaving them open to potential unauthorized access or manipulation. Additionally, the contract does not specify ownership mechanisms, which could lead to issues with control and management of the contract.
