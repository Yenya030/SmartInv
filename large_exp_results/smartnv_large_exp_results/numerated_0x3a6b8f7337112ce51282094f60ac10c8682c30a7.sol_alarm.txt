The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates `lockedFunds` based on the `balanceOf` calculation which may not accurately reflect the actual locked funds in the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not define any of the functions required by the interface, such as `transfer` and `balanceOf`, which may lead to issues with interoperability.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, which could potentially lead to conflicts or confusion when multiple proposals are initiated concurrently.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and ID uniqueness violation.
