The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state without ensuring the previous proposal has been completed or cancelled, leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which could potentially expose the contract to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
