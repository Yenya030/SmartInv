The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is: 

contract Auction {
     mapping(address => uint) public bids;
     address public highestBidder;
     uint public highestBid;
     
     function placeBid(uint bidAmount) public {
         require(bidAmount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than the current highest bid");
         bids[msg.sender] += bidAmount;
         highestBidder = msg.sender;
         highestBid = bidAmount;
     }
     
     function withdrawBid() public {
         require(bids[msg.sender] > 0, "No bid to withdraw");
         bids[msg.sender] = 0;
     }
 }
