Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow in functions like calculatePrice() where division is used.
2) Incorrect visibility in variables like debt and collateral, which could expose sensitive data.
3) Insufficient gas in functions like liquidate(), where external calls are made without specifying gas limits.
4) Business logic flaw in the liquidate() function where the price calculation might not be accurate.
