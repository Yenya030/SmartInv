Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the proposal's votedAmount without proper synchronization or protection, which may lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing an interface IERC20 but does not provide the required functions, potentially causing issues with visibility or ownership.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are no checks for potential integer overflow/underflow in the calculations involving votedAmount, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if the gas limit is not sufficient to complete the execution, potentially causing issues with the contract's functionality.
