The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenEscrow {
    address public token;
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;

    constructor(address _token, address _seller, address _buyer) public {
        token = _token;
        seller = _seller;
        buyer = _buyer;
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit funds");
        // Transfers funds from buyer to smart contract
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(buyer, address(this), amount);
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can release funds");
        // Transfers funds from smart contract to seller
        IERC20(token).transfer(seller, IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenEscrow contract:

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The deposit and release functions only check for the buyer and seller addresses respectively, but do not have proper access control modifiers like onlyBuyer or onlySeller. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of funds by other parties.

2) inconsistent state update: There is no check to ensure that the release function can only be called after the deposit function has been successfully executed. This could lead to funds being released without a prior deposit, resulting in a loss for the buyer.

3) atomicity violation: The deposit and release functions are not atomic, meaning that an external contract could potentially manipulate the state in between the deposit and release operations, leading to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the TokenEscrow contract are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
- inconsistent state update
- atomicity violation
