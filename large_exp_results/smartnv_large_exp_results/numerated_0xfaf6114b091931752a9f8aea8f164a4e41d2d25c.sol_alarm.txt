The contract you are going to analyze:
contract Auction {
        uint public highestBid;
        address public highestBidder;

        function placeBid(uint amount) public {
            require(amount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
            highestBidder.transfer(highestBid); 
            highestBidder = msg.sender;
            highestBid = amount;
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the above contract are:
1) Reentrancy
2) Inconsistent state update
