Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the "endExecute" function could result in an inconsistent state if the check for the execution's success is based on the total supply of the voting token being less than twice the balance held by the contract, which may not accurately reflect the success criteria.

2) Insufficient gas: The execution of the "endExecute" function may fail if there is insufficient gas to complete the required operations, especially when calculating the total balance of the voting token and comparing it to twice the balance held by the contract.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions within the contract may not be appropriately set, potentially leading to unauthorized access or unintended behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
