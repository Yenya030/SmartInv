The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without considering the impact of potential reentrancy attacks.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions should be restricted to only the owner of the contract, but there is no modifier or check for ownership in place.
