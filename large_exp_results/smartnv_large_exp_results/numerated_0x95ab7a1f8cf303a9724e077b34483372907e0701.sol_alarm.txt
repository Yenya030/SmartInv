Contract:
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
        votes[msg.sender] += _amount;
        totalVotes += _amount;
    }

    function redeem(uint _amount) public {
        require(votes[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Not enough votes to redeem");
        votes[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        totalVotes -= _amount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The totalVotes variable is updated in the vote and redeem functions separately, which could lead to inconsistencies if one function is called multiple times before the other.
- Arithmetic flaw: The redeem function does not check for potential underflow when subtracting _amount from votes[msg.sender] and totalVotes.
- Insufficient gas: If the number of votes becomes very high, the contract may require excessive gas to execute the redeem function, potentially leading to transaction failures.
