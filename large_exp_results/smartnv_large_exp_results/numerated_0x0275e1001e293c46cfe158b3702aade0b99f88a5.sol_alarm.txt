The contract to analyze:

contract PaymentProcessor {
    mapping(address => uint) public payments;

    function pay() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Payment amount must be greater than 0");
        payments[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        uint amount = payments[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
        payments[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
