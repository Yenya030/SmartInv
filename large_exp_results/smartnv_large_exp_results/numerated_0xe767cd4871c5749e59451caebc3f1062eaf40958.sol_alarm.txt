Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as it solely relies on a fixed percentage (80%) comparison between the collateral and debt amounts to determine if a user's funds can be liquidated. This simplistic comparison may not accurately reflect the actual financial health of the user's position.
2) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract may be vulnerable to price manipulation as it returns the ratio of USDC balance to WETH balance in the Uniswap pair without any external validation or verification mechanism. An attacker could potentially manipulate the balances in the pair to exploit this function.
