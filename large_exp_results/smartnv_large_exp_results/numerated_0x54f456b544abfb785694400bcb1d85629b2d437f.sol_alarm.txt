This contract has the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if there is an ongoing proposal or validating the caller's permission level.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks a mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which can lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: The execute function updates the votedAmount variable without using synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to race conditions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the proposal struct, making it publicly accessible.
