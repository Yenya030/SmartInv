Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract may be susceptible to privilege escalation if certain functions can be accessed by unauthorized parties, allowing them to manipulate the proposal or execution process improperly.
2) Inconsistent state update: There could be inconsistencies in updating the state of the proposal, such as not updating certain variables correctly or in the proper order, leading to unexpected behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: If multiple operations within a function are not executed atomically, there is a risk of inconsistent data updates or unintended outcomes.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables may not be properly set, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modification.
