Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update in the `startExecute` function with the assignment of `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance;`.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function without any visibility specifier, which could lead to potential issues related to visibility and access control.
