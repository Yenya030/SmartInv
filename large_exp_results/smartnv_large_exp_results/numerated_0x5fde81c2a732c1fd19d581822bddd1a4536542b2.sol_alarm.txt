This contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
-  Inconsistent state update: The state variable `proposal` is updated in the `startExecute()` function but not reset after execution, which may lead to inconsistent state.
-  Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract declares to implement the `IERC20` interface but does not include the required functions for a valid implementation, which could result in incorrect behavior or contract ownership issues.
-  Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function might fail if there is insufficient gas to cover the gas cost of all the operations within the function.
-  Integer overflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate()` function, which can result in incorrect computations and unexpected behavior.
