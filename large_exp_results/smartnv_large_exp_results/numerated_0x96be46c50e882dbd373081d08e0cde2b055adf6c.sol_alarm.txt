The contract provided for analysis is: 

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
    }

    function vote(uint256 option) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = option;
        sender.weight = 1;
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of voter addresses, which could lead to issues with overwriting voter information.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential issue with inconsistent state updates as the delegate function sets the "voted" flag to true without specifying a condition for it.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The voters mapping is public, which exposes all voter information to anyone, potentially compromising voter privacy.
4) Business logic flaw: There is a lack of validation or restrictions on the options for voting, which could lead to unexpected or unauthorized votes.
