The potential vulnerabilities in the "TokenSale" contract are:
1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The "setPrice" function only checks if the caller is the contract owner but does not restrict access to only the owner.
2) Insufficient Gas: The "buyTokens" function may run out of gas if the amount being bought is too large, which could potentially lead to an incomplete transaction.
