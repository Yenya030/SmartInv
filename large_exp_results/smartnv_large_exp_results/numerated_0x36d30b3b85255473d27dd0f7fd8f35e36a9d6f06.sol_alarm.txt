Vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract `TimelockController` does not restrict access to the `execute` function, allowing anyone to execute the function, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update in the `endExecute` function as it updates `lockedFunds` based on a condition that checks the balance of the contract, which could lead to incorrect state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables such as `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which could lead to potential visibility issues or ownership concerns.
