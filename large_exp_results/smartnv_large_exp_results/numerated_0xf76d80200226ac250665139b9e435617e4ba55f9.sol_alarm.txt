The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract could be:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin address is publicly visible, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation by external parties.
2) Inconsistent state update: The total number of tokens sold is updated without proper synchronization, which could lead to data integrity issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function does not include gas stipend considerations, which could result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas provided for the token transfers.
4) Atomicity violation: The buyTokens function does multiple state-changing operations in a sequence without proper atomicity guarantees, which could lead to inconsistent states in case of failures during execution.
