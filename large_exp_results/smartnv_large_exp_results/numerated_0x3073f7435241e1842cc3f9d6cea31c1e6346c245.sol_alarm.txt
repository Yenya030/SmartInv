Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The loop in the resetVotes function is mistakenly setting the hasVoted mapping to false for msg.sender instead of iterating through all addresses.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The totalVotes variable is publicly readable, which may not be desired depending on the use case of the contract.
