The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without considering potential race conditions, leading to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions modify the same proposal simultaneously.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal IDs, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are initiated with the same ID.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may fail to complete if there is insufficient gas provided for the required operations, leading to potential issues with the execution of the contract.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership of some variables and functions, which could lead to unintended access and manipulation by external parties.
