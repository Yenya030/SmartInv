The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables "proposal.sTime" and "proposal.votedAmount" in the "execute" function, which can lead to inconsistent state if not properly handled.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility modifiers for the functions "votedProposal" and "getStartingBalance", which can lead to potential vulnerabilities if the functions are unintentionally exposed to external parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
