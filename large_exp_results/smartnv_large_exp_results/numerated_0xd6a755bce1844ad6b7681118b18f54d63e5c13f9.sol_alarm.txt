The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function does not have proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent multiple calls that could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The startExecute and endExecute functions are externally accessible, which may not be intended and could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract state.
