The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify any gas limits for the transfer functions, which could result in out-of-gas errors during execution.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variable `balances` is public, allowing anyone to view the balances of any address. It should be made private for better security practices.
