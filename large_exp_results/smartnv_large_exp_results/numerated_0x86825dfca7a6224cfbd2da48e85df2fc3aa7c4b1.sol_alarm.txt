The contract provided for analysis:

contract TimeLockedController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }

    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The struct Proposal does not have a unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to issues in managing multiple proposals.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the startExecute function updates the proposal state without proper checks, which could lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is declared but not used or initialized, which could lead to ownership-related vulnerabilities.

4) Incomplete logic: It seems like there may be missing parts of the contract (e.g., getStartingBalance function) that could impact the overall functionality and security.

Therefore, potential vulnerabilities in the contract include ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and incomplete logic.
