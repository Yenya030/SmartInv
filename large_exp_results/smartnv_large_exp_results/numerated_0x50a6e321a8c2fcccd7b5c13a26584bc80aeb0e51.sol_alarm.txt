The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal without ensuring that the transfer of tokens is successful, which could result in an inconsistent state if the transfer fails after updating the proposal.

2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() updates multiple state variables without having proper atomicity guarantees, which could lead to inconsistencies if an error occurs midway through the execution.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks whether the balance of the contract is greater than a certain amount without considering the gas cost of executing the function, potentially leading to an out-of-gas error during execution.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility for the variables owner, votingToken, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds, which could lead to unintended access or modification of these variables by external contracts.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions, which could lead to potential ether leakage if ether is sent to the contract address accidentally.

6) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility for the function votedProposal(), which could lead to unintended access by external contracts.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, ether leakage, and potential reentrancy issues.
