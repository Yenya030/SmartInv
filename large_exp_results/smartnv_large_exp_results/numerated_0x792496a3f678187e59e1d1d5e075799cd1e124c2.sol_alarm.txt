The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of `lockedFunds`, `votedProposal`, `getStartingBalance`, and `startingBalanceList` functions or variables. It is important to ensure proper visibility for security reasons.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without using proper synchronization techniques, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially expensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) but does not handle potential out-of-gas scenarios. This could result in a failed execution of the contract.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not include any fields to ensure uniqueness of proposals, which could lead to vulnerabilities related to duplicate or conflicting proposals.

5) Privilege escalation: The contract uses an `internal` visibility modifier for the `owner` variable without any mechanisms to restrict access, potentially allowing privilege escalation attacks.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions or payments securely, which could lead to potential Ether leakage vulnerabilities.

7) Inconsistent state update: The `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract updates the state variable `pair` without any synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
