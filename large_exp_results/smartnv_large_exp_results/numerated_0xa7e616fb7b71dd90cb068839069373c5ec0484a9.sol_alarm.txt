<\The Contract to Analyze\>
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only highest bidder can withdraw");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(highestBid);
        highestBid = 0;
