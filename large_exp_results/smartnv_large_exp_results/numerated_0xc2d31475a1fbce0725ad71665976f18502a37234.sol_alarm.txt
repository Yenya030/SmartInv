Given the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Reentrancy: There is a vulnerability in the transferFrom function that could potentially allow for reentrancy attacks.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow or underflow in the calculatePrice function depending on the values returned by balanceOf function calls.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables such as debt, collateral, WETH, USDC, pair should be carefully considered to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
