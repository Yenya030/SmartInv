Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation bug: The contract does not properly enforce access control, allowing anyone to call functions like execute and endExecute without proper authorization.
- Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state updates as the execution of startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions does not ensure proper synchronization of state changes.
- Integer overflow: There is potential for integer overflow in the calculation of startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; and proposal.votedAmount += amount; which may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like proposal, startingBlance, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds is not specified properly, potentially causing security issues related to data visibility and ownership control.
