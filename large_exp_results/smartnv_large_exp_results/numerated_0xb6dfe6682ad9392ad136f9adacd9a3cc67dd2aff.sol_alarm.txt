Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `startingBalanceList` mapping is updated in the `startExecute` function without strictly initializing it, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal` which might expose it to external contracts and could lead to incorrect ownership handling or visibility.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
