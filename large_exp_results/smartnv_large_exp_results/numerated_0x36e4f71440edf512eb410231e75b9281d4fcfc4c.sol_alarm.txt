The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates as there is a lack of synchronization between the proposal struct variables being updated in different functions.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract may be vulnerable to integer overflow/underflow issues as there are arithmetic operations being performed without proper checks, such as in the function endExecute().

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract may have incorrect visibility/ownership as the owner variable is declared as internal, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
