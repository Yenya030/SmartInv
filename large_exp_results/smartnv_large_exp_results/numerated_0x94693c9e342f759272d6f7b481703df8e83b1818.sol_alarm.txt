The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is updated directly in the function without using proper synchronization methods, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and its visibility and ownership are not clear, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The gas cost of executing the `endExecute` function might be high due to the calculations and balance checks, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors when running the function.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
