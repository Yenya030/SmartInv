1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without specifying the full definition of `proposal` or initializing it. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field within the `proposal` struct directly, which may result in inconsistent state if not handled properly.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is missing the definition of the `votedProposal` function, which might lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
