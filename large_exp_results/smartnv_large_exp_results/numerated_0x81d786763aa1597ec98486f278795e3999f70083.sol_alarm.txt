Contract:

contract TokenSale {
     IERC20 public token;
     address public owner;
     uint public price;

     constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
         token = _token;
         owner = msg.sender;
         price = _price;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
         uint cost = amount * price;
         require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cost, "Not enough tokens to buy");
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, cost);
     }

     function setPrice(uint newPrice) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set the price");
         price = newPrice;
     }

     function withdrawTokens() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw tokens");
         token.transfer(owner, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
     }
}

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `setPrice` and `withdrawTokens` functions only have a simple check for the owner, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation if the owner address is compromised.
- Price manipulation: The `buyTokens` function calculates the cost based on the amount and the price set by the owner, making it vulnerable to price manipulation if the owner sets the price incorrectly or maliciously.
- Insufficient gas: If the `withdrawTokens` function is called by the owner with insufficient gas, the token transfer may fail, leading to potential issues with withdrawal functionality.
