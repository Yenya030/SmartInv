The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    IERC20 public token;

    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Insufficient gas: The `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions could potentially run out of gas during execution, especially if handling a large number of transactions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not specified who can call the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions, which could lead to ownership or access control issues.
