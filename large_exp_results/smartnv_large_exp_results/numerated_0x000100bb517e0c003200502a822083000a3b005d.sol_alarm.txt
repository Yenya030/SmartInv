The contract provided for analysis: 

contract Auction {
    uint public highestBid;
    address public highestBidder;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(highestBid);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Auction contract:
1) Reentrancy vulnerability in the bid() function.
2) Inconsistent state update vulnerability in the bid() function.
3) Price manipulation vulnerability in the bid() function.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability for highestBidder in the withdraw() function.
5) Insufficient gas vulnerability in the withdraw() function.
