The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct before setting the `startingBlance`, which could lead to inconsistent state if `getStartingBalance` fails or reverts.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface `IERC20`, but the functions and variables within the contract don't correspond to the interface. This could lead to incorrect behavior or ownership.
3) Insufficient gas: If the execution of the `endExecute` function requires more gas than available, it may fail to execute properly.
4) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function increments `proposal.votedAmount` without using a locking mechanism, potentially leading to a race condition and inconsistent state.
5) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than double the total supply of the token, which might not be appropriate business logic for execution.
