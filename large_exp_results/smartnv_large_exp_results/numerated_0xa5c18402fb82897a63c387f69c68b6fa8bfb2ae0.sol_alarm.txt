Vulnerabilities: 
1) Insufficient gas - The transfer function in the contract does not include a gas stipend, which may potentially lead to failing transactions due to insufficient gas.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The 'owner' variable is declared as public, which may expose the owner of the contract to potential security risks. 

3) ID uniqueness violation - The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of addresses, which can lead to confusion or incorrect operation due to non-unique addresses.
