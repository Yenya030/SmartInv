The contract potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking for existing proposals, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
   
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract does not specify visibility or access control modifiers for the owner variable, leaving it susceptible to unauthorized modifications.
