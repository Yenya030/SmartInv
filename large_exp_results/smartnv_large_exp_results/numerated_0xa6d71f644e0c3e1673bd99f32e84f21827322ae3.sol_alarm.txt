The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `startingBalanceList` without checking if the proposal has already started, potentially allowing for inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is internal, which may restrict its visibility and lead to ownership control issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
