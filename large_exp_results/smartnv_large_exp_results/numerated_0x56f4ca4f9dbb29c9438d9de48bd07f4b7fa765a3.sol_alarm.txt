The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function increments proposal.votedAmount without taking into consideration potential reentrancy issues or double-counting.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may lead to confusion or unintended access control issues. 

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
