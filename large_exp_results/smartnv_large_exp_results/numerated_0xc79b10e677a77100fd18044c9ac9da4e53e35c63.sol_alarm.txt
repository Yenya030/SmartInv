Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculation within the `liquidate()` function, especially when multiplying `getPrice()`, `cAmount`, and `80`.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables `debt`, `collateral`, `WETH`, `USDC`, and `pair` is set to public, which may expose sensitive information or functionality to unauthorized parties. Consider changing the visibility or implementing access control mechanisms.
