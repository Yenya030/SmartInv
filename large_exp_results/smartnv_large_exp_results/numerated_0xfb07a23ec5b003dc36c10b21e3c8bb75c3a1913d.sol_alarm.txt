Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates `lockedFunds` without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are several arithmetic operations in the contract without proper checks for potential integer overflow/underflow, such as in the function `liquidate()` and `calculatePrice()`.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBlance`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` is not explicitly defined, which can lead to incorrect accessibility and ownership concerns.
