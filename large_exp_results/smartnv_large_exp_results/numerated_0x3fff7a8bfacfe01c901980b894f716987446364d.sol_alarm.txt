The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not provide the required functions specified in the interface. This may lead to inconsistencies and issues if the functions are not correctly implemented.

2) Atomicity violation: In the `execute` function, multiple operations are being performed without being wrapped in a single atomic transaction. This can lead to inconsistencies if one of the operations fails after the other has already occurred.

3) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly without proper synchronization. This can lead to incorrect values being stored if multiple calls are made concurrently.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are potential risks of integer overflow/underflow in the calculations performed in the `liquidate` function, especially in the expression `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`. Careful consideration should be given to ensure that these calculations do not result in unexpected behavior.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not have any mechanisms in place to handle unexpected Ether transfers. This can potentially lead to Ether being trapped in the contract, causing loss of funds.

6) Insufficient gas: The operations in the contract, such as transferring tokens, may require additional gas than what is accounted for. This could lead to transactions failing due to running out of gas.

7) Inconsistent state update: In the `calculatePrice` function, the return value is based on the balances of tokens in the Uniswap pair contract. However, these balances may change unpredictably, leading to an inconsistent price calculation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, ether leakage, insufficient gas, and inconsistent state update.
