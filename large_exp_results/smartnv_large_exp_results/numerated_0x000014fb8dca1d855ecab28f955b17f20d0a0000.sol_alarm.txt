Contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;

    address public admin;

    modifier onlyAdmin() {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can call this function");
        _;
    }

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted");
        require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is disallowed");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation");
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;

        Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];
        if (delegateTo.voted) {
            voters[delegateTo.vote].weight += sender.weight;
        } else {
            delegateTo.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint256 _proposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = _proposal;
    }

    function execute() public onlyAdmin {
        // Some execution logic here
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
