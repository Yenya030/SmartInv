The contract you provided is:
contract Escrow {
     address public payer;
     address payable public payee;
     address public escrowAgent;
     uint public amount;

     constructor(address _payer, address payable _payee, uint _amount, address _escrowAgent) public {
          payer = _payer;
          payee = _payee;
          escrowAgent = _escrowAgent;
          amount = _amount;
     }

     function deposit() public payable {
          require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can deposit");
     }

     function release() public {
          require(msg.sender == escrowAgent, "Only escrow agent can release");
          payee.transfer(amount);
     }

     function refund() public {
          require(msg.sender == escrowAgent, "Only escrow agent can refund");
          payer.transfer(amount);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The release and refund functions can be called by anyone who is not the escrow agent if they know the address of the escrow agent, making it vulnerable to privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is no check to ensure that the release or refund functions are only called after the deposit function has been successfully completed, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: If the amount being transferred in the release or refund functions exceeds the gas limit, it could result in a failed transaction, leaving the funds in an inconsistent state.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The transfer of funds in the release and refund functions could potentially result in inconsistencies between separate blockchains or tokens, if the contract interacts with different chains or tokens.
5) Suicidal contracts: If the escrowAgent address is set to the address of a contract that can self-destruct, it could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.
6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether sent to it without calling a function, which can result in lost Ether if users mistakenly send Ether directly to the contract address.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Cross bridge inconsistency
- Suicidal contracts
- Ether leakage
