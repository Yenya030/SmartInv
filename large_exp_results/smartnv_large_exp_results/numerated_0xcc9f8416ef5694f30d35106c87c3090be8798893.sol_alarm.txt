Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains a function `endExecute` that updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a condition that involves comparing the result of two function calls (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`). If the balance of the token or the total supply of the token changes between the two function calls, it may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but does not provide definitions for all the required functions of the interface, such as `transfer` and `balanceOf`. This could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or ownership issues if external contracts or users interact with this contract assuming it fully implements the interface.
