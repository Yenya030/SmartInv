The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in ExchangeTokens updates the debt and collateral mappings without any checks, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions in both contracts do not specify the visibility of the functions, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
