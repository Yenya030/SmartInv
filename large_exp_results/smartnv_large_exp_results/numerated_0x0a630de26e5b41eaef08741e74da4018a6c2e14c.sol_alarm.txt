The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `startingBalance` is misspelled as `startingBlance` in the `startExecute` function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal but never used, which might indicate a discrepancy in ownership control.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have any unique identifier associated with it, which might lead to confusion when managing multiple proposals.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced but not defined in the contract, indicating a possible issue with visibility or ownership access.
5) Business logic flaw: The condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` in the `endExecute` function might not correctly ensure the validity of the execution process and funds.

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract have been identified as listed above.
