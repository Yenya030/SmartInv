Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a condition, which can lead to inconsistent state if the condition is not met.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes such as transferring tokens and updating the `proposal` struct, which can potentially lead to atomicity violations if all state changes are not executed atomically.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define all the required functions specified by the interface, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
