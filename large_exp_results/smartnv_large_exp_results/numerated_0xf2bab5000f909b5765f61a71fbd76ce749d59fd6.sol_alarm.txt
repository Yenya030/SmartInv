Contract to be analyzed:
contract Marketplace {
         IERC20 public token;
         address public owner;

         function buy(uint amount) public {
             uint price = amount * 10;
             require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= price, "Insufficient balance");
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, price);
         }

         function sell(uint amount) public {
             require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, amount);
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation of the price in the buy function may suffer from an arithmetic flaw as it multiplies the amount by 10 without considering potential overflow or underflow.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public, which could potentially lead to incorrect access to the owner of the contract.
3) Insufficient gas: The sell function does not specify a gas limit, which could potentially lead to insufficient gas for the transaction to be completed successfully.
