Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows execution of functions based on the value of certain variables, which can be manipulated to escalate privileges.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract has functions that update state variables without proper validation, leading to potential inconsistencies.
3) Atomicity violation: The contract doesn't ensure atomicity of operations, which can result in unexpected behavior.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract may have visibility or ownership issues that can be exploited by malicious actors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
