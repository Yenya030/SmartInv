The contract to analyze:
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        votes[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function checkVotes() public view returns(uint) {
        return votes[msg.sender];
    }

    function getTotalVotes() public view returns(uint) {
        return totalVotes;
    }
} 

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract VotingSystem are:
1) ID uniqueness violation - as there is no check to ensure that the same address cannot vote multiple times.
2) Inconsistent state update - the totalVotes variable is directly incremented without any additional checks, which could lead to inconsistencies.
3) Insufficient gas - if there are a significant number of votes, the gas required to execute the functions might exceed the gas limit.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership - the variables votes and totalVotes are public, which allows anyone to access and potentially manipulate them.
