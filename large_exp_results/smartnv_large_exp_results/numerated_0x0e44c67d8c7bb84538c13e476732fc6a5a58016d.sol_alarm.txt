The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `startingBalanceList` without any proper validation or synchronization mechanism, which might lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract seems to implement the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the necessary functions to comply with the interface, which can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
