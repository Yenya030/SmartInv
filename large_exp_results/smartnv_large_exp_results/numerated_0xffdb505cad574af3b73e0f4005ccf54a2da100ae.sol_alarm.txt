The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The use of 'proposal' struct and its related variables (sTime, votedAmount, addr) are updated in startExecute() and execute() functions without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, leading to possible inconsistent state updates.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The 'startingBalanceList' mapping is used to store starting balances for different addresses without any uniqueness check on the 'addr' parameter, which can potentially lead to ID uniqueness violations.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the operations and number of stored proposals, there might be scenarios where the contract requires more gas than available gas limit, leading to insufficient gas issues during contract execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and insufficient gas.
