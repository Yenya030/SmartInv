The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may suffer from inconsistent state update as the state variables are not properly updated in a synchronized manner, leading to potential issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: There may be an issue with the visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables within the contract, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modifications.
