The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Wallet {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Reentrancy vulnerability in the withdraw function - The transfer of funds to the msg.sender is done before updating the balance. This could allow a malicious contract to call back into the withdraw function before the balance is updated, leading to reentrancy attacks.
2) Ether leakage - The deposit function does not check for overflow when adding the deposited amount to the balance, which could result in ether being lost due to overflow.
3) Insufficient gas - If the balances mapping grows too large, the withdraw function may require more gas than the block gas limit, preventing users from withdrawing their funds.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is public, which exposes it to the entire blockchain. This could potentially lead to security risks if the owner's address is known to attackers.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Reentrancy
- Ether leakage
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
