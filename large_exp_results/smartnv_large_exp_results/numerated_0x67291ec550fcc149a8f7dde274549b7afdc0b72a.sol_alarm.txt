The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute are all marked as external, which means that they can be accessed by any external contract. It might be safer to make them internal or private to restrict access.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is updated by adding the transferred amount, which might lead to unexpected behavior if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks whether the execution is successful by comparing the balance of the contract with double the total supply of the voting token. This calculation might require a significant amount of gas and could potentially exceed the gas limit.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The proposal struct does not contain any unique identifier for proposals, which might lead to ambiguity or conflicts when multiple proposals are submitted.
5) Privilege escalation: The use of msg.sender in the startExecute function to set the proposal address can potentially lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
