The contract provided for analysis:

contract DecentralizedExchange {
         address public owner;
         IERC20 public token;

         function buy(uint amount) public {
             uint price = token.balanceOf(address(this)) / amount;
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
             payable(owner).transfer(amount * price);
         }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Price manipulation
2) Integer overflow/underflow
3) Ether leakage
