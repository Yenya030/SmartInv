This contract potentially contains vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables directly without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
   
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify proper visibility and ownership control for its functions and variables, which might lead to unauthorized access.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving arithmetic calculations that may result in integer overflow or underflow, especially in functions like `calculatePrice`.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, potentially leading to ether leakage.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract may require more gas to execute certain functions, leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Integer overflow/underflow, Ether leakage, Insufficient gas.
