There are potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount field of the proposal struct without ensuring atomicity or proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple executions occur concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide the required functions defined in the interface, which violates the correct visibility/ownership of the contract.
