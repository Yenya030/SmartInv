- Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() in the TimelockController contract updates the state of proposal, startingBalanceList, and calling getStartingBalance(proposal.addr) without ensuring the atomicity of the operation, which may lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
- Atomicity violation: The function endExecute() in the TimelockController contract updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract and votingToken.totalSupply() without considering atomicity, which can lead to unintended behavior if the balances change during the execution of the function.
