Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without initializing it first, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is declared as a local variable within the contract, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract's address, which could result in insufficient gas if the contract holds a large number of tokens.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
