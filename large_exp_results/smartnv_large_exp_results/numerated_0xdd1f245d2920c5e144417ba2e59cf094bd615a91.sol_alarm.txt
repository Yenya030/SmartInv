The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

<\example_1\> 

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw: Lack of proper validation for the endExecute function could potentially allow for unauthorized execution.
2) Inconsistent state update: There could be potential issues with storing and updating the proposal state, leading to incorrect data manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit is not set appropriately, it could lead to transaction failures during the execution of functions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables within the contract may not be properly defined, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are:
- Business logic flaw
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
