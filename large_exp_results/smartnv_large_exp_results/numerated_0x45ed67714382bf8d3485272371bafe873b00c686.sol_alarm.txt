The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not have the required functions of the interface.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal.votedAmount without ensuring atomicity.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function could potentially run out of gas if there are a large number of users with locked funds, leading to execution failure.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities identified in the given contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
