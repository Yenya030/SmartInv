The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function, but there is no check to prevent re-entry or multiple calls that could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations involving addition and multiplication in the "liquidate" function of the contract, which could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if the values involved are not properly checked.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Integer overflow/underflow
