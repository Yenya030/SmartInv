contract Escrow {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

} 

Potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, exposing all balances to anyone.
- Insufficient gas: The transfer function might fail if the gas provided is not enough.
- Ether leakage: There could be a risk of ether being stuck in the contract if the transfer or withdrawal fails.
