The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, and `startingBalanceList`. It is important to clearly define the visibility of variables to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistent state update issue in the function `startExecute()` where the `startingBalanceList` is updated based on `proposal.addr` without proper validation or checks.

3) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the function `execute()` where multiple state changes occur without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the function `endExecute()` where the calculation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` could potentially exceed the maximum value of the data type used, leading to unintended consequences.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle incoming Ether transactions, which could result in Ether being trapped in the contract without any way to withdraw it, potentially leading to Ether leakage.

6) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract perform multiple operations, such as token transfers, which could consume a significant amount of gas. There is a risk of out-of-gas errors if the contract does not provide enough gas for these operations to complete successfully. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, integer overflow/underflow, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
