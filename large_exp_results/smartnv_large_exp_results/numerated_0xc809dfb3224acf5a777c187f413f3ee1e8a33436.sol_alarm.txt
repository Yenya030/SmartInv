The contract to analyze is:

contract MyContract {
     address public owner;
     uint public balance;

     constructor() {
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function deposit(uint amount) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can deposit funds");
         balance += amount;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
         require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
         balance -= amount;
     }

     function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
         owner = newOwner;
     }
}

Output:
- healthy
