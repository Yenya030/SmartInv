Contract Analysis:

The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Business logic flaw: In the `endExecute` function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might lead to inconsistent state updates or unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The use of `lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));` in the `endExecute` function might result in inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `votingToken` and `proposal` is not clearly defined, which could lead to potential issues with contract ownership and data access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
