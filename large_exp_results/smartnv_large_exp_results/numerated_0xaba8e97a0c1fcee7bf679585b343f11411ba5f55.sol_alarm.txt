Contract being analyzed:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }
    
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    address public winner;
    
    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function delegate(address to) external {
        require(!voters[to].voted, "Delegatee has already voted");
        voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;
    }
    
    function vote(uint256 option) external {
        require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "Only registered voters can vote");
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Voter has already voted");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = option;
        totalVotes++;
    }
    
    function calculateWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can calculate winner");
        // Logic to calculate the winner based on the votes
    }
}

Output:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to view who the admin is, which may not be desirable in terms of security. Changing it to private would enhance security.
- insufficient gas: The calculateWinner function requires that the sender is the admin, but it does not check if there is enough gas to execute the function, potentially leading to a failed execution if the gas limit is exceeded. Implementing gas checks could prevent this issue.
