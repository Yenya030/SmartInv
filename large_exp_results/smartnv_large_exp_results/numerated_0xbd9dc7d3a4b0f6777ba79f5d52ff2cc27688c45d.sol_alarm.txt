The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are as follows:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `debt` and `collateral` mappings are publicly accessible which may expose sensitive user data.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `calculatePrice` function updates state variables (`USDC` and `WETH` balances) but does not actually update any permanent storage.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
