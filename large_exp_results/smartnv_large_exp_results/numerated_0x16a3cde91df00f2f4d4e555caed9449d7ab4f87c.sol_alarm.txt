The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- In the function endExecute(), the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");" seems to evaluate the balance of the contract's token against the total token supply. If the balance is supposed to represent locked funds for execution, this condition may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The visibility of variables like "lockedFunds" and "startingBalanceList" is not specified, which could lead to potential issues regarding data visibility and ownership control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
