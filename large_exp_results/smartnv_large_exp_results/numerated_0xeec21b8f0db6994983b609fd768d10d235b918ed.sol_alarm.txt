Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is being updated directly in the "execute" function without using safe math operations.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the IERC20 interface but does not actually define all the required functions and variables.
3) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit for transactions is too low, it may lead to execution failures in functions like "endExecute" where the contract checks for the balance comparison.
