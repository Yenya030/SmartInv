The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the `proposal` struct to store proposal information such as start time, voted amount, and address. However, there are multiple functions that update the `proposal` struct without properly checking or updating the state of the proposal. This can lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function transfers tokens using `votingToken.transferFrom`, which requires gas to execute. If the contract does not have enough gas available, the token transfer may fail, leading to potential issues with the execution of the function.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which means it can be accessed by contracts that inherit from `TimelockController`. Depending on the intended behavior, this may lead to issues related to visibility or ownership control. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
