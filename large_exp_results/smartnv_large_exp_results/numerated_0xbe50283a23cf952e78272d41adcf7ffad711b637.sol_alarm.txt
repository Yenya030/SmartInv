Based on the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function is updated directly without using safe arithmetic operations, which can potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if an overflow or underflow occurs.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but it doesn't actually define the required ERC20 token functions, such as `balanceOf`, `approve`, `transfer`, etc. This can lead to incorrect visibility and ownership of the contract functions related to ERC20 tokens.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
