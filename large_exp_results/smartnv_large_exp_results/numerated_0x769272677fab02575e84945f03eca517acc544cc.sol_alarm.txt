The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedProposal" function is referenced in the code snippet, but its implementation is not provided in the contract. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if the function modifies state variables without proper validation and authorization.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Some functions in the contract are defined as external, but they might require more restricted access control based on the functionality they provide. Adding modifiers like onlyOwner or access control checks can improve the contract's security.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
