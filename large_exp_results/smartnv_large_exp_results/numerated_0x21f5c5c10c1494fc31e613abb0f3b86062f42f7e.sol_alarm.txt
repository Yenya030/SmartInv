SuSel Contract Analysis:

Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "lockedFunds" is updated based on the balance of the contract's token, but there is no mechanism in place to ensure that the balance update is done atomically, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables "owner" and "votingToken," which could lead to unintended access and manipulation of these variables by external contracts.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the transaction flow and gas limits, there might be scenarios where executing certain functions such as "endExecute" could run out of gas before completion, leading to incomplete or failed execution.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The use of the "proposal" struct does not have any mechanism to ensure unique IDs for each proposal, which could result in conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that could impact its security and functionality.
