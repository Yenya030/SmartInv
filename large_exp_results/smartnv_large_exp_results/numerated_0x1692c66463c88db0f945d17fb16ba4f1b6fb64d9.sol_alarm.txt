The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:

<\contract\>
contract VotingSystem {
     struct Vote {
          address voter;
          uint256 voteAmount;
          bool voted;
          bool isAdmin;
     }

     mapping(address => uint) public votes;
     mapping(address => bool) public isAdmin;

     function vote(uint256 amount) external {
          require(amount > 0, "amount must be greater than 0");
          require(!votes[msg.sender].voted, "already voted");
          require(isAdmin[msg.sender], "only admins can vote");

          votes[msg.sender] = amount;
     }

     function addAdmin(address user) external {
          isAdmin[user] = true;
     }

     function removeAdmin(address user) external {
          isAdmin[user] = false;
     }
}
<\contract\> 

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- privilege escalation:
  - The isAdmin mapping allows any address to be marked as an admin, potentially leading to unauthorized access to voting capabilities.

- inconsistent state update:
  - The vote function updates the votes mapping without ensuring that previous votes have been properly processed, leading to potential data inconsistency.

- incorrect visibility/ownership:
  - The isAdmin mapping may not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing unintended addresses to gain admin privileges.
