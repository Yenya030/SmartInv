The contract provided for analysis is:

```
contract VotingSystem {
     struct Candidate {
         address candidateAddress;
         uint voteCount;
     }
     mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
     mapping(address => Candidate) public candidates;
     address public owner;

     function vote(address _candidateAddress) public {
         require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
         require(candidates[_candidateAddress].candidateAddress != address(0), "Candidate does not exist");
         candidates[_candidateAddress].voteCount++;
         hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
     }

     function addCandidate(address _candidateAddress) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can add a candidate");
         candidates[_candidateAddress].candidateAddress = _candidateAddress;
     }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Privilege Escalation (owner is the only one who can add a candidate, which may lead to privilege escalation if not properly secured)
2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership (owner is publicly accessible, which may reveal sensitive information or allow unauthorized access)
