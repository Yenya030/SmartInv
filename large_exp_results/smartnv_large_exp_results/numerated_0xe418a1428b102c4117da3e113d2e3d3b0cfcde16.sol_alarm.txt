The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure unique IDs for proposals in the TimelockController contract.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function in the TimelockController contract may face gas limitations when checking the balance condition.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable in the TimelockController contract is marked as internal, which may lead to ownership vulnerabilities.
