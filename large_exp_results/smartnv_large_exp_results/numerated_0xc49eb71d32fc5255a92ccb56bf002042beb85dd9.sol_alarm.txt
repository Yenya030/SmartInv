The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update: there is no check to ensure that endVoting can be called only once.
2) Privilege escalation: Setting the admin variable might be exploited for privilege escalation attacks.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is set without any access control mechanisms, making it prone to unauthorized modifications.
