The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables "lockedFunds" and "proposal", which could lead to potential issues with data manipulation or unauthorized access.

2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated in the "execute" function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which might lead to inconsistent state updates and potential issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function performs a gas-intensive operation by calculating the total balance of the token contract, which may lead to out-of-gas errors if the gas limit is not sufficient.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
