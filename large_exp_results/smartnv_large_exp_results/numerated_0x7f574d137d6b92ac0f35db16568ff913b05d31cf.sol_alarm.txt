Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Business logic flaw: The function `endExecute()` checks if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total supply of the token for execution, which may not be a proper condition for execution.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Business logic flaw and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
