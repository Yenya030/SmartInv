This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract doesn't track the state changes properly in the "startExecute" and "endExecute" functions.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable is not explicitly defined with a visibility modifier, potentially leading to issues of incorrect visibility or ownership.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution if the gas limits are not appropriately set, especially in the "endExecute" function where a large amount of gas may be needed if the conditions are not met.

Therefore, this contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
