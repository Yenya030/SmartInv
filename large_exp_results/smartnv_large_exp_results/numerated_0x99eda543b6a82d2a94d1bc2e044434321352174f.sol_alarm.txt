The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) privilege escalation - The contract does not enforce proper access control measures, allowing anyone to call functions and potentially manipulate the proposal status.
2) inconsistent state update - The proposal state is updated in the startExecute function without proper validation, leading to potential inconsistencies in the data.
3) insufficient gas - The endExecute function may fail if the gas limit is not sufficient to complete the required operations.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not clearly define ownership and visibility of certain variables and functions, leading to potential confusion and security risks.
