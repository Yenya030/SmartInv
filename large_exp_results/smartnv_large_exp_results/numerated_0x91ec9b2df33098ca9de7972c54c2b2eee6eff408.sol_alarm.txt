Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing IERC20, but it does not fully implement all the required functions of the interface. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Atomicity violation: The execute function transfers tokens and updates state variables separately, which could result in an inconsistent state if one of the operations fails.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks a condition that involves a potentially large number of token transfers, which could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of gas errors.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations in the contract that involve adding and subtracting amounts, which could lead to integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.
6) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ExchangeTokens contract does not specify the visibility of the getPrice function, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
