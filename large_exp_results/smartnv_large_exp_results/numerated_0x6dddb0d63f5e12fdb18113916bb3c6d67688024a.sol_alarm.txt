The contract in question may have the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable in the "endExecute" function is updated based on the balance of the contract at the end of execution, but it does not take into account any changes in the token balances during the execution process. This could lead to an inconsistent state if token balances change before the "endExecute" function is called.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The expression "getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount" in the "liquidate" function may lead to an arithmetic flaw if the calculations are not handled carefully, potentially resulting in incorrect liquidation decisions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "proposal" variable and the "votedProposal" function is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external parties.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Arithmetic flaw
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
