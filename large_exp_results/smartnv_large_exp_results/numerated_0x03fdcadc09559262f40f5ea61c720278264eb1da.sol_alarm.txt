The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() is updating the lockedFunds variable, but there is no indication of how this variable is being used or reassigned in the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer underflow in the liquidate() function where the calculation getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 might result in an underflow if the values are not carefully managed.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and integer overflow/underflow.
