Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update the state variables in certain functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

2) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during certain operations, which can result in the transaction failing or not being completed as intended.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of the functions and variables in the contract may not be properly set, leading to potential unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive information.
