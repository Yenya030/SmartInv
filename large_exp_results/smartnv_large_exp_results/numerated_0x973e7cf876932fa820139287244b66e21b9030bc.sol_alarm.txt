Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not define any of the required functions. This could lead to incorrect behavior or potential access control issues.
2) Atomicity violation: In the execute function, the transfer of tokens and updating of votedAmount are not done atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas to perform the required calculations, leading to the function being unable to execute properly.
4) Inconsistent state update: The endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract, but this update does not reflect the state of the contract accurately in certain scenarios.
