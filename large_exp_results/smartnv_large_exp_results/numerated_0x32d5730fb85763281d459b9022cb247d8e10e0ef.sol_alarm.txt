The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController declares `votingToken` as an internal variable, which means it can only be accessed within the contract and its derived contracts. This may limit the functionality or interaction with the contract.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the function `execute`, the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly by adding the transferred amount. This can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the same `proposal` at the same time.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may run out of gas if the loop statement `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` has to iterate through a large number of elements. This can result in the function not completing successfully.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities identified in the provided contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
