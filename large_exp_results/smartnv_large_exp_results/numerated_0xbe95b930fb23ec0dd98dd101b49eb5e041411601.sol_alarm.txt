The contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
         address public admin;
         uint public totalVotes;
         mapping(address => uint) public userVotes;
         
         constructor() {
             admin = msg.sender;
             totalVotes = 0;
         }
         
         function vote() public {
             totalVotes++;
             userVotes[msg.sender]++;
         }
         
         function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
             require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
             admin = newAdmin;
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- 2) Privilege escalation: The changeAdmin function allows any address to become the new admin if they call the function with the correct parameters, which could lead to privilege escalation.
- 7) ID uniqueness violation: The userVotes mapping uses the address of the voters as keys, which may lead to duplication or lack of uniqueness, causing potential issues with vote counting.
