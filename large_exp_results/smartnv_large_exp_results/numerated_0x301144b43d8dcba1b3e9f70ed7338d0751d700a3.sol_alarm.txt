The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities: 

contract VotingSystem {
     address public owner;
     mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
     uint public totalVotes;

     function vote() public {
          require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");
          hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
          totalVotes++;
     }

     function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can change the owner");
          owner = newOwner;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) privilege escalation
2) inconsistent state update
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
