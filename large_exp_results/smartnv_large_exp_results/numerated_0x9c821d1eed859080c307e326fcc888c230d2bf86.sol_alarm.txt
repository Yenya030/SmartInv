Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation - the owner variable is not properly managed, allowing potential privilege escalation.
2) inconsistent state update - there is a risk of inconsistent state updates in the execute and endExecute functions.
3) atomicity violation - there is a lack of atomicity in the execute function, where the transferFrom and state updates are not performed atomically.
4) ID uniqueness violation - there is no mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs in the Proposal struct.
5) incorrect visibility/ownership - the visibility of variables and functions may expose the contract to security threats.
