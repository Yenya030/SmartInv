Contract:

```solidity
contract PaymentProcessor {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function getBalance(address user) public view returns (uint) {
        return balances[user];
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not perform any checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow when handling balances.
2) Ether leakage: The contract transfers funds to users without checking for the success of the transfer, which may result in ether leakage.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas limits for certain operations, which may lead to potential out-of-gas errors.
4) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates balances without using the SafeMath library, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates in case of arithmetic overflows or underflows.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `balances` mapping is public, exposing sensitive user balance information to anyone. It might be a good practice to make this mapping private or restrict access to it.
