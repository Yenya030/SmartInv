Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` checks if the balance of the contract is sufficient for execution, but it does not consider the gas cost of the transactions, which may result in the execution failing due to insufficient gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, which could potentially lead to issues with ownership and access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
