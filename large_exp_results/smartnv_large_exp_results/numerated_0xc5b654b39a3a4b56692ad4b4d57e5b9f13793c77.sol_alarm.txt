The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "startExecute" function updates the state variable "proposal" without ensuring it is properly initialized. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility for an ownership variable. This could lead to ownership-related vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks the balance of the contract and the total supply of the token, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas and lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
