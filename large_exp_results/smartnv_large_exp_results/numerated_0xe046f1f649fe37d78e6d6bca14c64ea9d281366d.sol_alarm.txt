This is a contract you provided to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public userVotes;
    address public owner;

    function vote(uint256 numVotes) public {
        require(numVotes > 0, "Number of votes must be greater than 0");
        totalVotes += numVotes;
        userVotes[msg.sender] += numVotes;
    }

    function redeemVotes() public {
        require(userVotes[msg.sender] > 0, "No votes to redeem");
        totalVotes -= userVotes[msg.sender];
        userVotes[msg.sender] = 0;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to any address, potentially leading to privilege escalation if not properly restricted.

2) Inconsistent state update: The redeemVotes function updates the totalVotes and userVotes mapping independently, which could result in inconsistency if not properly managed.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The userVotes mapping uses addresses as keys, which could lead to ID uniqueness violation if multiple users have the same address.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which may expose sensitive information about the contract owner's address.
