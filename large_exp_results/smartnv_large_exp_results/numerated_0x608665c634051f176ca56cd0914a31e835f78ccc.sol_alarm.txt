Contract: TimelockController

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Privilege escalation: The startExecute function allows for any caller to initiate a new proposal, potentially leading to unauthorized proposal creation.
2) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function locks all the funds held by the contract without considering any conditions or validations, which could result in unexpected outcomes.
3) Inconsistent state update: The execute function increments the votedAmount of the proposal without updating the proposal state, which can lead to inconsistencies in the data.
4) Atomicity violation: The execute function involves multiple state changes without using proper synchronization mechanisms, risking inconsistent intermediate states.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of overflow in the votedAmount calculation in the execute function when multiple amounts are added together, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.
