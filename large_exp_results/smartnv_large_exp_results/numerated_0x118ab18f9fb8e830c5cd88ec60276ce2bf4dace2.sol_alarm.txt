Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation: The contract does not restrict access to certain functions based on privileges, allowing potential unauthorized users to call critical functions.
- Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state updates as multiple functions update the proposal struct without proper synchronization mechanisms.
- Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in operations such as transferring tokens and updating proposal variables, which could lead to unexpected behaviors.
- Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, there might be scenarios where the contract runs out of gas before completing certain operations, leading to incomplete or failed executions.
