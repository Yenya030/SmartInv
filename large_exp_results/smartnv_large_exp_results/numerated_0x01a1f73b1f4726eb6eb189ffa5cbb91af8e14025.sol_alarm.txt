The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update the state variables based on the execution flow, leading to potential inconsistencies.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the owner variable should be private or internal, which could lead to ownership/access control issues.
