Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without considering potential reentry attacks which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes without utilizing proper atomicity measures, which can result in partial execution of the function.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of certain functions or variables is not clearly defined, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical operations.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
