The contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        votes[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawVotes() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw votes");
        uint amount = votes[msg.sender];
        votes[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Output: 
1) privilege escalation
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
