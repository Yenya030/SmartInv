The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering any conditions related to its calculation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `startingBalanceList` variables are not specified with any visibility modifier, which could lead to incorrect access control and ownership issues.
