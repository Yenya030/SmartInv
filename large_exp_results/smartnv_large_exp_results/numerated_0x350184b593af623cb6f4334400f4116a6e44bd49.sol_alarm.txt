The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update:
- The function `startExecute()` updates the state variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are executed concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` variable, which can lead to potential accessibility issues and unintended modifications by external contracts.

Please ensure to address these vulnerabilities to enhance the security and integrity of the contract.
