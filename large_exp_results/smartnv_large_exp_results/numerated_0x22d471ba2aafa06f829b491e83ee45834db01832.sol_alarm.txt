The contract provided for analysis:

contract TradeContract {
     IERC20 public tokenA;
     IERC20 public tokenB;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     function trade(uint amountA, uint amountB) public {
         require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountA, "Insufficient balance for tokenA");
         require(tokenB.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountB, "Insufficient balance for tokenB");

         tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
         tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);

         balances[msg.sender] += amountA;
         balances[msg.sender] += amountB;
     }
}

Output: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "trade" updates the balances of the user by adding the amounts of tokenA and tokenB separately. It seems like there is a typo in incrementing balances as it should be adding amountB instead of amountA and using the assignment operator. This could lead to incorrect balance calculations for users.
2) Arithmetic flaw: There is a flaw in the calculation of balances, where both amounts (amountA and amountB) are added to the balances of the user without any check for potential overflow. Depending on the values of amounts, it could potentially cause an integer overflow if the total sum surpasses the maximum value of uint.
