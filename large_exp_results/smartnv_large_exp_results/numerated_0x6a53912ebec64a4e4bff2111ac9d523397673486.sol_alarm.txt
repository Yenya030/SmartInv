contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalVotes = 0;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
    
    function resetVotes() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can reset votes");
        totalVotes = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {

The potential vulnerabilities in the "VotingSystem" contract are:
3) business logic flaw - In the "resetVotes" function, the loop condition should be i < totalVotes instead of i < totalVotes, leading to a logical error.
7) ID uniqueness violation - There is a potential issue of ID uniqueness violation as it's possible for multiple addresses to vote from the same address due to the lack of verification of voter identity.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership - The variables "owner" and "totalVotes" are declared as public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties. A more secure practice would be to use internal or private visibility for these variables.
