Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling functions or accessing sensitive data. 
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple functions that update the state of the contract (e.g., proposal, startingBalanceList, lockedFunds) without proper synchronization or validation, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state. 
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations (e.g., proposal.votedAmount += amount) that are not properly checked for potential overflow or underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
