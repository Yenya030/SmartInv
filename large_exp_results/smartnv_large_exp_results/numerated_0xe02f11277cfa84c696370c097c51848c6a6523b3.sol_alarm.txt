The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract but does not provide a way to withdraw or utilize these funds, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute()`, `execute()`, and `endExecute()` functions are all declared as `external` which might expose internal state to external actors and can lead to unauthorized access to contract functions or data.
3) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate()` function uses multiplication and division without considering potential integer overflow or underflow risks.
4) Insufficient gas: The execution of complex operations in the `execute()` and `endExecute()` functions might consume more gas than expected, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
5) Suicidal contracts: There is no mechanism in place to prevent self-destructing the contract, potentially leading to a suicide attack.  

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, arithmetic flaw, insufficient gas, and suicidal contracts.
