Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no clear indication of how this variable is used or handled afterwards, which may lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is called without any visibility modifier specified, potentially leading to issues with access control and ownership.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the `votedProposal` function and the overall gas consumption, there might be a risk of running out of gas during execution, especially in cases where there are multiple token transfers involved.
4) ID uniqueness violation: It is not clear how unique IDs are handled within the contract, especially in scenarios where multiple proposals may be created and executed simultaneously. This could potentially lead to ID reuse and conflicts. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- ID uniqueness violation
