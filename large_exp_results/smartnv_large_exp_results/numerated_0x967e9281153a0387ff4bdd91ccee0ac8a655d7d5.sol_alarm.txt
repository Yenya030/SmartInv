Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
- Incorrect state update: The balance is updated directly in the deposit function without considering potential reentrancy issues.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The setBuyer and setSeller functions do not have any access control mechanism, allowing anyone to change the buyer or seller address.
- Ether leakage: In the withdraw function, the balance is transferred to the msg.sender before setting it to 0, which can potentially lead to ether leakage if the transfer fails after sending the balance.
