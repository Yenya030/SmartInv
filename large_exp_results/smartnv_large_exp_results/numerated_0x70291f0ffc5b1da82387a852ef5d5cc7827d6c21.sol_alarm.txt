Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the `proposal` struct in multiple functions without properly ensuring the consistency of the state.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might fail if there is not enough gas to complete the required operations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined as public, which could lead to visibility issues. Additionally, the ownership of the contract is not clearly defined.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping uses the `proposal.addr` as a key, which might lead to issues with ID uniqueness if the same address is used multiple times.
