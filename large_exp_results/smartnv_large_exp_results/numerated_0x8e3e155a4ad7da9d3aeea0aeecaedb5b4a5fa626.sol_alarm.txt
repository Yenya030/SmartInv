The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `proposal` struct is not specified, which could lead to potential data leakage.
- Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being modified in the functions without appropriate synchronization.
- Insufficient gas: It is possible that certain operations within the functions may require more gas than is available, leading to failures and vulnerabilities.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There are mathematical operations being performed without explicit checks for potential overflow or underflow.
