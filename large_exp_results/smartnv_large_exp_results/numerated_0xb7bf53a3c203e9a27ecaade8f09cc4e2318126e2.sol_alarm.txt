The contract presented contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any access control mechanisms, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to critical functions and data.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without properly checking if the previous vote was valid, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The integer calculations in the `liquidate` function could lead to integer overflow/underflow if not properly validated.
