Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable in the 'endExecute' function is updated without any proper validation or authorization checks, which may lead to unexpected behaviors.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the intended visibility or ownership control over the contract.
