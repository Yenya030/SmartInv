Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Integer overflow/underflow:
- In the "startExecute" function, the variable "startingBalance" is initialized but never used, which may lead to unexpected behavior in calculations involving this variable.

2) Inconsistent state update:
- In the "execute" function, the "votedAmount" of the proposal is updated without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define all required functions and variables, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities related to interface implementation.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to integer overflow/underflow, inconsistent state updates, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
