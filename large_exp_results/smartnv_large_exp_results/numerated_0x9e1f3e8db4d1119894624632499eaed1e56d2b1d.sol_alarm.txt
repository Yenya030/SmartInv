Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) The `owner` variable is not used or implemented in the contract, which may lead to privilege escalation if the owner functionalities are not properly enforced.
2) There is no check for price manipulation when tokens are bought, which could allow buyers to manipulate the amount of tokens they receive.
3) The contract does not have proper business logic in place to handle cases where the token balance is insufficient for a buy transaction.
4) The state update in the `buyTokens` function is not atomic, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are processed simultaneously.
5) There is potential for integer overflow/underflow in the `balance` mapping if large amounts of tokens are bought.
