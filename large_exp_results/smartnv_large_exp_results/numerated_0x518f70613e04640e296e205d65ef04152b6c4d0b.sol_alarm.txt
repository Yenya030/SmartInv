Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the proposal struct's fields without initializing the struct, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not demonstrate any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.
