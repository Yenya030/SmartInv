In the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potential exploitation by external contracts.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is modified directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, leading to a potential inconsistency in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially run out of gas if there are a large number of token holders in the voting system, which could result in the failure of the execution process.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
