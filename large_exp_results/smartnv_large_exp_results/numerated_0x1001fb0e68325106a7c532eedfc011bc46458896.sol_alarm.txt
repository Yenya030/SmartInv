The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the internal state variables "owner" and "votingToken" is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal struct is updated in the "startExecute" function, but there is no check to ensure that only one proposal can be active at a time, leading to potential inconsistencies in the proposal state.

3) Insufficient gas: In the "endExecute" function, the gas estimate for the execution may not be enough to complete the desired operations, leading to potential failures during execution.

Therefore, the contract contains the aforementioned vulnerabilities.
