The contract provided for analysis:

contract Lottery {
     address public owner;
     uint public secretNumber;
     mapping(address => uint) public userTickets;

     constructor() {
          owner = msg.sender;
          secretNumber = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % 1000;
     }

     function buyTicket(uint number) public payable {
          require(msg.value == 1 ether, "Ticket price must be 1 ether");
          require(number < 1000, "Number must be less than 1000");
          userTickets[msg.sender] = number;
     }

     function drawWinner() public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can draw the winner");
          uint winnerNumber = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % 1000;
          address winner;
          uint winningAmount = address(this).balance;
          if (winnerNumber == secretNumber) {
              winner = msg.sender;
              winner.transfer(winningAmount);
          }
     }
}

Output:
- The contract does not contain vulnerabilities.
