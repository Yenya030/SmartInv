Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `startingBalanceList` is being updated in the `startExecute` function without clear initialization or definition, which could lead to inconsistent state if not managed properly.

2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function performs a token transfer, which could potentially require significant gas. If not enough gas is provided when calling this function, the transfer may fail, leading to unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility modifiers for the struct `Proposal`, which could lead to accessibility and ownership issues if not properly managed.
