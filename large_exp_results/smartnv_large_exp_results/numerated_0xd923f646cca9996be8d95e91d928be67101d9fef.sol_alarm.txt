The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable without any further processing or checks. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled properly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The interface IERC20 is used, but it is unclear if the contract properly implements this interface. This could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues if not implemented correctly.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions involving this contract, there may be a risk of running out of gas during execution, leading to incomplete transactions or unexpected behavior.
