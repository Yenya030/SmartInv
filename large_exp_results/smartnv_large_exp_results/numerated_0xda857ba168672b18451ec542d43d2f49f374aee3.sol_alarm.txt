The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public price;
    uint public totalSold;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = IERC20(_token);
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= _amount * price, "Insufficient balance");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount * price);
        totalSold += _amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- insufficient gas 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
