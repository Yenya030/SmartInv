The contract you provided contains several potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without considering any existing proposals, which can lead to inconsistent data.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique IDs for proposals, which could result in conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to issues related to visibility or ownership management.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) ID uniqueness violation
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
