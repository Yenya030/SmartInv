Contract:
```solidity
contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            payable(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid);
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Reentrancy
2) Inconsistent state update
