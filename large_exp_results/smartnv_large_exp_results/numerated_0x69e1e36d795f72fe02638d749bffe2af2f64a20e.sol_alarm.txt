Based on the contract provided, potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state of the "proposal" struct in multiple functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas consumption properly, which may result in transactions failing due to insufficient gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of certain variables and functions, which may lead to unintended access or manipulation by external actors.

4) Business logic flaw: The contract logic for executing proposals and ending execution may have flaws that could lead to unexpected behavior or outcomes.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations performed in the contract that may be susceptible to integer overflow or underflow, potentially leading to unintended results. 

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not properly handle Ether transactions, which may result in unintended Ether leakage or loss. 

7) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include a mechanism to prevent self-destruct functions, which could make it susceptible to suicidal attacks.
