Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any proper check, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables `debt`, `collateral`, and `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract is public, which might expose sensitive information or functionalities to unauthorized parties.
