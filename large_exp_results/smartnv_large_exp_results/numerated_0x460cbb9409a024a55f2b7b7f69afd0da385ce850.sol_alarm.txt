The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;
    mapping(address => uint) public balance;

    function swapTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        balance[msg.sender] += amount;
        uint tokenBAmount = amount * 2;
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, tokenBAmount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The multiplication operation in the swapTokens function could potentially result in an integer overflow if the amount is large enough.
2) Inconsistent state update: The balance mapping is being updated after transferring tokens which could potentially lead to inconsistencies in the data.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balance mapping is public, which could expose sensitive user information.
