Potential vulnerabilities in the contract above:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the owner to execute functions that manipulate the state of the contract, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function sets the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring that it properly reflects the state of the contract. This could lead to incorrect accounting of funds.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which may allow unintended access by external contracts.
