Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure that proposals have unique identifiers, which could lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of certain variables and functions, which could potentially lead to unintended access or modification of sensitive data.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without verifying if the user has the required tokens to transfer, which could result in an inconsistent state if the transfer fails after the amount is updated.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply without providing enough gas for the operation, which could result in out-of-gas exceptions and failed execution.
