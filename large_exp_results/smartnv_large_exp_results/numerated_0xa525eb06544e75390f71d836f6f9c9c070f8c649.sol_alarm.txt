The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is:

```solidity
contract Insurance {
    address payable public beneficiary;
    uint public claimAmount;

    function setBeneficiary(address payable _beneficiary) public {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Only beneficiary can change beneficiary");
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
    }

    function fileClaim(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.value == amount, "Claim amount must match sent ether");
        beneficiary.transfer(amount);
        claimAmount = amount;
    }

    function withdrawClaim() public {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Only beneficiary can withdraw claim");
        msg.sender.transfer(claimAmount);
        claimAmount = 0;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in this contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
2) reentrancy
