The potential vulnerabilities in the contract below are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the variable "lockedFunds" is updated in the "endExecute" function which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables "startingBalanceList" and "proposal" is not specified, which could lead to incorrect access control and ownership-related issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
