Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function does not update the `proposal.sTime` to indicate that the execution has ended, potentially leading to confusion or incorrect state.
2) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit is not set high enough for the operations in the contract, certain functions like `execute` or `endExecute` that involve transferring tokens may fail due to running out of gas.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external contracts. Additionally, the ownership control mechanism is not clearly defined in the contract.
