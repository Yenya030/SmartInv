Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly without proper synchronization or checking, which may lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables "votingToken" and "proposal" is internal, which may not provide the intended level of access control or visibility.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions like "endExecute" if the gas limit is not set appropriately, potentially causing the transaction to fail.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce any uniqueness constraint on proposals, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals are created simultaneously.

5) Business logic flaw: The condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")" in the "endExecute" function may have unintended consequences and may not accurately reflect the desired business logic.
