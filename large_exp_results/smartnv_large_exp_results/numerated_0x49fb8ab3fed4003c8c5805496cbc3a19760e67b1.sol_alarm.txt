The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the state of the `proposal` struct without locking the state, potentially leading to inconsistent data if multiple calls try to update it simultaneously.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `lockedFunds` variable is used to store the balance of locked funds, but it is not clear how uniqueness of IDs or addresses is enforced in this context.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is being accessed and modified without proper access control mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functions.

4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the operations performed in the functions, there may be a risk of running out of gas, especially in the `endExecute` function where a loop is used to calculate the balance of `lockedFunds`.

5) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of locked funds is greater than half of the total token supply, which may not be a valid condition for executing the function based on the intended business logic.

6) Atomicity violation: The operations within the `startExecute` and `execute` functions are not wrapped in a transaction, potentially leading to partial execution of operations in case of failure.

7) Ether leakage: There are no explicit checks or mechanisms in place to prevent ether leakage in this contract, leaving it vulnerable to potential exploits.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, business logic flaw, atomicity violation, and ether leakage.
