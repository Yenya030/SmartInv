Contract in Analysis:
contract PaymentChannel {
    address public partyA;
    address public partyB;
    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _partyA, address _partyB, uint _amount) {
        partyA = _partyA;
        partyB = _partyB;
        amount = _amount;
    }

    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == partyA || msg.sender == partyB, "Only partyA or partyB can deposit funds");
        amount += _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == partyA || msg.sender == partyB, "Only partyA or partyB can withdraw funds");
        require(amount >= _amount, "Insufficient funds");
        amount -= _amount;
    }

    function closeChannel() public {
        selfdestruct(partyA);
    }
}
