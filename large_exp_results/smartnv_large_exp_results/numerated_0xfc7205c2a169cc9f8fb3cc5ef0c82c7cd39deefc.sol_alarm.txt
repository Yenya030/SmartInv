The contract to be analyzed:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        address previousBidder = highestBidder;
        uint previousBid = highestBid;
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
        if(previousBid > 0) {
            previousBidder.transfer(previousBid);
        }
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) reentrancy
2) inconsistent state update
