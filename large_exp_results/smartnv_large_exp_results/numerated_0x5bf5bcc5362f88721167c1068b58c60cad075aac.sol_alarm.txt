<\output\> 
The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentContract are:
1) Insufficient gas: The transfer function doesn't include a gas stipend for external calls, which could result in out-of-gas errors and failed transfers.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, potentially exposing sensitive information. Consider using private visibility for sensitive data.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check for integer overflow or underflow in the deposit, withdraw, and transfer functions, which could result in unexpected behavior if balances exceed uint256 limits.
