The following contract may contain potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBalanceList` without checking if the proposal already exists, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, which could lead to unintended access and modifications by external contracts.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
