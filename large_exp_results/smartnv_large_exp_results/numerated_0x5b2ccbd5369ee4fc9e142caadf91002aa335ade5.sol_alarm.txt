Contract TimelockController:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier. Without this, it may lead to conflicts or confusion if multiple proposals have the same ID.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal is updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data results.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not define the visibility of the variables 'lockedFunds' and 'startingBalanceList', which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of these sensitive data.

Overall, the TimelockController contract contains vulnerabilities such as ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state updates, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
