contract TokenSwap {

     function swap(uint amount, address recipient) public {
         require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance of Token A");

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the balances or perform any checks after the token transfer, which could lead to inconsistent state if the balances are not updated properly.
2) Insufficient gas: If the token transfers consume too much gas, the swap function may fail to complete successfully, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Depending on the intended access control, the visibility of the tokenA and tokenB variables may not be properly restricted, leading to potential unauthorized access to these variables.
