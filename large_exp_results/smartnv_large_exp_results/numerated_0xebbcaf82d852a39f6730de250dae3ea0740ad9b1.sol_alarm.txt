The contract provided contains potential vulnerabilities as follows:
1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function may have a logic flaw in determining the success of execution based only on the comparison of the balance of the contract against the total supply. This may lead to unintended behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `owner` variable is not specified. Depending on the access control requirements, this could potentially lead to unauthorized access.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include checks for handling gas limitations, which may lead to transaction failures or vulnerabilities.
