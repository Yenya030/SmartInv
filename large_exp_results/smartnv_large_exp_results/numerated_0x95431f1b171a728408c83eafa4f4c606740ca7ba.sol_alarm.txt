The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field of the `proposal` struct, but it does not reset this value after the proposal execution is completed, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility or ownership-related vulnerabilities depending on the intended design of the contract. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
