The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is as follows:

contract Escrow {
     address public buyer;
     address public seller;
     address public arbiter;

     enum State { Created, Locked, Released, Inactive }
     State public state;

     modifier onlyBuyer() {
         require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can call this function");
         _;
     }

     modifier inState(State _state) {
         require(state == _state, "Invalid state");
         _;
     }

     function deposit() public payable onlyBuyer {
         require(state == State.Created, "Invalid state");
     }

     function confirmReceived() public onlyBuyer inState(State.Locked) {
         state = State.Released;
         seller.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }

     function refundBuyer() public onlyBuyer inState(State.Locked) {
         state = State.Inactive;
         buyer.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }

     function refundSeller() public inState(State.Released) {
         state = State.Inactive;
         seller.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (seller and arbiter addresses are public)
- Insufficient gas for transfer functions
- Inconsistent state update in refundSeller function (updating state to Inactive without checking state)
- Potential reentrancy in transfer functions.
