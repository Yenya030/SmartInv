The contract potentially contains the following vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The function `startExecute()` updates the state variable `proposal` without checking if it conflicts with existing proposals. This can lead to unexpected behaviors if multiple proposals are started simultaneously. 

2) Atomicity violation: 
- The function `endExecute()` checks if the balance of tokens is sufficient for execution and then updates `lockedFunds`. This two-step process can result in a race condition where the balance changes between the check and update, leading to an inconsistent state. 

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but it does not specify the visibility of the functions from the interface, which can lead to potential access control issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
