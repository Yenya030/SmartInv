Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The mappings `hasVoted` and `voteCount` are public, which exposes sensitive voting information to anyone who accesses the contract.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function `vote` updates the `hasVoted` mapping and the `voteCount` mapping but in separate steps, potentially leading to inconsistent state if one update fails while the other succeeds.
3) Insufficient gas: If there are a large number of voters or the mappings grow too large, the function `vote` could run out of gas as it may require a significant amount of gas to update the mappings.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The use of `msg.sender` as the key in the mappings `hasVoted` and `voteCount` assumes that each address is unique, which may not always be the case.
5) Integer underflow: There is a risk of integer underflow in the `else` branch of the decision in the `vote` function when `voteCount[msg.sender]` is decremented.
