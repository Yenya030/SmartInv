The identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "proposal.votedAmount" is updated within the "execute" function, but there is no check to ensure that the "votedProposal" function is called before the update. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not have the required functions to fully comply with the interface, such as "transfer" and "balanceOf". This could lead to incorrect visibility and ownership control over token balances.

3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions explicitly, which could potentially lead to ether leakage if the contract inadvertently receives ether without the intended handling mechanism.

4) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks the balance of the contract using the "balanceOf" function, which could consume an excessive amount of gas if the contract holds a significant number of tokens. This could result in insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.
