The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated based on the balance of the contract, which can change due to external factors, leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is being called without being defined in the contract, potentially highlighting an issue with visibility or ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
