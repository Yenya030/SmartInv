Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any checks or validations, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if the conditions are not properly enforced.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions are all marked as `external`, which may expose them to potential attacks if they need to be accessed internally within the contract or by inheriting contracts. Consider using the `internal` visibility modifier instead.

3) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if `execution failed` based on the comparison of the half of the balance of the contract against the total supply, which may not be an accurate measure of success or failure, potentially leading to incorrect decisions. Review the logic for determining successful execution carefully.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Business logic flaw
