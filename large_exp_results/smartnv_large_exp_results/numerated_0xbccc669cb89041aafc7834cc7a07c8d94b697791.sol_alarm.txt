Contract:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;
    bool public buyerApproved;
    bool public sellerApproved;

    function deposit(address _arbiter) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit funds");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount should be greater than 0");
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = msg.value;
    }

    function approve(bool _buyerApproved) public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "Only buyer or seller can approve");
        if (msg.sender == buyer) {
            buyerApproved = _buyerApproved;
        } else {
            sellerApproved = _buyerApproved;
        }
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(sellerApproved == true, "Seller has not approved release of funds");
        require(buyerApproved == true, "Buyer has not approved release of funds");
        uint transferAmount = amount;
        recipient = seller;
        seller.transfer(transferAmount);
    }
}

Output: 
Business logic flaw
Inconsistent state update
