The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has functions like startExecute and endExecute that update the state of the proposal struct in a way that may lead to inconsistencies.

2) Insufficient gas: If the contract performs complex operations or requires a high amount of gas, there is a possibility of running out of gas during execution.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which might lead to unexpected behavior if not properly controlled.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
