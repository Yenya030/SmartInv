The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities:

contract MyContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint => bool) usedIDs;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setID(uint id) public {
        require(!usedIDs[id], "ID already used");
        usedIDs[id] = true;
    }

    function updateOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        // Withdraw funds here
    }

    function calculate(uint x, uint y) public pure returns (uint) {
        return x * y;
    }
}

Output:
1) ID uniqueness violation
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
