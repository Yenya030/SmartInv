Contract to be analyzed:

contract PaymentEscrow {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit(address _to, uint _amount) public {
        require(_to != address(0), "Cannot deposit to zero address");
        balances[_to] += _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}

Output: 
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not check for uniqueness of addresses before allowing deposits, potentially leading to conflicts or overwrites in the balances mapping.
- Inconsistent state update: The balances mapping is updated directly without using safe arithmetic operations, leaving room for integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, allowing anyone to view the balances of all addresses, which could reveal sensitive information.
