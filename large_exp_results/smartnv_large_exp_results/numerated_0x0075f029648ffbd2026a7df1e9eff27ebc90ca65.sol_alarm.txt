The contract provided for analysis:

<\contract_to_analyze\>
contract VotingSystem {
    uint public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => uint) public userVotes;

    function vote(uint _amount) external {
        require(_amount > 0, "Invalid vote amount");
        totalVotes += _amount;
        userVotes[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }

    function revokeVote(uint _amount) external {
        require(userVotes[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient votes to revoke");
        totalVotes -= _amount;
        userVotes[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}
<\contract_to_analyze\>

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow/underflow in the totalVotes variable and userVotes mapping if the vote or revokeVote functions are called with a large or negative value.
2) Inconsistent state update: The totalVotes and userVotes variables are updated independently in the vote and revokeVote functions, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.
3) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of the vote or revokeVote functions, the state changes may not be completed successfully.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The totalVotes and userVotes variables are public, which allows anyone to view the total votes and individual user votes, potentially compromising privacy.
