The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without any protection or checks, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables WETH, USDC, and pair in the ExchangeTokens contract are declared as public, which exposes sensitive information about these variables to all users on the blockchain. This can lead to security risks and potential exploits if these variables are manipulated by unauthorized users. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
