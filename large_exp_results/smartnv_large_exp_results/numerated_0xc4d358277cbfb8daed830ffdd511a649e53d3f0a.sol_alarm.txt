Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the "proposal" and "startingBalanceList" variables, which could potentially lead to unexpected access or manipulation of data by external contracts.

2) inconsistent state update: In the "execute" function, the "proposal.votedAmount" is incremented without any check for whether the transaction was successful. This could lead to an inconsistent state if the transfer in "votingToken.transferFrom" fails.

3) insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks the balance of the contract against the total supply of the token, which could potentially require a large amount of gas if the total supply is significantly large.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
