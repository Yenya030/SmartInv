potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks or mechanisms in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs, which could lead to conflicts or errors in using IDs.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of consideration for handling gas costs or gas limits in the functions, which could result in failed transactions or unexpected behavior.
