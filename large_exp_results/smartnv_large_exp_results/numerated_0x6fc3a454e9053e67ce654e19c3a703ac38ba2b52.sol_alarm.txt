The contract below has the following potential vulnerabilities: 
1) The function endExecute() lacks proper access control which can lead to privilege escalation.
2) The execute() function does not handle reentrancy properly.
3) The endExecute() function performs arithmetic calculations and comparisons based on token balances which may be susceptible to integer overflow/underflow or arithmetic flaws.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) privilege escalation
2) reentrancy
3) integer overflow/underflow
4) arithmetic flaw

Overall, the contract may need further review and updates to address these potential vulnerabilities.
