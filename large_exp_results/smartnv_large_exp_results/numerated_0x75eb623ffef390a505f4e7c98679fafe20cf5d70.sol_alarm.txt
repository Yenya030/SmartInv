The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `internal owner` variable is not used or enforced anywhere in the contract, potentially leading to issues related to ownership control. 

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of functions like `execute`, it may result in incomplete or failed transactions. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
