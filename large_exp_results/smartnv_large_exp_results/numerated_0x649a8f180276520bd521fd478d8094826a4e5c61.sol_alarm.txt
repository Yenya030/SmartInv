The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function ```startExecute()``` updates the proposal state without handling multiple proposals simultaneously, which can lead to inconsistent state data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is set to internal visibility, which may not be intended and could result in unexpected access control issues.
