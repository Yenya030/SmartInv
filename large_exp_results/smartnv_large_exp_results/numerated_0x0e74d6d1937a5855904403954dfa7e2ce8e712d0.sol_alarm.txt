The potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract are:
1) Price manipulation: The price of the product is set by the seller when creating a new product, allowing potential price manipulation.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'products' mapping is public, exposing product details to anyone, which may not be intended.
