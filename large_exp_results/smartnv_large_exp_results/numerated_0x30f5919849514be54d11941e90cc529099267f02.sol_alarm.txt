Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not consider the scenario where the token transfer fails. This could result in an inconsistent state if the transfer fails after updating the `lockedFunds` variable.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs multiple state changes and token transfers in a single transaction, which may require a significant amount of gas. If the gas limit set for the transaction is insufficient, the transaction may fail midway, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Privilege escalation: The contract allows a user to start, execute, and end proposals without proper access control mechanisms in place. This lack of privilege escalation control could lead to unauthorized users initiating or manipulating proposals.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and privilege escalation.
