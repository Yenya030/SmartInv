contract VotingSystem {
    uint public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;

    function getTotalVotes() public view returns (uint) {
        return totalVotes;

} 

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of voter IDs, which may lead to multiple votes from the same address.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables totalVotes and hasVoted are public, which may expose sensitive information and allow unauthorized access or modification.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state updates if multiple votes are made concurrently, as there is no locking mechanism in place.
4) Insufficient gas: If the totalVotes exceeds the gas limits, the contract may fail to execute properly.
5) Atomicity violation: The operations within the vote function are not atomic, which may lead to unexpected behavior in case of failures during execution.
