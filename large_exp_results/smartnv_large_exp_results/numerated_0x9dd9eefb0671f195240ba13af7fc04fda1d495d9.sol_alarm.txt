The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility: The functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() are currently marked as external, which makes them externally accessible. Depending on the intended functionality, it may be necessary to change the visibility of these functions to internal or public.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated within the functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute(). It is important to ensure that the state changes are correctly sequenced and do not lead to inconsistent states.

3) Potential business logic flaw: The execution logic in the endExecute() function may not achieve the desired outcome as the check "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" appears to be checking for an arbitrary condition that might not align with the intended business logic.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Potential business logic flaw
