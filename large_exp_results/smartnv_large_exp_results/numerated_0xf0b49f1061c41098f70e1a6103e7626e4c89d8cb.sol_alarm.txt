Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation (no check for duplicate proposals)
2) Integer overflow/underflow in execute function (in case votedAmount exceeds uint256 max value)
3) Incorrect visibility in proposal struct (should be public for proper interaction)
4) Insufficient gas in execute function that might result in failed execution
5) Atomicity violation in execute function as votedAmount manipulation is not atomic
