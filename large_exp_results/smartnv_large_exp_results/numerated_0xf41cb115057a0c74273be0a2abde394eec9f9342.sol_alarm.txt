Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of proposal but does not validate if the proposal is already in progress, potentially allowing multiple proposals to be started simultaneously.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: The variables startingBalance and proposal.votedAmount are incremented without checking for potential integer overflow/underflow issues.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may allow external contracts to access or modify its value. Consider using private or external visibility instead.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function performs a check on the balance of the contract, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors. Consider optimizing gas usage in this function.
