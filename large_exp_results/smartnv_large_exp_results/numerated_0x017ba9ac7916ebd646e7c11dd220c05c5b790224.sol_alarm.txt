The contract to analyze:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    uint public price;
    bool public isPaid;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, uint _price) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        price = _price;
        isPaid = false;
    }

    function pay() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can pay");
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        isPaid = true;
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can release funds");
        require(isPaid == true, "Payment has not been made");
        payable(seller).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function cancel() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can cancel the transaction");
        require(isPaid == false, "Payment has already been made");
        selfdestruct(payable(buyer));
    }
}

Output: 
1) atomicity violation
2) inconsistent state update
