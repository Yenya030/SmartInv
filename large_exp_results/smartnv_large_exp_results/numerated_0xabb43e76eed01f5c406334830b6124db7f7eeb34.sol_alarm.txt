    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        balance += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
