The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state but also updates the `startingBalanceList` state in the same function call. This can lead to inconsistencies if one state update fails and the other one succeeds.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which means it can only be accessed within the contract and its derived contracts. This might be an issue if external contracts need to access this variable.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `Proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier for each proposal. This could lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are created at the same time.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the transactions within the function. This can leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions explicitly, which could lead to unintended ether transfers or loss if not handled carefully.

6) Suicidal contracts: There is no mechanism in place to prevent the contract from self-destructing or being destroyed by an external entity.

7) Atomicity violation: The `startExecute` function and `execute` function perform multiple state changes without using any sort of locking mechanism to ensure atomicity and prevent race conditions.

8) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations performed in the contract that can potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, ID uniqueness violation, insufficient gas, ether leakage, suicidal contracts, atomicity violation, and integer overflow/underflow.
