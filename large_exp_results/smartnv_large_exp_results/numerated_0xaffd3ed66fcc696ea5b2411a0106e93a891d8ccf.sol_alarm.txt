Contract being analyzed: 

contract Vesting {
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public cliff;
    uint public start;
    uint public duration;
    uint public released;
    mapping(address => uint) public vestedAmount;

    constructor(address _beneficiary, uint _cliff, uint _start, uint _duration) public {
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        cliff = _cliff;
        start = _start;
        duration = _duration;
    }

    function release() public {
        require(block.timestamp >= start + cliff, "Cliff period has not passed");
        uint releasable = vestedAmount[msg.sender] - released;
        require(releasable > 0, "No funds to release");
        require(block.timestamp >= start + duration, "Vesting duration has not ended");
        released = released + releasable;
        // Transfer funds to beneficiary
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
