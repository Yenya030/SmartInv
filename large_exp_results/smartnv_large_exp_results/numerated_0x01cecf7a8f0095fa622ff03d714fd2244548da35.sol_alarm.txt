The contract in question is:

contract PaymentChannel {
     address public payer;
     address public payee;
     uint public expiration;
     uint public value;

     constructor(address _payer, address _payee, uint _expiration) public payable {
          payer = _payer;
          payee = _payee;
          expiration = _expiration;
          value = msg.value;
     }

     function closeChannel(uint256 amount, bytes memory signature) public {
         require(msg.sender == payee, "only payee can close the channel");
         require(amount <= value, "amount exceeds channel value");
         require(now < expiration, "channel has expired");

         payee.transfer(amount);
         selfdestruct(payer);
     }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
