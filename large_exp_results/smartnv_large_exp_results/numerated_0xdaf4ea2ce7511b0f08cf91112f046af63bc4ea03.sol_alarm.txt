The provided contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update:
- In the function `startExecute()`, the `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` is being updated without initializing the `startingBalanceList` mapping. This could lead to inconsistent state if the mapping is not properly initialized.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract is implementing the interface `IERC20` but does not fully implement all the required functions, which could lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect all functions from the interface to be implemented.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
