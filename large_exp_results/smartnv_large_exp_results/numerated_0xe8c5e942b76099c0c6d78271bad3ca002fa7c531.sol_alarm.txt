The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or atomicity checks.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not specified with a visibility modifier, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities in managing the access control and ownership of the contract.
