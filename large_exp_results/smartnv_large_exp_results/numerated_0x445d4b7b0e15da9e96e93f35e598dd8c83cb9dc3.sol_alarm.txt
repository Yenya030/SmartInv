    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter) public payable {
        buyer = msg.sender;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = msg.value;
    }

    function releaseAmountToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
        seller.transfer(amount);
    }

    function refundAmountToBuyer() public {
