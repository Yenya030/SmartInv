The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for updating the state of the proposal in the 'execute' function by incrementing the 'votedAmount', but it does not update the state of the proposal in the 'endExecute' function. This can lead to inconsistent state representation.

2) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function relies on the gas estimation for the transfer operation, which can potentially fail if the gas provided is insufficient for the transaction.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the 'lockedFunds' variable, which can lead to potential issues with ownership or visibility control.

Overall, the contract may need further review and modifications to address these vulnerabilities.
