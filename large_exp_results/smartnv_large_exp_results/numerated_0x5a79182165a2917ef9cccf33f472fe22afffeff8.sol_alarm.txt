Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to potential issues with access control.
- Inconsistent state update: The state variables "proposal.votedAmount" and "lockedFunds" are updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: The function "endExecute()" performs a potentially expensive operation by checking if the balance is twice the total supply, which may require more gas than available in a typical transaction.
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal IDs, potentially leading to confusion or manipulation of proposals.
