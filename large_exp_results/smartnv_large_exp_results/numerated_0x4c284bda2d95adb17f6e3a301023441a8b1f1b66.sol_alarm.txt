The contract provided is:

contract PaymentSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentSystem contract:
- Integer overflow/underflow in the balances mapping when adding or subtracting values.
- Insufficient gas for the withdrawal function, which may lead to funds being stuck in the contract.
