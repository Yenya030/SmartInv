Contract analysis:
contract ERC20Token {
     address public owner;
     string public name;
     uint256 public totalSupply;
     mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

     constructor(string memory _name, uint256 _initialSupply) public {
         owner = msg.sender;
         name = _name;
         totalSupply = _initialSupply;
         balances[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;
     }

     function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
         balances[_to] += _amount;
     }

     function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
         require(balances[_from] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Must be owner to transferFrom");
         balances[_from] -= _amount;
         balances[_to] += _amount;
     }

     function burn(uint256 _amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
         totalSupply -= _amount;
         balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is public, potentially exposing sensitive ownership information.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to ensure unique identifiers for addresses in the mapping, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Reentrancy: The transferFrom function does not include any checks or mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks.
4) Insufficient gas: The burn function does not include any gas stipend, which could result in out-of-gas errors during execution.
5) Inconsistent state update: The burn function updates the totalSupply and balances without ensuring atomicity, which could result in inconsistent state.
