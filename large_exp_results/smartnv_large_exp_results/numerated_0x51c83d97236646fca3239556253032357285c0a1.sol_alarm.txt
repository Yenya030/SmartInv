The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is potential for inconsistent state update with the "votedAmount" in the execute function. If multiple transactions execute this function concurrently, it could result in the value being updated incorrectly.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the required calculations and checks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
