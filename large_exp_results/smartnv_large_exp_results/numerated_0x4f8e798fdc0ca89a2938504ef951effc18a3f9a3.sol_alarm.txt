Contract you are going to analyze:

contract PaymentGateway {
     address public admin;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;
     
     constructor() {
         admin = msg.sender;
     }
     
     function deposit() public payable {
         balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }
     
     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
     }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) insufficient gas
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
