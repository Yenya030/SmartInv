Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function modifies the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state-changing operations without wrapping them in a single transaction, which could result in atomicity violations.
3) Reentrancy: The `execute` function calls `votingToken.transferFrom`, an external call that could potentially be manipulated by malicious contracts to perform reentrancy attacks.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals share the same ID.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which could lead to accessibility issues and potentially unauthorized access to critical functions or variables.
