Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount without using proper synchronization or atomic operations, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: If the execution of the endExecute function requires a significant amount of gas due to the condition checking the balance, it may fail to complete successfully, leading to insufficient gas vulnerability.
