The contract in question:

contract Vault {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        balance += _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
        require(_amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= _amount;
    }
}

- ID uniqueness violation
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
