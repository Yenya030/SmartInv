<\contract\> 
contract Payment {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function pay(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        
        // Vulnerability: Business logic flaw - allows the user to withdraw more than their balance
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
