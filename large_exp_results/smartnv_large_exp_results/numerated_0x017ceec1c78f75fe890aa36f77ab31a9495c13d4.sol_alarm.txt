Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws within the functions that handle transaction submissions, confirmations, executions, revocations, and changes in requirements.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of some functions and variables may not be properly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or unintended behaviors.
