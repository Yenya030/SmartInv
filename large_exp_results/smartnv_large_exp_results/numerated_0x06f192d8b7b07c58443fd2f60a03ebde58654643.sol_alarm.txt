Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without proper checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may lead to visibility issues and potential ownership vulnerabilities.
