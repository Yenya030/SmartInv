The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as the condition for liquidation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount) may be incorrect or insufficient.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The WETH and USDC variables in the ExchangeTokens contract are marked as public, which exposes these variables to all users. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of these variables.
