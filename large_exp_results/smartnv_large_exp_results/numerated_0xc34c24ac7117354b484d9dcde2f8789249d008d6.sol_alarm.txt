The contract you provided for analysis contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state variable `proposal` without initializing it first, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20`, but not all functions are implemented as required by the interface. This could lead to incorrect visibility of functions and ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a gas-intensive operation inside a require statement, which could potentially lead to insufficient gas for the transaction to be executed successfully.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
