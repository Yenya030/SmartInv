<\output\>
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract allows multiple votes from the same address without checking for uniqueness.
- Inconsistent state update: The function resetVotes can potentially reset the totalVotes without any validation or restrictions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- Integer overflow: If the totalVotes reaches the maximum limit for a uint256 variable and further votes are cast, an integer overflow can occur.
