Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation - The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling sensitive functions.
2) inconsistent state update - The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without checking if the caller has already voted, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
3) atomicity violation - The `execute` function does not ensure that all state changes can be executed atomically, leaving room for unexpected behavior if an error occurs midway.
4) ID uniqueness violation - There is no uniqueness check for the `proposal.addr`, which could lead to issues if duplicate addresses are used.
5) incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility of the `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables is not specified, potentially exposing sensitive information publicly.
