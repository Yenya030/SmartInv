Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state of `proposal` without checking if there is an existing proposal, leading to a potential inconsistent state issue.
2) Privilege escalation: The `proposal` struct is not properly defined in terms of access control, potentially allowing unauthorized users to manipulate the proposal data.
