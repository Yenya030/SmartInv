The contract above contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is being updated in the 'endExecute' function without any validation or check, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' and 'startingBalanceList' variables are accessed directly within the contract without specifying visibility (e.g., public, private), which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.
