Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which may lead to unintended access and manipulation of contract state by external entities.

2) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how this state variable is used or managed throughout the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes (transfer of tokens, updating proposal state), which can potentially lead to race conditions and atomicity violations if not properly handled.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or incorrect processing of multiple proposals with the same ID.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions explicitly, which may result in unintended Ether transfers or leakage if not properly managed.

6) Insufficient gas: The contract's functions may require different amounts of gas for execution, which could result in functions failing due to insufficient gas provided by the user. Proper gas estimation and handling should be implemented to avoid this vulnerability.
