This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
- ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or other entities within the contract. This could lead to confusion or conflicts in the data.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables should be carefully considered to ensure that sensitive data and functionality are appropriately restricted. Without proper visibility settings, unauthorized access or manipulation may occur.
