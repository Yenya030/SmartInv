The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Purchase {
    uint public totalSupply = 1000;
    address public owner;

    function buyTokens(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount has to be greater than 0");
        totalSupply -= amount;
        transferTokens(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function transferTokens(address recipient, uint amount) internal {
        totalSupply -= amount;
        // Transfer tokens to the recipient
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function buyTokens() and transferTokens() both update the totalSupply without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent state.

2) Integer underflow: If the amount passed to buyTokens() function exceeds the totalSupply, it may cause an integer underflow issue.

3) Ownership control: There is no mechanism in place to control or manage the ownership of the contract, which can lead to unauthorized access and control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Integer underflow, and Ownership control.
