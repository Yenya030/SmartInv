Contract Analysis:

The contract provided for analysis: 

contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint) public voteBalance;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        voteBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawVotes(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(voteBalance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient vote balance");
        voteBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address _newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
        admin = _newAdmin;
    }
}

Output: 
- privilege escalation: The `changeAdmin` function allows the current admin to change the administrator address, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of voter addresses, which could lead to issues if multiple votes are cast from the same address.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` state variable is publicly visible, which may expose sensitive information. The ownership control is based solely on the address that deployed the contract, which could be improved for better security.
