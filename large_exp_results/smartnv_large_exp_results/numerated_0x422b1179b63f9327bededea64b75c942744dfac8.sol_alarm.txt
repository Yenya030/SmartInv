For the contract provided:

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is no logic to ensure that the variables `votedAmount` and `votedProposal` are updated consistently within the `execute` function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions are not specifying any visibility (public, external, etc.), which can lead to potential security issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require excessive gas to execute if the `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` condition is met with a large number.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculations within the `liquidate` function, which may result in unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Insufficient gas, Integer overflow/underflow.
