Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the `votingToken` variable, which can lead to potential issues with ownership and access control.
- Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using safe arithmetic operations, which can potentially lead to inconsistent state updates and vulnerabilities.
- Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function requires that the contract has enough gas to execute the logic within the block, which can lead to potential issues if the gas limit is not set appropriately.
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not provide any mechanisms to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to potential conflicts and vulnerabilities.
- Suicidal contracts: The contract does not contain any protection mechanisms against self-destruct actions, which can lead to the contract being destructed maliciously.
- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, which can potentially lead to ether leakage vulnerabilities.
