Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The function `liquidate` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract updates the `debt` and `collateral` mappings without proper validation or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Arithmetic flaw: The calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate` function may result in an arithmetic flaw, leading to unexpected results or vulnerabilities.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract is marked as public but updates state variables directly, which might not be intended. Consider adjusting the function visibility or ownership based on the contract's functionalities.
