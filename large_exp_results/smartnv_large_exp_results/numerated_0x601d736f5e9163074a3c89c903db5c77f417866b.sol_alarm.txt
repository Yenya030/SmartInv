contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _price) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        price = _price;
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "You are not authorized to release funds");
        payable(seller).transfer(price);
    }

    function refundFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == arbiter, "You are not authorized to refund funds");
        payable(buyer).transfer(price);
