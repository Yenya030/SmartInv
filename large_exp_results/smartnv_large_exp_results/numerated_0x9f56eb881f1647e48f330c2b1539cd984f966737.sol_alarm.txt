The contract you provided does contain potential vulnerabilities. Here are the identified vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a condition that checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply of the token. However, this condition might not guarantee a correct and consistent update of the `lockedFunds` variable.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract may face a vulnerability due to insufficient gas as the `execute()` function may consume a significant amount of gas, especially if executed multiple times or in scenarios where gas fees are high.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
