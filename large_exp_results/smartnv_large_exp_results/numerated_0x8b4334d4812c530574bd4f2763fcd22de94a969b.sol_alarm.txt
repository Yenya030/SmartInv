The potential vulnerabilities in the contract VotingSystem could be:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state of whether an address has voted or not is updated directly in the vote function without considering potential reentrancy or other scenarios.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no uniqueness check for the proposalId, which may lead to vote count inaccuracies.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the hasVoted mapping and votesReceived mapping being public may expose sensitive information and lead to unauthorized access.
