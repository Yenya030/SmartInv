The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount * price, "Insufficient token balance");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    }

    function setPrice(uint _newPrice) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set the price");
        price = _newPrice;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `setPrice` function should have the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to only the owner of the contract.
2) Insufficient gas: If the contract's token balance becomes very large, it may cause an out-of-gas error when checking `token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount * price` in the `buyTokens` function.
3) Business logic flaw: The `buyTokens` function should deduct tokens from the buyer's account and calculate the final amount to transfer based on the current price, rather than relying on the buyer specifying the exact amount of tokens to purchase. 
4) Integer overflow/underflow: The multiplication in `token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount * price` could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the product exceeds the maximum uint value.
