7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to have any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals.

10) Arithmetic flaw: The function `calculatePrice()` in the contract might encounter an arithmetic flaw if the calculation returns unexpected or incorrect results due to the nature of the division operation being performed.

Additionally, there may be other vulnerabilities present in the contract that are not explicitly mentioned in the examples provided.
