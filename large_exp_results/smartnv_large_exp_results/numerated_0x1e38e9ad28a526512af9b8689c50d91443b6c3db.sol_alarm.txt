The contract provided for analysis is:

contract ExampleContract {
    address public owner;

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- privilege escalation
- incorrect ownership
- inconsistent state update
