The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:

<\contract\>
contract PaymentGateway {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
<\contract\>

The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentGateway contract are:
1) reentrancy vulnerability
2) incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability
