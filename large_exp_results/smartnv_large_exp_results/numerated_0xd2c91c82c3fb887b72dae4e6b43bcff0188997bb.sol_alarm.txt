The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Vault {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender != owner, "Owner cannot deposit");
        balance += _amount;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        require(_amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= _amount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Privilege escalation
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
