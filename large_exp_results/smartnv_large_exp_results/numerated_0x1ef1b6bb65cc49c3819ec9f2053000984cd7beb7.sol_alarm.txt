Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks access control mechanisms to restrict functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute to authorized users only.
2) Inconsistent state update: The variables proposal.sTime, proposal.votedAmount are being updated without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies.
3) Inconsistent state update: The assignment of startingBlance to startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] may lead to inconsistent state if startingBlance is not properly calculated.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable and the lack of proper ownership control could result in unauthorized access to critical functions and data.
