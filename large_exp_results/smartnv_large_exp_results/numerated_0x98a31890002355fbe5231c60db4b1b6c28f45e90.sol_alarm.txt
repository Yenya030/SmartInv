Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling certain functions.
2) inconsistent state update: The state variables like `proposal.votedAmount` are updated without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies.
3) integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of checks for potential overflow or underflow in integer operations like `proposal.votedAmount += amount`.
4) atomicity violation: Multiple state changes are made within a single function without using proper atomic operations.
5) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain functions and state variables may not be set correctly, potentially leading to security issues.
