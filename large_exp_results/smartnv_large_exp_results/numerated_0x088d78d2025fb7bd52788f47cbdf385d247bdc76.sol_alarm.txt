The contract under analysis is:
```
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public price;
    address payable public beneficiary;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price, address payable _beneficiary) {
        token = _token;
        price = _price;
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect amount");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        beneficiary.transfer(msg.value);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Arithmetic flaw: In the `buyTokens` function, the calculation `msg.value == amount * price` could potentially lead to arithmetic flaws if the price or amount values are manipulated.
2) Ether leakage: Transferring `msg.value` directly to the `beneficiary` without additional checks or safeguards can potentially lead to ether leakage.
3) Insufficient gas: If the `buyTokens` function consumes a large amount of gas, it could potentially result in insufficient gas for the transaction to be completed successfully.
