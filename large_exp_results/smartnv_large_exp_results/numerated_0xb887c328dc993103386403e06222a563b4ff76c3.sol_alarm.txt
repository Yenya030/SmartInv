Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not define any of the required functions specified in the interface. This could lead to issues with visibility and ownership of functions.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in multiple functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) without proper consideration for state consistency, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function relies on the contract having enough gas to perform the necessary operations, such as transferring tokens. If the gas limit is not enough, the function may fail and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

4) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract perform multiple state changes without using any mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which could lead to vulnerabilities related to inconsistent or incomplete state changes.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions explicitly and could potentially lead to unintentional Ether leakage, especially if other contracts interact with it in unexpected ways.

6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses addresses as identifiers (e.g., `proposal.addr`) without ensuring uniqueness, which could lead to vulnerabilities related to mistaken identity or conflicting data.

7) Arithmetic flaw: The `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract performs arithmetic operations without explicitly handling potential arithmetic flaws like overflow or underflow, which could lead to vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
