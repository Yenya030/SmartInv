The contract you are going to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
         struct Voter {
              uint256 weight;
              bool voted;
              address delegate;
              uint256 vote;
              string name;
          }
          mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
          address public admin;
          bool public votingStarted;

          function startVoting() external {
               require(msg.sender == admin, "only admin can start voting");
               votingStarted = true;
          }

          function delegate(address _to) external {
              require(voters[msg.sender].voted == false, "you already voted");
              voters[msg.sender].delegate = _to;
          }

          function castVote(uint256 _vote, string memory _name) external {
               Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
               require(sender.voted == false, "already voted.");
               sender.voted = true;
               sender.vote = _vote;
               sender.name = _name;
          }

          function endVoting() external {
               require(votingStarted == true, "voting hasn't started");
               // Calculate results and declare winner
          }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the VotingSystem contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, which exposes it to potential manipulation by external parties. It should be set as private and have appropriate access control mechanisms.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of voter addresses, which could lead to issues if multiple voters have the same address.
3) Business logic flaw: The contract lacks a comprehensive mechanism for counting and verifying votes, which could result in inaccurate or manipulated voting results.
4) Privilege escalation: There is no check to ensure that only the admin can call the startVoting function, potentially allowing unauthorized users to start the voting process.
