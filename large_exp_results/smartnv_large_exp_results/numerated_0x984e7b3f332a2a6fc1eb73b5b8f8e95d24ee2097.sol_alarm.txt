This contract potentially contains the following vulnerabilities:

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
13) Insufficient gas: The functions within the contract do not consider the gas limit for transaction executions, which could result in transactions failing due to running out of gas.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables within the contract may not be properly defined, leading to potential security risks.
