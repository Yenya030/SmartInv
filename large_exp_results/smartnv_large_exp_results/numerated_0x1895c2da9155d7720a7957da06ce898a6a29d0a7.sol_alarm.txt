The contract to analyze:

contract TokenSale {
         IERC20 public token;
         address public beneficiary;
         address public admin;
         uint public tokenPrice;
         uint public tokensSold;

         constructor(IERC20 _token, address _beneficiary, uint _tokenPrice) public {
             token = _token;
             beneficiary = _beneficiary;
             admin = msg.sender;
             tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
             tokensSold = 0;
         }

         function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
             require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Incorrect token amount");
             require(token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount), "Token transfer failed");
             tokensSold += _amount;
         }

         function withdrawTokens() public {
             require(msg.sender == beneficiary || msg.sender == admin, "Unauthorized");
             require(token.transfer(beneficiary, token.balanceOf(address(this))), "Token transfer failed");
         }
  }

Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `withdrawTokens` function allows both the beneficiary and the admin to withdraw tokens. However, the admin may not have the authorization to withdraw tokens, which could lead to unauthorized access to funds.
- Insufficient gas: If the `buyTokens` function requires a significant amount of gas to execute, users may run out of gas midway through the transaction, leading to a failed transaction and a potential loss of funds.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is no explicit check for integer overflow/underflow in the contract, which could lead to unexpected behavior if large values are passed to functions that perform arithmetic operations.
