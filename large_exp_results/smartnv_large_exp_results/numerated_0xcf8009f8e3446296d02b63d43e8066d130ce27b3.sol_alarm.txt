Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the proposal's votedAmount in the execute function without using safe math operations, which can lead to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is being used as the base contract for TimelockController, which may not be intended and can lead to incorrect ownership and visibility issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a check on the balance comparison with multiplication, which can consume excessive gas and potentially lead to an out-of-gas error.
4) Atomicity violation: The endExecute function has multiple require statements that need to be executed atomically for the correct functioning of the contract, potentially leading to atomicity violation vulnerabilities.
