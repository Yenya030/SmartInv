The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `votingToken`, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the total balance of `votingToken`, which may not accurately reflect the locked funds as it does not consider potential transfers or changes in the token balance during execution.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function appears to perform a significant computation by checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could potentially consume more gas than available during the execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
