contract Crowdsale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
        token = IERC20(_token);
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        uint totalPrice = tokenPrice * _amount;
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= totalPrice, "Insufficient balance");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalPrice);

    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities: 
1) integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer underflow if the calculation of totalPrice results in a value larger than the available balance of the buyer's account.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable should be marked as private to prevent unauthorized access and modification.
3) inconsistent state update: The transfer function should ideally be the last operation to prevent potential reentrancy attacks.
