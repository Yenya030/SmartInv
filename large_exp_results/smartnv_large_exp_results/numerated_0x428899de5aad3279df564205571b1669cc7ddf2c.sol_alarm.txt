Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
7) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs within the contract, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
10) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function may encounter arithmetic flaws if the balance of USDC or WETH becomes zero, leading to unexpected results or errors. 
11) Suicidal contracts: There are no restrictions or safeguards in place to prevent the contract from being destroyed (self-destructed) by unauthorized parties, which could result in loss of funds or functionality.
