The contract to be analyzed:

contract SimpleContract {
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    function mint(uint amount) public {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
    
    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[recipient] += amount;
    }
}

Output: healthy
