The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute()` function is being updated based on the balance of the `votingToken`, which may not provide accurate results due to the order of operations. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which might not provide the intended level of visibility and ownership control. 

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute()` function may require a significant amount of gas to complete the `transferFrom` operation, which could potentially lead to insufficient gas issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
