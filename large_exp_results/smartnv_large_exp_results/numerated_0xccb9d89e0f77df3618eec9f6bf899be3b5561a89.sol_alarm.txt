contract VotingSystem {
     mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
     mapping(address => uint) public voteCount;
     uint public totalVotes;
     
     function vote() public {
         require(hasVoted[msg.sender] == false, "You have already voted");
         hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
         voteCount[msg.sender]++;
         totalVotes++;

}
The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to prevent multiple votes from the same address, leading to a potential ID uniqueness violation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state changes are not done atomically, which could result in inconsistent state updates if an error occurs during the execution of a function.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The mappings for hasVoted and voteCount are public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
