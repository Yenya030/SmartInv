Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Privilege escalation - the contract does not have access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.
2) Inconsistent state update - there could be issues with the state of the proposal struct being modified in different functions without proper synchronization.
3) Integer overflow/underflow - there are arithmetic operations that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if the values are not properly checked.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership - the visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not explicitly defined, which could lead to unintended access or changes by external parties.
