The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is being assigned the balance of the contract after certain conditions are met. This can lead to inconsistent state if multiple calls are made, as the value of `lockedFunds` will keep changing.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions are missing the visibility specifier (public, private, external, internal). By default, functions are public, but it is good practice to explicitly define the visibility of functions for clarity and security. Additionally, the contract does not specify permission levels (such as onlyOwner modifiers) for certain functions, which can lead to unauthorized access to critical functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
