The contract in question is:
contract Escrow {
         address public seller;
         address public buyer;
         address public arbiter;
         uint public amount;
         bool public sellerApproved;
         bool public buyerApproved;
         bool public arbiterApproved;
         enum State { AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE, REFUNDED }
         State public currentState;

         function deposit() public payable {
             require(currentState == State.AWAITING_PAYMENT, "Payment already made");
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit");
             amount = msg.value;
             currentState = State.AWAITING_DELIVERY;
         }

         function confirmPayment() public {
             require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Payment not yet made");
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can confirm payment");
             seller.send(amount);
             sellerApproved = true;
         }
         
         function confirmDelivery() public {
             require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Not in delivery state");
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can receive delivery");
             buyer.send(amount);
             buyerApproved = true;
         }
         
         function requestRefund() public {
             require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Payment not yet made");
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can request refund");
             currentState = State.REFUNDED;
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: There is no specific visibility set for the state variables like seller, buyer, arbiter, amount, sellerApproved, buyerApproved, arbiterApproved, and currentState, making them publicly accessible.
2) Inconsistent state update: The currentState is being inconsistently updated in the deposit and requestRefund functions without thorough checks for the current state, leading to potential state manipulation.
3) Ether leakage: There is a risk of ether being lost if the send function fails due to limitations in gas.
4) Insufficient gas: The use of send to transfer ether may cause issues if the gas stipend provided is lower than required, leading to a failed transaction.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There are no explicit checks to ensure unique identities for the seller, buyer, and arbiter, which could lead to ambiguity or misidentification.
6) Business logic flaw: The contract lacks a comprehensive arbitration system or mechanism to resolve disputes between the parties involved, potentially leaving room for exploitation or unfair outcomes.
