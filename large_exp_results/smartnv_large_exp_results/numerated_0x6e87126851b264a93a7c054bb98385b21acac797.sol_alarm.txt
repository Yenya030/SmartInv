The contract to analyze:

contract TokenExchange {
         IERC20 public token1;
         IERC20 public token2;

         function exchange(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
             token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
             token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) atomicity violation
2) insufficient gas
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
