The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for updating the state in the `startExecute()` and `execute()` functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly define the visibility and ownership of variables and functions, which can result in unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may fail due to running out of gas if the gas limit is set too low, potentially leading to incomplete execution.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
