The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to have any mechanisms in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or override issues.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as `internal`, indicating that it may not have the desired visibility or ownership control.

3) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly incremented within the `execute` function without proper checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

Please ensure to address these vulnerabilities to enhance the security of the contract.
