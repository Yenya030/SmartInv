Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in functions without ensuring that they are updated consistently, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.
2) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functionalities to specific roles, allowing potential privilege escalation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables and functions is not specified, which can lead to unexpected behaviors and potential security issues.
4) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, leading to incomplete or failed transactions.
