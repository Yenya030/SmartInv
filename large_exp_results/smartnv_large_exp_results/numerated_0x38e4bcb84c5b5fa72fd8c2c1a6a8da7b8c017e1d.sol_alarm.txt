The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function mint(uint256 amount) public {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        totalSupply -= amount;
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer Overflow/Underflow: The totalSupply and balances are manipulated directly without any overflow or underflow protection mechanisms, making the contract vulnerable to integer overflow/underflow attacks.
