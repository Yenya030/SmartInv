Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without any synchronization mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions attempt to modify the same `proposal` simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which exposes it to potential unauthorized access from external contracts that can extend the current contract. It should be declared as `private` to restrict access only to the current contract.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function calculates `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` which can consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during contract execution, especially if the token balance is large.
4) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function transfers tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract address and increments `proposal.votedAmount` without using any atomicity mechanisms, leaving the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks and potential inconsistencies in the state.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no explicit check for potential integer overflow/underflow issues in the contract, which can result in unexpected behavior if the values exceed the maximum or minimum range of uint256 type.
