The contract in question potentially contains the following vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without ensuring that the previous proposal has been completed or canceled, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not specify the visibility for the interface functions. This can lead to issues with ownership and access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
