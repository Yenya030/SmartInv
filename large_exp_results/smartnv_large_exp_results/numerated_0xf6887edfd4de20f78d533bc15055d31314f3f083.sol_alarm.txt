potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the lockedFunds variable without any further processing or checks.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is missing visibility specifiers for the state variables owner and votingToken, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
3) integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple calculations involving uint variables without proper overflow/underflow checks, which may result in unexpected behavior.
