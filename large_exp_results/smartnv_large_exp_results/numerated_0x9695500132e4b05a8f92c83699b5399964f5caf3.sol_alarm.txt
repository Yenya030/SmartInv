Contract to analyze:
contract Marketplace {
     address public owner; 
     mapping(address => uint) public balance;
     
     constructor() public {
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function deposit(uint amount) public {
         balance[msg.sender] += amount;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
     }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
