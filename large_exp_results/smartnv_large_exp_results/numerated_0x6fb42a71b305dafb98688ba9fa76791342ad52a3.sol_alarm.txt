Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state, but it doesn't check if the proposal is already ongoing, potentially allowing a user to create multiple proposals at the same time.
2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function transfers tokens and updates the proposal state in multiple steps, which could lead to issues if one step fails and leaves the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but doesn't provide implementations for the required functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with other contracts that rely on the interface.
