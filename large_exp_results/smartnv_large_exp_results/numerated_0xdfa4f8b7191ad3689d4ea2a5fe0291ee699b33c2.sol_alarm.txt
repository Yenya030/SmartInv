Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if a proposal is already in progress, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
- Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function checks if the execution has ended by comparing block timestamps, which can be manipulated by miners, leading to potential execution failures due to insufficient gas.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not explicitly set to private, making it publicly accessible and potentially leading to ownership vulnerabilities.
