Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly in the `execute` function without properly handling race conditions or concurrency issues, which may lead to inconsistent states.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, which could potentially lead to accessibility or ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes and transfers, which may require a significant amount of gas to execute. If the gas limit is not sufficient, the function execution may fail.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping uses `proposal.addr` as the key, which may not ensure unique IDs within the mapping entries, potentially leading to data inconsistencies.

5) Business logic flaw: The logic for checking if the execution has ended in the `execute` function may be flawed, as it only verifies the timestamp instead of considering other factors that determine the end of execution.

6) Atomicity violation: The state changes in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single atomic operation, which may lead to partial execution and inconsistent states if an exception occurs during the function execution.

7) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute critical functions like `endExecute`.

8) Ether leakage: The contract does not have mechanisms to handle Ether transactions securely, potentially leading to Ether leakage or loss.

9) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `calculatePrice` function may result in arithmetic flaws if the division operation leads to integer underflow or unexpected results.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
4) ID uniqueness violation
5) Business logic flaw
6) Atomicity violation
7) Privilege escalation
8) Ether leakage
9) Arithmetic flaw
