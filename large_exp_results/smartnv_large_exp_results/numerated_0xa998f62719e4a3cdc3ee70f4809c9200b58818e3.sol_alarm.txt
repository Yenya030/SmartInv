The contract presented for analysis:
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities found in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The code does not update the state variables consistently or securely after the operations, leaving room for unexpected behavior.
2) Insufficient gas: There might be a risk of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions due to inadequate gas allocation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not explicitly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
