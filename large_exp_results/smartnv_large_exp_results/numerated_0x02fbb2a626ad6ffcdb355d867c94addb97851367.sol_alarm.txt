Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract at a specific point in time. However, the contract's balance could change after this check is performed, leading to an inconsistent state update.
2) Reentrancy: The `execute()` function transfers tokens and updates the `votedAmount` without using the reentrancy guard, potentially enabling reentrancy attacks.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility and ownership of its functions, making it prone to access control vulnerabilities.
