The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function without proper synchronization or handling of updates from multiple transactions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is only internally accessible, limiting the visibility and potentially causing access control issues.
