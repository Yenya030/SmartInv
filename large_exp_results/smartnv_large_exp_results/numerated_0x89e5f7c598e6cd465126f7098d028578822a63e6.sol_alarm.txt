In the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct and 'votingToken' variables are defined as internal, which may not be the intended visibility. It could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount += amount;' line in the 'execute' function updates the 'votedAmount' without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The 'startingBalanceList' mapping may not ensure unique ID assignment, leading to potential conflicts or unexpected behavior.
