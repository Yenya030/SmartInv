The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the state of the "proposal" struct without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The "votedProposal" function seems to update a proposal without checking for ID uniqueness, potentially causing issues with duplicate or conflicting proposals.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may fail to execute successfully if there is insufficient gas provided, leading to potential contract failures.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "owner" variable is not specified, which can lead to potential ownership control issues if not properly controlled and managed within the contract.
