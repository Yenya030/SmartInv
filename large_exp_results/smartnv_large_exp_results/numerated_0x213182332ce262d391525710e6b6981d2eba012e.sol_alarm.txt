The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable in the `TimelockController` contract is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to visibility issues or ownership concerns.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function in the `TimelockController` contract performs a gas-intensive operation (`lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));`), which could potentially run out of gas and cause the function to fail.

4) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function in the `TimelockController` contract checks if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` to determine if the execution was successful, which may not be a valid business logic rule and could lead to unexpected outcomes.
