The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership for the owner variable.
2) Lack of proper access control for functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute.
3) Inconsistent state update in execute function by directly increasing votedAmount without proper synchronization.
4) Lack of input validation in functions like execute and endExecute.
5) Possible reentrancy vulnerability in the execute function.
6) Insufficient gas allocation in functions that interact with external contracts.
7) Potential integer overflow in operations involving uint256 variables.
