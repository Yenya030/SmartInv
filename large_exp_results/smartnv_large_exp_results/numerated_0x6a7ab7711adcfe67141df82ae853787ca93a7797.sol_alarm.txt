The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update:
   - In function `startExecute()`, `proposal` is being updated without initializing it.
   - In function `execute()`, `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly, which could lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide implementation for its functions, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The `endExecute()` function may fail due to running out of gas when checking `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, especially with a large number of token holders.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
