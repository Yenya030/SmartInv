The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

8) Reentrancy: The contract's `liquidate` function allows for external calls to `USDC.transferFrom` and `WETH.transferFrom`, which could potentially result in a reentrancy vulnerability if the called contracts also make external calls back to the `ExchangeTokens` contract before completing their operations.

10) Arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate` function, the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` may result in arithmetic flaws if the values involved are not carefully validated before the calculation is performed.

11) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have any provisions for preventing or handling potentially malicious `selfdestruct` calls, which could lead to the contract being destroyed and its assets being irrecoverably lost.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Reentrancy, Arithmetic flaw, and Suicidal contracts.
