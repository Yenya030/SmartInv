The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the 'proposal' struct to track proposals, but the state updates for the proposal are done in different functions like 'startExecute', 'execute', and 'endExecute'. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is used without specifying any visibility (public, private, internal), which can lead to potential issues in terms of visibility and ownership control. 

3) Insufficient gas: The function 'endExecute' performs a check on the balance of the contract address, but if the contract runs out of gas during this check, it could result in an incomplete or incorrect execution.

Therefore, the contract contains vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
