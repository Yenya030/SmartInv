The vulnerable aspects of the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` in contract `TimelockController` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the `balanceOf` the contract, which may not accurately represent the funds that are actually locked.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculation within the `liquidate` function of contract `ExchangeTokens` when calculating `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear from the provided code snippets whether the visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions are appropriately defined in both contracts. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the analyzed contract are: inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
