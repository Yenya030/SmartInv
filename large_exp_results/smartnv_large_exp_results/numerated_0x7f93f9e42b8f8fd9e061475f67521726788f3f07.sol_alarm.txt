The potential vulnerabilities in the "Marketplace" contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer underflow in the purchase function if the user's balance becomes negative. 

2) Inconsistent state update: The balances are updated directly without proper validation or synchronization, leaving room for inconsistencies or errors in the data.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, which exposes sensitive data to everyone on the blockchain.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the "Marketplace" contract are Integer overflow/underflow, Inconsistent state update, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
