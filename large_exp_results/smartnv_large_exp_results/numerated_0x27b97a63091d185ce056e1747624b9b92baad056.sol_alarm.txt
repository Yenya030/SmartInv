The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates due to the lack of managing states properly in functions like `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute`.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not explicitly defined as public or private, which can lead to unexpected visibility issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail in case the gas provided is insufficient for the required operations.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

5) Atomicity violation: The operations within functions like `execute` are not atomic, which may result in unexpected outcomes if interrupted.

6) Reentrancy: The contract may be susceptible to reentrancy attacks if proper precautions are not taken in functions like `execute`.

7) Ether leakage: There is potential for ether leakage if the contract does not handle ether transactions properly.

8) Business logic flaw: The contract may have business logic flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, atomicity violation, reentrancy, ether leakage, and business logic flaw.
