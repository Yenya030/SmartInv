The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The `execute` function in the contract has a potential issue related to the voting process of the proposal, where the condition `proposal.votedAmount == 0` might not be sufficient to ensure that the voting process has been completed correctly.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function also has a potential vulnerability related to atomicity violation, where the transfer of tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract address might not be executed atomically with the update of `proposal.votedAmount`.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have a mechanism in place to ensure unique identification for proposals or addresses, which could lead to potential conflicts or errors in the system.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions within the contract could potentially expose sensitive data or functionalities to unauthorized parties, leading to security risks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Business logic flaw
- Atomicity violation
- ID uniqueness violation
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
