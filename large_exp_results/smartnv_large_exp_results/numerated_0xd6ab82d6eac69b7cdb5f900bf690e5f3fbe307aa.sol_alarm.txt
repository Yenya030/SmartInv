The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state of the proposal without considering any checks for consistency, such as ensuring that only the owner or a specific role can start the execution.

2) Insufficient gas: The `transferFrom()` function in the `execute()` function might fail if the contract runs out of gas during the transfer.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear who has the ownership of the `votingToken` contract and whether external entities can manipulate it, leading to potential ownership vulnerabilities.
