Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state of the `proposal` struct in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization or atomicity checks.
   
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not check for the uniqueness of `proposal.addr` when updating the `startingBalanceList`.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which may not be intended and could lead to potential ownership vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
