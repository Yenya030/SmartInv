Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly in the "execute" function without properly handling potential reentrancy issues.
2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may fail if the gas limit is exceeded due to the potential high gas cost of the operation inside the "require" statement.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct and other variables are declared as internal or public without considering the implications of visibility and ownership control. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
