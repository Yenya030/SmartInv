Given the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates due to the modification of proposal state variables in functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute without proper synchronization or validation.

2) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract may require more gas than available, leading to failed transactions or unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions within the contract may not be properly defined, leading to potential security risks.
