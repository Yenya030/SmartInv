The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract lacks explicit visibility and ownership control mechanisms, allowing potentially unauthorized access to critical functions and data.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple functions that update the state of the contract without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract's data.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does not ensure atomicity in the transfer of tokens, which could result in unexpected behavior or loss of funds.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require excessive gas to execute if the balance of `address(this)` is significantly high, potentially causing the function to fail due to gas limitations.
