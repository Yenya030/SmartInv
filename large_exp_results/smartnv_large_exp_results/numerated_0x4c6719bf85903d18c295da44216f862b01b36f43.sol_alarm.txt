The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the owner to start a proposal and execute functions without proper checks on authorization.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` without considering multiple transactions occurring simultaneously.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `execute` function transfers tokens to the contract, potentially causing inconsistencies in token balances across different components.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `execution` function does not enforce proper access control to ensure that only authorized users can execute proposals.
