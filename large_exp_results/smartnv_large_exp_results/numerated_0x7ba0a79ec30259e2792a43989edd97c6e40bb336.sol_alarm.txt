Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract may be susceptible to privilege escalation as there is no access control mechanism in place, allowing anyone to call functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute without proper authorization.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update as the startingBalanceList is updated in the startExecute function but not used or updated in subsequent functions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

3) Atomicity violation: The execution of operations in functions like execute may not be atomic, making the contract vulnerable to race conditions and inconsistent state transitions.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like owner and the lack of explicit ownership mechanism may lead to ownership-related vulnerabilities in the contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
