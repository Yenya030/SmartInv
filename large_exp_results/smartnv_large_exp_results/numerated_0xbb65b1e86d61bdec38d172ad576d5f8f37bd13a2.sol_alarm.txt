The contract provided:

contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public admin;
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    bool public isSaleActive;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, address _beneficiary, uint _tokenPrice) {
        token = _token;
        admin = msg.sender;
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
        isSaleActive = true;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(isSaleActive == true, "Sale is not active");
        uint totalPrice = _amount * tokenPrice;
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= totalPrice, "Insufficient balance");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, beneficiary, _amount);
    }

    function endSale() public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can end the sale");
        isSaleActive = false;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to view and potentially modify it. It should be made private or internal to prevent unauthorized access.
- Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function does not consider the gas cost for the transaction, which may lead to failed transactions if the gas limit is exceeded.
- Inconsistent state update: The isSaleActive state is changed in the endSale function by only the admin, but there is no check to prevent this state change if the sale has already ended or if it is ended multiple times.
- Reentrancy: The buyTokens function performs token transfer before updating the balance, which could result in reentrancy attacks if the recipient contract initiates additional contract calls.

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership 
- insufficient gas 
- inconsistent state update 
- reentrancy
