Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly updated inside the `execute` function without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level. This could potentially lead to ownership control issues.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions, especially in the `endExecute` function where multiple require statements are used together, potentially leading to insufficient gas for completing the transaction.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not provide any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or identifiers, such as `proposal.addr` or `proposal.sTime`, which could lead to conflicts or duplication issues.

5) Business logic flaw: There seem to be inconsistencies in the business logic, such as the conditions for executing proposals or ending execution, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
