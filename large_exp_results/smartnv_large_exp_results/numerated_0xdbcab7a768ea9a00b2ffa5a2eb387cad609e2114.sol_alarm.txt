The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the state of `proposal.votedAmount` without using proper synchronization techniques, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does multiple state changes (transfer and update) which may not be atomic, leading to potential issues if one operation fails and the others succeed.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not properly checked.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions explicitly, which could result in Ether being sent to the contract accidentally or maliciously.

5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `lockedFunds` variables are declared without any explicit visibility specifier, which could lead to incorrect access control or visibility issues.

6) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to restrict sensitive functions like `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` to only authorized users.

7) Insufficient gas: The contract does complex operations like transferring tokens and calculating balances, which could result in insufficient gas for transactions to be executed successfully.
