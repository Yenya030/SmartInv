The contract provided for analysis:

contract Escrow {
        address public payer;
        address public recipient;
        uint public amount;

        constructor(address _payer, address _recipient, uint _amount) {
            payer = _payer;
            recipient = _recipient;
            amount = _amount;
        }

        function deposit() public payable {
            require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can deposit");
            require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect deposit amount");
        }

        function release() public {
            require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can release funds");
            recipient.transfer(amount);
        }
    }
