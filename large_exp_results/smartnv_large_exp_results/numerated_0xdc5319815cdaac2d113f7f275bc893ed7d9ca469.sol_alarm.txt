The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not have any implementation for its functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without considering potential reentrancy issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function might run out of gas if the `votedProposal` function consumes too much gas.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation involving `votingToken.balanceOf` and `votingToken.totalSupply` in the `endExecute` function.
