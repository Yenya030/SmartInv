Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the variables `votingToken`, `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, and `startingBalanceList`, leaving them potentially accessible externally. 
- Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` is incremented without proper synchronization between multiple transactions, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas cost of the operations in the functions, there might be a risk of running out of gas during the execution, especially in the `endExecute` function where a significant calculation is involved.
