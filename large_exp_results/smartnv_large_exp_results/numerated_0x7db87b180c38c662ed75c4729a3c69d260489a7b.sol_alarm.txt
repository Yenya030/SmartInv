Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" statement in the execute function updates the state variable without accounting for potential concurrency issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of certain functions and variables are not properly specified, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. 

Overall assessment: The contract contains vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates and incorrect visibility/ownership.
