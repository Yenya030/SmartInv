The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract. This can lead to an inconsistent state if the balance changes unexpectedly.

2) atomicity violation: The execute() function performs multiple actions (transfer and update proposal.votedAmount) without being wrapped in a single atomic operation, which can lead to inconsistent state if one action fails while the other succeeds.

3) integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve amounts (such as votedAmount and balances) which can potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and integer overflow/underflow.
