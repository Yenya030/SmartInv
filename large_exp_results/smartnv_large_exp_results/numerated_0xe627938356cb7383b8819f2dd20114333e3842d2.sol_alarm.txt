The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract performs state updates in the execute function without ensuring atomicity, potentially leading to inconsistent state changes in case of reentrancy or unexpected behavior.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract uses arithmetic operations without explicitly checking for potential overflow or underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of certain functions and variables, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of critical contract functionalities.
