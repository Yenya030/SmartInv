Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is being updated in the "endExecute" function without any checks or validations, potentially leading to unexpected or inconsistent state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility: The "propoasl" struct is being accessed directly by external functions, which could expose sensitive information and introduce security risks. Consider limiting the visibility of the struct or implementing access control mechanisms.
