The following potential vulnerabilities are identified in the provided contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can make them vulnerable to outside manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state variables like 'lockedFunds', 'startingBalanceList', and 'proposal.votedAmount' are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistent state issues.
3) Insufficient gas: Functions like 'endExecute' may require more gas than available in certain scenarios due to the gas calculation, potentially causing the function to fail.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The 'startExecute' function does not implement a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposals, which can lead to unexpected behavior if multiple proposals are created simultaneously.
