The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the necessary functions or state variables required by the interface, which could lead to inconsistent behavior or errors in external interactions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could result in inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially expensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) that could consume too much gas and lead to transaction failure or denial of service.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `lockedFunds` variable is not defined or used within the contract, which could result in unintended consequences or violations of ID uniqueness. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- ID uniqueness violation
