Potential vulnerabilities in the Contract Analyzer:
- Inconsistent state update: The totalSupply is updated inconsistently in the deposit and withdraw functions, which could lead to incorrect total supply calculations.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas issues, which could result in the contract being unable to execute certain functions completely.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public, which exposes ownership details publicly and may lead to security risks.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There are potential risks of integer overflow/underflow in the totalSupply calculations and balance adjustments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
