Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal which might expose it to potential privilege escalation attacks.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state of the proposal struct without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function might require a significant amount of gas to process if the execution condition is not met, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could lead to integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.
