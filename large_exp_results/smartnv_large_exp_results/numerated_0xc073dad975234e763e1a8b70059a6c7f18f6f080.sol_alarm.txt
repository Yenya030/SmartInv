The potential vulnerabilities in the contract below are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented directly without using a locking mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility for ownership control. It should be explicitly defined as `public`, `private`, or `external` based on the desired access control.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the execution of the `endExecute` function if the gas limit is not set appropriately for the operation being performed.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
