The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract is vulnerable to a business logic flaw as the condition for liquidation may not be accurately calculating the appropriate situation for liquidation. 

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract may be vulnerable to an arithmetic flaw if the division operation results in a situation where the denominator is zero, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are a business logic flaw and an arithmetic flaw.
