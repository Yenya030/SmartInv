The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without using any mechanism to ensure atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total supply of the token, but this operation may consume a large amount of gas and could result in running out of gas during the execution.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure its security.
