In the provided contract:

1) There is a potential vulnerability for reentrancy in the `execute` function, where an external contract could call the `votingToken.transferFrom` function and potentially execute malicious code before the rest of the `execute` function completes.

2) The `endExecute` function includes a potential vulnerability for integer overflow/underflow in the line `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, where an unchecked multiplication operation could lead to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are reentrancy and integer overflow/underflow.
