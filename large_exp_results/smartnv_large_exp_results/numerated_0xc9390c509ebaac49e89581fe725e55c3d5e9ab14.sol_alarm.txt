The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Lack of proper access control in the confirm(), dispute(), and resolve() functions may lead to unauthorized actions being taken by parties who should not have the authority.
2) Inconsistent state update: State transitions may not be correctly enforced, allowing for unexpected or incorrect state changes during the contract's lifecycle.
