Potential Vulnerabilities:
10) Arithmetic flaw: In the buyTokens function, there is a potential arithmetic flaw when checking if there are enough tokens available. If an overflow or underflow occurs, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The withdrawTokens function allows anyone to call it, but it should only be accessible to the admin. This incorrect visibility/ownership can lead to unauthorized token withdrawals.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The transferAdmin function also allows anyone to call it, but it should only be accessible to the current admin. This incorrect visibility/ownership can lead to unauthorized transfer of admin rights.
