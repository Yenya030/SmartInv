The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates due to the lack of proper synchronization mechanisms in the execution of functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions are not explicitly defined in the contract, which may lead to unintended access and manipulation by unauthorized entities.
