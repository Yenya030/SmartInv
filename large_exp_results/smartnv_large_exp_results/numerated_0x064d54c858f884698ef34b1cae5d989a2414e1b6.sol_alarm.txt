The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The functions in the contract (startExecute, execute, endExecute) update the state variables without proper checks or validations, which can lead to inconsistent data state.

2) Atomicity violation: The operations in the functions (startExecute, execute, endExecute) are not atomic, meaning they are not executed as a single, indivisible unit, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of functions, which can lead to potential issues with accessibility and ownership control.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
