Output:
-ID uniqueness violation: The `hasVoted` mapping uses the `msg.sender` address as the key, which may not guarantee uniqueness in certain scenarios. This could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple users have the same address.
-Arithmetic flaw: The `totalVotes` count is directly manipulated with addition and subtraction operations, which could lead to integer overflows or underflows if the count becomes very large or negative.
-Healthy
