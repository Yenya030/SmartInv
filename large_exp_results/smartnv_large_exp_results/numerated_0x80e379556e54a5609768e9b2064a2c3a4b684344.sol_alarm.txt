The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update:
- The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without properly checking if the proposal is still active. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if the execute function is called multiple times for the same proposal.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The internal state variable owner is not used or updated anywhere in the contract, which could potentially lead to ownership control vulnerabilities if ownership was intended to be managed but not implemented correctly.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The function endExecute() performs a gas-intensive operation where it checks if the locked funds exceed a certain threshold. If the gas limit is reached during this operation, it could result in a failed execution, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

4) Atomicity violation:
- The function endExecute() lacks proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the operations within the function are executed atomically. This could lead to race conditions and inconsistent data states.

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and atomicity violation.
