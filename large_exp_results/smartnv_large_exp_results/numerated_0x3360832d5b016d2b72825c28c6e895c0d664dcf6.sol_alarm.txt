Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: the function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal but does not update the state of the proposal itself, which can lead to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the `votingToken` variable is declared as public, which might expose sensitive information publicly. 

3) Insufficient gas: the function `endExecute` might run out of gas if there are too many voters, as it calculates the locked funds based on the balance of the contract.

4) ID uniqueness violation: there is no check for duplicate proposals, which could result in multiple proposals with the same ID.

5) Atomicity violation: the `execute` function does not perform all actions atomically, which could lead to inconsistent or unexpected outcomes if an error occurs during execution. 

6) Suicidal contracts: there is no protection against the contract being destroyed or self-destructed, which could result in loss of funds or disruption of the contract's operation. 

7) Ether leakage: there is no mechanism to handle unexpected ether transfers to the contract, which could lead to loss of funds. 

8) Reentrancy: the contract does not prevent reentrancy attacks in interactions with external contracts, potentially allowing malicious contracts to manipulate the contract's state.

9) Integer overflow/underflow: there are potential vulnerabilities to integer overflow/underflow in calculations involving balances and amounts, which could result in unintended behavior.
