Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for the update of the `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` mapping in the `startExecute` function, but does not handle potential re-entrancy issues by external calls.

2) Missing visibility/ownership: The visibility or ownership of the `votingToken` variable is not specified, which could lead to potential security risks if not properly restricted.

3) Insufficient gas: The gas usage in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions is not clearly defined, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the `calculatePrice` function when performing calculations on `cAmount` and `dAmount`.

5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, which could lead to potential security risks if not properly restricted.
