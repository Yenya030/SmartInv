The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract might face issues with inconsistent state updates as there are multiple state variables being modified in different functions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of some functions and state variables, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run into issues due to insufficient gas provided for certain operations, leading to failed or incomplete transactions.
