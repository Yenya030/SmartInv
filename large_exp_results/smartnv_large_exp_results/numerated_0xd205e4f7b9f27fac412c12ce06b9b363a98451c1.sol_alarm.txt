The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
- Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` state variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential integer overflow in the `calculatePrice` function if the balance of `USDC` or `WETH` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `uint` variable.
