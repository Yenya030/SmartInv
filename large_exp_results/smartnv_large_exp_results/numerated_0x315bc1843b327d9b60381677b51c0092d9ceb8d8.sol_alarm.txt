The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the function `endExecute()` without any proper synchronization mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The interface `IERC20` is used in the contract without specifying its visibility (public, internal, private). This can potentially lead to visibility issues and ownership concerns.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
