This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The update of the `proposal` struct in the `startExecute` function may not properly handle the state of ongoing proposals. There is a possibility of inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation:
   - It seems that there is no check for the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The visibility of the `proposal` struct is not specified, which might lead to unintended visibility or accessibility of the struct's data.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) ID uniqueness violation
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
