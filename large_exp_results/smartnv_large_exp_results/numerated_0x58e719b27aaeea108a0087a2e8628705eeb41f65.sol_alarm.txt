Potential vulnerabilities:
3) business logic flaw: There is a potential issue with the logic of releasing funds based on the calculated shares in the `addPayee` function. The release of funds may not be distributed correctly if the calculation of shares or totalShares is incorrect.
6) cross bridge inconsistency: There could be a discrepancy in the handling of funds across different functions that deal with releasing payments, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
