Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Insufficient gas: There are no gas stipulations in the contract, which could lead to out-of-gas exceptions during execution.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which could expose it to potential unauthorized access or changes.
