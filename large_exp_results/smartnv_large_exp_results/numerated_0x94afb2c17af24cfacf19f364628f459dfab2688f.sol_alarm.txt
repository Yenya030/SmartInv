The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update - The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly finalizing the proposal process, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas - The function `endExecute` may require a significant amount of gas to execute, especially if there are a large number of token holders, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
