Contract:
```solidity
contract Marketplace {
    IERC20 public token;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function buy(uint amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        uint price = amount * 2;
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), price);
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function sell(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        uint price = amount * 2;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, price);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Price manipulation: The price calculation in the buy and sell functions is based on a fixed multiplier of 2, which could potentially be manipulated to exploit price discrepancies.
2) Inconsistent state update: The balances mapping is updated in the buy and sell functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions modify the same balance concurrently.
