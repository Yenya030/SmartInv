The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, leaving them potentially publicly accessible.
2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a large amount of gas to execute if `votingToken.transferFrom` and `votedProposal` operations consume a significant amount of gas.
3) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` is updated before the success of `votingToken.transferFrom`, leading to inconsistent state if the transfer fails.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not handle the uniqueness of proposals identified by `msg.sender`, potentially allowing multiple proposals from the same address.
5) Atomicity violation: The `startExecute` function sets multiple values (`proposal` and `startingBalanceList`) without making them atomic, allowing external interference in between setting them.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- Inconsistent state update
- ID uniqueness violation
- Atomicity violation
