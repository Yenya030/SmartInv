The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks access control mechanisms, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of data or execution of functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution, especially in functions like liquidate() where external calls are made, potentially causing the function to revert midway.
