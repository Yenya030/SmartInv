Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `debt` and `collateral` might be updated in an inconsistent manner, leading to unexpected behavior in the `liquidate` function.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function might result in incorrect amounts due to potential arithmetic flaws.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `calculatePrice` function is set to public, which may expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
4) Reentrancy: The `liquidate` function transfers tokens without employing proper checks to prevent reentrancy attacks.
