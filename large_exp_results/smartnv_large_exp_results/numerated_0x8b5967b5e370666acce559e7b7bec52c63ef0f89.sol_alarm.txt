The contract below may have the following vulnerabilities:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Business logic flaw

```solidity
contract Marketplace {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public items;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function addItem(uint itemId, uint price) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can add items");
        items[itemId] = price;
    }

    function purchaseItem(uint itemId) public {
        uint itemPrice = items[itemId];
        require(itemPrice > 0, "Item not found");
        require(msg.value >= itemPrice, "Insufficient funds");

        payable(owner).transfer(itemPrice);
        items[itemId] = 0; // Set price to 0 to mark item as sold
    }
}
```
