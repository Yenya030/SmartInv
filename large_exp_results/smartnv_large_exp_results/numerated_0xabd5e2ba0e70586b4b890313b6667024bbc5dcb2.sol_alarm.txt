Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute does not reset the proposal state variables after execution, potentially leading to incorrect state in subsequent calls.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of overflow in the expression (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) in the liquidate function.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables debt and collateral are publicly accessible, which may expose sensitive information.
