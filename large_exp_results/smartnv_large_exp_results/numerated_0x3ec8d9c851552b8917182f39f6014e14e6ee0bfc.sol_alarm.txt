Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Business logic flaw: The liquidate function does not correctly check if the user's fund can be liquidated based on the calculations of debt and collateral, which could lead to unintended liquidations.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The debt and collateral mappings are public, which may expose sensitive information about user's debt and collateral positions.
- Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function may be vulnerable to price manipulation if external factors can influence the balances of USDC and WETH in the pair contract.
