The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has functions that update the state of the proposal without proper checks, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the contract state.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a high amount of gas to execute, which could result in out of gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of certain variables and functions are not clearly defined, which can lead to security vulnerabilities or unintended access.
