contract Escrow {
     address public buyer;
     address public seller;
     address public arbiter;
     bool public released;
     uint public amount;
     
     constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
         buyer = _buyer;
         seller = _seller;
         arbiter = _arbiter;
         amount = _amount;
         released = false;
     }

     function releaseAmount() public {
         require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "Not authorized");
         require(released == false, "Amount already released");
         released = true;
         payable(seller).transfer(amount);
     }

     function refundAmount() public {
         require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == arbiter, "Not authorized");
         require(released == false, "Amount already released");
         released = true;
         payable(buyer).transfer(amount);
     }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseAmount function does not require the arbiter to be involved in the release process, potentially allowing the buyer or seller to unilaterally release the funds without the arbiter's authorization.
- Insufficient gas: If the contract balance is low, the transfer of funds in the releaseAmount and refundAmount functions may fail due to running out of gas.
- Inconsistent state update: The released state is set to true before the transfer of funds, which could lead to issues if the transfer fails after setting released to true.
