The code snippet provided for analysis:
<\example_3\>
contract PaymentContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
<\example_3\> 

Potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentContract:
- Reentrancy: The withdraw function allows the caller to withdraw funds and then potentially call another function before completion, allowing for reentrant attacks.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is set as public, which could expose sensitive information. 

Output:
1) reentrancy
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
