The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without proper synchronization or protection, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is a lack of uniqueness enforcement for proposals as there is no mechanism to ensure unique IDs for each proposal, leading to potential conflicts or data corruption.
3) Insufficient gas: The execution of certain functions, especially those involving token transfers, may require a significant amount of gas which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors and contract failures.
