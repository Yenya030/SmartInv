The contract to analyze is:

contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    
    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "User has already voted");
        // logic for voting 
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "You are not authorized to change admin");
        admin = newAdmin;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- privilege escalation
- incorrect visibility/ownership
