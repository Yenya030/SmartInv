The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variables proposal and startingBalanceList without considering synchronization issues that may lead to inconsistent data state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not provide the required functions and variables, potentially leading to ownership and visibility issues.
