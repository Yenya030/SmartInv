Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable in the 'endExecute' function is being updated without any proper check or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The access level of the 'proposal' struct is not specified, which could lead to potential security issues related to visibility and ownership. 

3) Insufficient gas: There is no specific handling of gas limits or gas usage in the contract, which could potentially result in out-of-gas errors or failed transactions.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation of 'votedAmount' in the 'execute' function, as there is no check for overflow conditions.

5) Business logic flaw: The logic related to checking if the 'execution has ended' in the 'execute' and 'endExecute' functions may need further review to ensure it is correctly implemented to prevent potential business logic flaws.
