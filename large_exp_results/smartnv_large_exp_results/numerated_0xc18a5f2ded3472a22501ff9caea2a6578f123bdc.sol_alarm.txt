Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation: The contract does not properly handle permission levels for certain functions, allowing unauthorized users to execute critical functions.
- Atomicity violation: The contract does not ensure that specific operations are executed atomically, potentially leading to inconsistent states or unexpected behavior.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables are not properly defined, leading to potential security risks or unauthorized access.
