Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated without any protection against reentrancy or race conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which may expose it to potential privilege escalation attacks if not properly managed.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` consumes more gas than expected, leading to a failed execution.
