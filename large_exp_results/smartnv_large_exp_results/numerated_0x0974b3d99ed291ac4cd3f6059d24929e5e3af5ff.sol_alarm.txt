The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables WETH, USDC, pair, debt, and collateral are all public, potentially exposing sensitive information to external actors.
- Insufficient gas: The liquidate function might run out of gas if the gas limit is set too low, leading to the transaction being reverted before completion.
