The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The function liquidate in the contract ExchangeTokens does not properly verify if the collateral provided by the user is enough to cover their debt before executing the transfer. This could lead to a situation where the user's debt is not fully covered, resulting in a loss for the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables WETH, USDC, and pair in the contract ExchangeTokens are public, which could expose sensitive information to external parties. It is recommended to make these variables private or internal to prevent unauthorized access.
