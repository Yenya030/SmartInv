<\output\> 
Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) privilege escalation: The admin can be changed by any address rather than just the current admin.
2) inconsistent state update: The hasVoted mapping is not updated when a vote is cast, allowing for potential double voting.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable can be publicly changed by calling the updateAdmin function.
