Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, which could lead to potential issues with ownership control.

2) inconsistent state update: The startingBalanceList mapping in the startExecute function is updated without any proper validation or synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail due to running out of gas as it includes multiple require statements and a potentially expensive operation (checking balanceOf twice).

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.

5) atomicity violation: The execute function includes multiple operations which are not executed atomically, increasing the risk of race conditions and inconsistent state.

6) reentrancy: The execute function allows for external calls (votingToken.transferFrom), which could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if not handled properly.
