The contract provided for analysis: 

contract TokenSwap {
     address public token1;
     address public token2;
     uint public token1Reserve;
     uint public token2Reserve;

     function swap(uint amountIn, address fromToken, address toToken) external {
          require(fromToken == token1 || fromToken == token2, "Invalid from token");
          require(toToken == token1 || toToken == token2, "Invalid to token");

          if (fromToken == token1) {
               require(amountIn <= token1Reserve, "Not enough tokens in reserve");
               // Swap logic
          } else {
               require(amountIn <= token2Reserve, "Not enough tokens in reserve");
               // Swap logic
          }
     }
}

Output:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates where the token reserve values may not be properly updated after a swap operation, potentially leading to incorrect balances.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract may not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive functions, potentially leading to unauthorized swaps.

3) Business logic flaw: The contract may have flaws in its business logic, such as not handling edge cases or potential errors properly, which may lead to unexpected behavior during swaps.
