Based on the contract provided, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the `lockedFunds` variable without specifying its type or showing how it is defined. This may lead to inconsistency in the state if the variable is not properly updated or defined.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votedProposal()` function, which could lead to undesired access by external contracts.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
