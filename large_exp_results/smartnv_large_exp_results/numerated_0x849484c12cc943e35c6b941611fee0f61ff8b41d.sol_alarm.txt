The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable proposal.votedAmount is updated in the execute function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the internal variable 'owner' is not specified, which can lead to potential ownership vulnerabilities.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of ID duplication or non-uniqueness in the way proposals are handled and stored, which may lead to vulnerabilities.
