The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `Proposal` struct is declared as `internal` but should be `public`.
2) inconsistent state update: There is a potential issue with updating the state of the proposal in the `execute` function. The code may need to update the state atomically to avoid inconsistencies.
3) insufficient gas: There might be a risk of running out of gas during the execution of the `endExecute` function because it calculates the locked funds based on the balance of the contract, which could be high and lead to running out of gas.
4) atomicity violation: The updates to `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function are not done atomically, which could lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior.
5) potentially suicidal contracts: The contract might be at risk of becoming a suicidal contract due to the lack of adequate safeguards or self-destruct mechanisms.
