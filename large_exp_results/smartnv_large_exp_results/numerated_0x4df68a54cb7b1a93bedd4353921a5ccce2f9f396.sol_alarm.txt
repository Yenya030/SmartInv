Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables "owner" and "votingToken", making them publicly accessible which can lead to unwanted manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The variable "proposal" is not properly initialized before being used in functions like "startExecute()" and "endExecute()", which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The function "endExecute()" may require a high amount of gas to execute successfully due to the potentially large calculation in the require statement, leading to insufficient gas error.
4) Incorrect visibility: The function "votedProposal()" is called without being defined in the contract, indicating a potential visibility issue or an undeclared function.
