The contract provided for analysis:

contract Crowdsale {
     address public owner;
     uint public tokenPrice;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     constructor(uint _tokenPrice) {
          owner = msg.sender;
          tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
          require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Insufficient funds");
          balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
          uint amount = address(this).balance;
          msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

Output: 
1) price manipulation
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
