The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated without any proper synchronization or atomicity check, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is declared with internal visibility, which may not be intended and could lead to unexpected behavior.

3) Potential reentrancy: The `execute` function transfers tokens before updating the state variables, leaving the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract and total supply of the token to confirm execution, which could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

5) Business logic flaw: The `startExecute` function allows starting a new proposal without checking for existing ongoing proposals, which could lead to unexpected behavior and conflicts.

6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could cause issues related to duplicate data or conflicts.

7) Privilege escalation: The use of `proposal.addr` without proper access control checks could potentially lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
