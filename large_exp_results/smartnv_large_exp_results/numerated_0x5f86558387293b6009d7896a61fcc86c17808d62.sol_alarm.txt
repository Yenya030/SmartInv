The contract provided for analysis:

contract WithdrawContract {
    uint public balance;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance = 0;
    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        balance += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(amount <= balance, "Not enough balance");
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the WithdrawContract:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not have checks for potential integer overflow or underflow in the balance variable manipulation.

2) Insufficient gas: The use of transfer in the withdraw function may result in out-of-gas errors if the contract's gas stipend is not enough to cover the transfer operation.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which could allow unauthorized parties to change the owner of the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the WithdrawContract are integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
