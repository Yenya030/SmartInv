The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without any condition checks, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables WETH, USDC, pair, debt, and collateral is set to public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential risk of integer overflow in the liquidate function when calculating the amount to transfer, as well as in the calculatePrice function when performing division operations.
