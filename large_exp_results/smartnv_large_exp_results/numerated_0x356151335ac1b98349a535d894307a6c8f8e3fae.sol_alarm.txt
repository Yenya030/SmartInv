Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute()" function updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state if other functions interact with the lockedFunds variable without updating it appropriately.

2) Insufficient gas: The "startExecute()" function contains a call to the external function getStartingBalance(proposal.addr) which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to Out of Gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is not explicitly defined, which could lead to issues regarding who can access and modify this variable.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
