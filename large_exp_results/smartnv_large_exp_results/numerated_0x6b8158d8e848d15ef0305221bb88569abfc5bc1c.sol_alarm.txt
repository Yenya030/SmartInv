Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The access level of variables like `owner` and `votingToken` is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
