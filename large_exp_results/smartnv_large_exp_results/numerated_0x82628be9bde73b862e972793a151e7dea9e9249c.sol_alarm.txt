Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the functions and variables in the contract is not specified. It is important to define whether functions should be public, external, internal, or private to maintain proper access control.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the `proposal` struct is updated without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential vulnerabilities.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not implement any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially require a large amount of gas if the total supply of `votingToken` is significantly high, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.

5) Atomicity violation: Multiple state changes occur in the `execute` function without proper atomicity checks, which can lead to vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, which could lead to Ether leakage if funds are sent to the contract inadvertently.

7) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply of `votingToken` to determine the success of execution, which might not accurately reflect the business logic.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to state management, visibility, gas optimization, and transaction handling.
