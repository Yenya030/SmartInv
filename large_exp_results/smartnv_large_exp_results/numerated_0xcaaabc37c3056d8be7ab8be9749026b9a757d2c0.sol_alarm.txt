Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation - There seems to be a potential vulnerability related to ID uniqueness violation in the contract as there are mappings using addresses which may not guarantee uniqueness.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of functions and variables, which can lead to unintended access and manipulation of data.
3) Insufficient gas - There is a risk of running out of gas during execution due to multiple state changes and external function calls without considering gas limits.
4) Atomicity violation - The contract is performing multiple state changes in different functions without ensuring atomicity, which can lead to inconsistent or incomplete updates in case of failures.
