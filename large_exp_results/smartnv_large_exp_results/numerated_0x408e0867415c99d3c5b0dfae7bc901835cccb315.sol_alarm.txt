The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is updated in the `startExecute` function, but there is no indication that it is properly reset after executing the proposal in the `endExecute` function, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as `internal` but it should be `external` or `public` for proper visibility and ownership management within the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
