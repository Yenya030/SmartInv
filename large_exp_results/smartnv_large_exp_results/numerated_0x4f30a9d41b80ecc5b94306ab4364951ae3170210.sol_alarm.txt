The following contract may have potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, leaving them open to potential mismanagement. 
2) Business logic flaw: The functions "startExecute" and "execute" do not have proper checks for the proposal status, allowing for potential misuse. 
3) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the "votedAmount" without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state. 
4) Atomicity violation: The "execute" function does not ensure atomicity in operations, which may result in race conditions. 
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, potentially leading to Ether leakage issues.
