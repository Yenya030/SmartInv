Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" and "lockedFunds" variables are accessed without specifying their visibility (public/private/internal). This can lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.

2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly in the "execute" function without proper synchronization or validation, which may result in incorrect data representation.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks for a condition based on the balance of the contract, which can consume a significant amount of gas and potentially cause out-of-gas exceptions.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculations involving balances and amounts in the contract are not checked for potential integer overflow/underflow scenarios, which can lead to unexpected results or vulnerabilities.

5) Atomicity violation: The operations in the "startExecute" and "execute" functions are not atomic, meaning that if one operation fails, the contract state may end up in an inconsistent state.

6) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external tokens (votingToken) and may be prone to inconsistencies or vulnerabilities if the external token changes its behavior.

7) Privilege escalation: The "owner" variable is used in the contract, but it's not clear how ownership is managed or whether there are any vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation.

8) Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws in the contract that can be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the contract state or behavior.
