Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal without proper synchronization or atomicity, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal addresses, which could result in conflicts or unintended behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: The functions execute() and endExecute() perform multiple state changes without ensuring atomicity, leaving room for race conditions or unexpected behavior.
