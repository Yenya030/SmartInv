<\output\> 
The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The currentState variable should be private to prevent external manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The currentState can be changed to REFUNDED without the buyer confirming delivery, potentially allowing for undesired refunds.
