The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute which manipulate the state of the proposal struct without ensuring the proper sequence of actions. This can lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations like proposal.votedAmount += amount without checking for potential integer overflow or underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables and functions, which can lead to incorrect access control and ownership issues. It is important to properly define the visibility of functions and variables to prevent unauthorized access.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract includes functions like endExecute that may require a significant amount of gas to execute, which can lead to out-of-gas errors. It is crucial to consider gas limitations when designing and implementing smart contracts.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
