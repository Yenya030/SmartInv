The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any mechanism to ensure that the update is atomic or synchronized, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the operations performed within the contract functions, there is a possibility of running out of gas during execution, especially in functions like "endExecute" where multiple require statements are used.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not explicitly stated whether certain functions should be restricted to only the contract owner or specific users, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
