The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable should be marked as private to prevent unauthorized access outside the contract.
2) Insufficient authorization - The withdrawPayments function should only allow the owner to withdraw funds. This vulnerability may lead to privilege escalation.
3) Ether leakage - The transfer function in withdrawPayments might result in ether being stuck in the contract if the owner does not withdraw the funds.
