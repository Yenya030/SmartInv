1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is being updated directly without any restrictions or checks.

2) Price manipulation: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract allows for potential price manipulation as the liquidation condition is based on a calculation involving the `getPrice` function that is not provided in the contract.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `calculatePrice` function, which calculates the token price, is a state-changing function and should not return a value.

Overall, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Price manipulation
