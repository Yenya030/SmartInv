This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is incremented without any check to ensure that the same proposal cannot be executed multiple times.

2) atomicity violation: The endExecute function includes multiple require statements but does not have a way to revert the changes made if any of the require conditions fail.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the debt and collateral mappings is set to public, potentially exposing sensitive information about user debt and collateral balances.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to state management, transaction atomicity, and data visibility.
