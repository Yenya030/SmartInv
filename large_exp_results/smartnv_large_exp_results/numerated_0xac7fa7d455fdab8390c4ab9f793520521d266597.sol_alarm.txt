The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function requires a high amount of gas due to the calculation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could potentially lead to insufficient gas for the function execution.
