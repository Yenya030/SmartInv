Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions modify the same `proposal` concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but it is not clear if the necessary functions of the interface are implemented correctly. This could lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with external contracts or systems expecting the standard ERC20 interface.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might require a large amount of gas if the `votingToken.totalSupply()` is large, potentially leading to out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function but not defined in the provided code snippet, which could lead to a violation of unique ID requirement.

5) Business logic flaw: The `execute` function transfers `amount` of tokens to the contract without ensuring proper checks for potential integer overflow/underflow, which could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of tokens.
