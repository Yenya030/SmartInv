The contract provided for analysis:
contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public token1;
    IERC20 public token2;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _token1, address _token2) {
        token1 = IERC20(_token1);
        token2 = IERC20(_token2);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function swapTokens(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can swap tokens");
        token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
        token2.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount2);
        token1.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
        token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount1);
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract:
1) reentrancy: The contract lacks checks to prevent reentrancy attacks, allowing malicious contracts to call the swapTokens function repeatedly before the balance updates are completed.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The swapTokens function allows any caller to initiate token swaps, whereas it should only be callable by the owner of the contract based on the require statement.
3) inconsistent state update: The swapTokens function performs token transfers before updating balances, which can lead to inconsistent states if the transfers fail after balances have been deducted.
4) atomicity violation: The swapTokens function does not use a single atomic transaction to ensure that both token transfers occur together, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state if one transfer fails after the other has succeeded.
