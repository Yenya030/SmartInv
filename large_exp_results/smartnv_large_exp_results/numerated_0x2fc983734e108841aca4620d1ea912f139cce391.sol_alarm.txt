The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation (multiple users can have the same ID leading to conflicts).
2) Inconsistent state update (balances are directly modified without proper checks or validations).
3) Insufficient gas (if the contract grows in size, gas costs for depositing or withdrawing funds may become high).
