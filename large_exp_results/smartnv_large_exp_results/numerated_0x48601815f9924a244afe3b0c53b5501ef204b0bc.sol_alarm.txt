Potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseFunds and refundFunds functions allow both the buyer and arbiter to execute the transfer of funds. This may lead to privilege escalation if unintended users gain access to these functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The isFunded variable is set to true in the fundEscrow function, but there are no checks to ensure that the correct conditions are met before changing the state. This can lead to inconsistent state changes.
3) Insufficient gas: If the transfer of funds in the releaseFunds and refundFunds functions consumes too much gas, it may prevent the functions from executing successfully, leading to funds being stuck in the contract.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure that the buyer, seller, and arbiter addresses are unique, which could lead to confusion and potential misuse of the contract.
5) Business logic flaw: The conditions for releasing funds or refunding funds may not be robust enough, allowing for potential exploitation of the escrow system.
