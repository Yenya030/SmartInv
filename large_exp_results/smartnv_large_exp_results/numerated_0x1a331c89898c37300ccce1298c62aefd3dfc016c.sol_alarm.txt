The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenMarket {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalSupply = 1000;
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(balances[owner] >= amount, "Insufficient token balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
        balances[owner] -= amount;
    }

    function transferTokens(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient token balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}

Output:
- insufficient gas
