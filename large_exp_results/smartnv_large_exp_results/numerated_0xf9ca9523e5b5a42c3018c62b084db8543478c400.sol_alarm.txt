The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, making it publicly accessible.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are several functions that update the state of the `proposal` struct, but they do not ensure that the state is consistently updated across different functions.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the execution failed by comparing the total balance to twice the total supply, which may consume a large amount of gas and lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
