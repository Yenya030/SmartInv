The contract you provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawTokens() public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0, "Insufficient balance");
        msg.sender.transfer(balances[msg.sender]);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

There is a potential vulnerability in the contract: incorrect visibility/ownership.
