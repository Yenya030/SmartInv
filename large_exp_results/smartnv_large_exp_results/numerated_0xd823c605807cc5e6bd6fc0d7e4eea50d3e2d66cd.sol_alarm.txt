The provided contract is the following:

```
contract OrderBook {
    mapping(uint => Order) public orders;
    uint public totalOrders;

    struct Order {
        address user;
        uint amount;
        bool executed;
    }

    function createOrder(uint _amount) public {
        totalOrders++;
        orders[totalOrders] = Order(msg.sender, _amount, false);
    }

    function executeOrder(uint _orderId) public {
        require(orders[_orderId].executed == false, "Order already executed");
        // Execute order logic
        orders[_orderId].executed = true;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
