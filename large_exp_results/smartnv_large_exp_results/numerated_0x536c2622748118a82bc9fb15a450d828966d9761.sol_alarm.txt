The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal struct and startingBalanceList without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() attempts to check if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply, which could potentially require too much gas to complete and result in the transaction failing.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not define the necessary functions from the interface, which can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
