Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without properly handling concurrency issues, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, potentially causing issues with contract ownership and accessibility.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas to execute, especially if the `votingToken.transferFrom` operation involves a large amount of tokens, potentially leading to a failure in execution due to insufficient gas.
