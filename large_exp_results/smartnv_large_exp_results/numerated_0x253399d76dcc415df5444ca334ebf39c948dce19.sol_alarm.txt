The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The setTokenPrice function relies solely on msg.sender for authentication, which may lead to privilege escalation if the owner's account is compromised.
2) Price manipulation: The buyTokens function calculates the totalPrice based on user-provided amount and tokenPrice, which may lead to price manipulation attacks by manipulating the amount parameter.
3) Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function transfers tokens to the buyer before transferring the totalPrice to the owner, which may lead to out-of-gas issues if the totalPrice transfer fails after tokens have already been transferred.
