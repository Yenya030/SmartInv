The contract provided for analysis is:
contract Lottery {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    uint public totalBalance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        totalBalance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalBalance -= amount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Integer overflow/underflow: The balances and totalBalance variables are not protected against overflow or underflow, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas limits for operations, which could result in out-of-gas errors.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances and totalBalance variables are public, which exposes sensitive data to all external parties.
- Reentrancy: The withdraw function transfers funds before updating the balance variables, which could make the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
