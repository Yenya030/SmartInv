The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 

- incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables owner, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.
- inconsistent state update: The state variable proposal is updated in the startExecute and execute functions. This could lead to inconsistent or unexpected state changes within the contract.
- insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail to execute if the gas limit is not high enough to complete the necessary operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
- atomicity violation: The execution of multiple operations within the execute function is not atomic, which may lead to race conditions or undesired outcomes if certain operations fail mid-execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and atomicity violation.
