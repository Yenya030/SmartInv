The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks for a condition that involves a significant gas cost (checking if twice the balance is greater than the total supply), which may result in insufficient gas for the operation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership of the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Insufficient gas, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
