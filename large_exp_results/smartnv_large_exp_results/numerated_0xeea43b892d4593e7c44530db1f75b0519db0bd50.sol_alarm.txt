The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable in the "endExecute" function is being updated without proper synchronization, which can lead to issues with inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The "execute" function may fail if the gas provided by the caller is not sufficient for the execution of the function.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "votedProposal" function is not specified, which can lead to potential issues related to function visibility and ownership. 

Overall, the contract may need further review and improvements to address these potential vulnerabilities.
