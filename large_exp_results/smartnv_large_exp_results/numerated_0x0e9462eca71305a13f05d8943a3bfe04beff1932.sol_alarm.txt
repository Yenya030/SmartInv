In the contract provided, potential vulnerabilities include:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'endExecute' function updates the 'lockedFunds' variable based on the balance of the contract, which can be manipulated externally.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as internal, which may lead to visibility issues or unintended access to contract state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
