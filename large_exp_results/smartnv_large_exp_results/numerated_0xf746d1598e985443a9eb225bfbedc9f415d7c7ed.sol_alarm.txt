The contract provided is: 

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
     struct Voter {
          uint256 tokens; 
          address voterAddr; 
     }
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    address public owner;
    uint256 public totalTokens;
    
    function delegate(address _to) external {
        require(voters[_to].voterAddr != address(0), "Delegatee does not exist");
        require(_to != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate to yourself");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voterAddr = _to;
    }
    
    function transferTokens(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {
        require(voters[msg.sender].tokens >= _amount, "Insufficient tokens");
        
        voters[msg.sender].tokens -= _amount;
        voters[_to].tokens += _amount;
    }
    
    function addTokens(uint256 _amount) external {
        voters[msg.sender].tokens += _amount;
        totalTokens += _amount;
    }
    
    function removeTokens(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(voters[msg.sender].tokens >= _amount, "Insufficient tokens");
        
        voters[msg.sender].tokens -= _amount;
        totalTokens -= _amount;
    }
}
```

After analyzing the contract, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) The delegate function lacks proper validation for delegatee existence and self-delegation, which could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
2) The transferTokens function does not handle the possibility of integer underflow, which could lead to vulnerabilities like integer overflow/underflow.
3) It is unclear how the totalTokens are being managed in conjunction with individual voter tokens, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
4) The removeTokens function is similar to transferTokens and may also be susceptible to integer underflow.
