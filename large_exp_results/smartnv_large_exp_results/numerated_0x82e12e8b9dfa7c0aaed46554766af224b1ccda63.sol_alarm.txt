The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
     uint public totalSupply;
     mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;

     function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
         require(totalSupply >= amount, "Not enough tokens to buy");
         balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
         totalSupply -= amount;
     }

     function sellTokens(uint amount) public {
         require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough tokens to sell");
         balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
         totalSupply += amount;
     }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The totalSupply is modified without considering the balance updates, leading to a mismatch in the total token supply and the actual token balances.

2) Integer underflow: If a user tries to sell more tokens than they have, the balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount can cause an underflow issue.

3) Insufficient gas: If the totalSupply becomes very large, adding tokens back to it in sellTokens function could require excessive gas to execute the operation.

So, the potential vulnerabilities identified in the TokenSale contract are inconsistent state update, integer underflow, and insufficient gas.
