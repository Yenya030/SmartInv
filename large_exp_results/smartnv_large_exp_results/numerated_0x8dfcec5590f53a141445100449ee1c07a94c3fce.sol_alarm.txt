The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any additional checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates in the contract.

2) Price manipulation: The function `calculatePrice()` calculates the price based on the balances of tokens in a Uniswap pair contract, which could be manipulated if the balances are controlled by malicious actors.

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of functions that involve external calls, it could lead to the functions failing or not completing as expected.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, price manipulation, and insufficient gas.
