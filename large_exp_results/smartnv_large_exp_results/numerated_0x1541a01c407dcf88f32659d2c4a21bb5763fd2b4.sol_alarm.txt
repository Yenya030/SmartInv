The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votedProposal` function, which could lead to potential unauthorized access or manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `endExecute` function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might not properly ensure the correct state update, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions of the contract, there might be instances where the contract runs out of gas during execution, causing the functions to fail.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposals, which could lead to conflicts or misunderstandings if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously.

5) Suicidal contracts: There is no explicit protection against self-destruct actions or vulnerabilities that could result in the contract being rendered unusable or destroyed.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions and could potentially be susceptible to Ether leakage if not implemented properly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, Insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, Suicidal contracts, and Ether leakage.
