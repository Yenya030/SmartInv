Contract: 

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint[] public proposals;

    function vote(uint proposalId) public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted.");
        voters[msg.sender].vote = proposalId;
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
    }

    function delegate(address to) public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted.");
        require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed.");

        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;

        if (voters[to].voted) {
            proposals[voters[to].vote]++;
        }
    }
}

Output: 
- business logic flaw: The delegate function does not handle the case where the delegate has already voted, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- inconsistent state update: The delegate function updates the state of the sender and the delegate without performing proper checks, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
