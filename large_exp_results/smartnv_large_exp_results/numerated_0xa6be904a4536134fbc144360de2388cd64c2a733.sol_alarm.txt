Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates due to the lack of checks or restrictions on state changes in functions like startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute(). 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is internal which may lead to potential vulnerabilities related to ownership control.
