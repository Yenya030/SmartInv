The contract provided for analysis is:

```
contract Crowdfunding {
    uint totalAmountRaised;
    mapping(address => uint) public contributions;

    function contribute() public payable {
        totalAmountRaised += msg.value;
        contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        uint amount = contributions[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        totalAmountRaised -= amount;
        contributions[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow in the totalAmountRaised variable.
2) Inconsistent state update in the withdrawFunds function.
3) Ether leakage in the call to msg.sender in the withdrawFunds function.
