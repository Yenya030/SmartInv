Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "lockedFunds" is updated in the "endExecute" function without proper checking or validation, potentially leading to inconsistent state or misuse of funds.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the "votingToken" variable, which could lead to potential access control issues or unintended modifications by external contracts.
3) Privilege escalation: The "startExecute" function allows any external caller to initiate a new proposal without proper permission or validation, which can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
4) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of consideration for the gas usage in the contract functions, which may result in out-of-gas errors or failed transactions in certain scenarios.
