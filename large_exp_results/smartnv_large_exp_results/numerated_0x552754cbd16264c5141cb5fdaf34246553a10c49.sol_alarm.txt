Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable lockedFunds is updated in the endExecute function without any proper synchronization mechanism or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The execution of certain functions, like endExecute, may require a significant amount of gas due to the loop that checks the condition, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define visibility for some functions, potentially leaving them susceptible to unintended access or modification.
