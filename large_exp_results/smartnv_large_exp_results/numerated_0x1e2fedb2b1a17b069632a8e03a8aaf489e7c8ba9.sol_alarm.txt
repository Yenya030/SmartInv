Contract analysis:

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute is modifying the state variable proposal.votedAmount without properly updating it, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables votingToken, lockedFunds, startingBalanceList, and proposal are not specified with any visibility modifier, potentially leading to unexpected access and manipulation by external contracts.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation of startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr) if the returned value is too large, causing unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function includes a potentially expensive operation requiring a loop over all balances, which could result in running out of gas and contract execution failure.
5) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function has a condition check based on votingToken balance relative to the total supply, which may not properly reflect the desired business logic and lead to unintended consequences.

Overall vulnerability assessment: The contract contains several potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the system.
