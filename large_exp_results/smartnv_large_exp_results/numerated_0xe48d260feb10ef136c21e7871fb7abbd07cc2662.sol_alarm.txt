The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract PaymentGateway {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentGateway contract:
8) reentrancy
13) insufficient gas
