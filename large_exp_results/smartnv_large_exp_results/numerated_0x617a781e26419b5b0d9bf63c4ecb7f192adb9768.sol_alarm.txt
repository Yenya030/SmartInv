The contract you provided is susceptible to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal by incrementing the votedAmount without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The endExecute function contains multiple require conditions and state updates, which could result in partial execution of the function and potential atomicity violations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of the functions in the contract are not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract state.
