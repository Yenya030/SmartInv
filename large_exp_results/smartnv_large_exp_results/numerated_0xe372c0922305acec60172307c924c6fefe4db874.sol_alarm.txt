The contract for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "User has already voted");
        
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function resetVotes() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can reset votes");
        
        totalVotes = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
            hasVoted[msg.sender] = false;
        }
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect ownership: The "resetVotes" function allows anyone to reset the votes if they know the value of "owner" since it's not defined in the contract. This can lead to privilege escalation.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the "resetVotes" function, the loop to update "hasVoted" mapping is incorrectly using "totalVotes" as the upper limit of the loop instead of the number of voters. This could result in an inconsistent state update.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no overflow protection in the "totalVotes" variable. If the total number of votes reaches the maximum uint value, it could overflow.

4) Inefficient gas usage: The "resetVotes" function can use up a lot of gas due to the loop that resets the voting status of all voters, especially if the contract has a large number of voters.

5) Incorrect visibility: The "owner" variable is not specified in the contract, which can lead to visibility issues and potential vulnerabilities related to who can access and modify the variable.
