Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not include any logic to ensure unique identifiers for proposals. This could lead to issues with tracking and managing different proposals accurately.
2) Atomicity violation: The contract performs multiple state changes in different functions without utilizing mechanisms like mutex or locks to ensure atomicity. This could result in inconsistent or unexpected outcomes if multiple functions are called concurrently.
3) Business logic flaw: The execution of proposals depends on a specific time window and voting process, but there may be potential loopholes or missing validations in the implementation that could be exploited to bypass these requirements.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, which could lead to potential security risks related to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical aspects of the contract.
