Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is called in the `execute` function, but the visibility or ownership of this function is not provided in the code snippet. This could lead to potential vulnerabilities related to access control.

2) Inconsistent state update: The way in which `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function (using the `+=` operator) can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update this value concurrently.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the `calculatePrice` function of the `ExchangeTokens` contract when calculating `USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) / WETH.balanceOf(address(pair))` as the division may result in overflow or underflow if the values are large.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks for `execution failed` condition but does not provide any mechanism to handle the case where there might be insufficient gas to complete the transaction. This could result in failed execution without proper handling.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are related to incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and insufficient gas.
