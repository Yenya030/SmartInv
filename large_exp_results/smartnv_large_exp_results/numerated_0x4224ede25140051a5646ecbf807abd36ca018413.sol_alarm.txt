The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct variable is being directly updated in the `startExecute` function without any checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `owner` variables are marked as internal, which might not be the intended visibility for these variables. It could lead to unexpected behavior or access control issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
