The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract Auction {
        uint public highestBid;
        address public highestBidder;
        address public owner;
        uint public auctionEndTime;

        function startAuction() public {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can start auction");
            auctionEndTime = block.timestamp + 86400; // 24 hours
        }

        function bid() public payable {
            require(block.timestamp < auctionEndTime, "Auction has ended");
            require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
            if (highestBid != 0) {
                payable(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid);
            }
            highestBid = msg.value;
            highestBidder = msg.sender;
        }

        function endAuction() public {
            require(block.timestamp >= auctionEndTime, "Auction has not ended yet");
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can end auction");
            address _this = address(this);
            payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
}
```

Output:
