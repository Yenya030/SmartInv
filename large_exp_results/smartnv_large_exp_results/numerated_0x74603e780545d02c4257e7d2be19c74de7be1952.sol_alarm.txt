The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSale {
         IERC20 public token;
         address public owner;
         uint public price;
         uint public totalTokens;
         mapping(address => uint) public balances;
         
         function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
             uint cost = amount * price;
             require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Not enough tokens available");
             require(msg.value >= cost, "Insufficient payment");
             
             token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
             balances[msg.sender] += amount;
         }
         
         function withdrawEther() public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
             msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
         }
     }

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
