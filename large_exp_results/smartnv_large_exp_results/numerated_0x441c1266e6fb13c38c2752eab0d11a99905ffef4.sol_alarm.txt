The potential vulnerabilities in the contract below are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility modifiers for the functions, which can lead to accessibility issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without clear validation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" statement in the "execute" function does not include proper overflow/underflow checks, leaving the contract vulnerable to integer overflow.
4) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may fail due to exhaustion of gas if the loop to check the balance condition consumes too much gas.
5) Inconsistent state update: The "startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance;" assignment in the "startExecute" function could lead to inconsistent state updates if the starting balance value is not correctly handled.
