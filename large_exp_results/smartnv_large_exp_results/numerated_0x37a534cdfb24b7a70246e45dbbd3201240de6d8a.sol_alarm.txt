The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The execution of the "endExecute()" function may fail if the gas provided is not enough to cover the required operations.
4) Business logic flaw: The calculation of "lockedFunds" in the "endExecute()" function may not accurately reflect the intended logic of the contract.
