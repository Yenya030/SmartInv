potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state of the proposal without ensuring that the previous proposal has been completed or deleted, potentially leading to multiple ongoing proposals.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if the gas limit is not set appropriately for the execution of the required operations.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
