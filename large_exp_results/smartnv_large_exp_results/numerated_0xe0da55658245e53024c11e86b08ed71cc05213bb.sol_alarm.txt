Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without properly checking if the proposal is in an ongoing state, potentially leading to incorrect data manipulation.

2) Privilege escalation: The owner of the contract does not have specific access control measures in place, allowing potential privilege escalation attacks.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, certain functions within the contract may fail due to running out of gas.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions could be inappropriate, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of data. Ownership control is not explicitly defined, which could lead to ownership disputes or unauthorized access.
