Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal's votedAmount without considering the possibility of multiple transactions being processed at the same time, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which may not provide the intended access control and visibility.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the operations performed in functions like endExecute(), there is a risk of running out of gas, especially if the contract needs to perform calculations or transfers involving a large number of tokens.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal IDs, which can lead to potential conflicts or confusion if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.
