The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentContract are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership checks in the makePayment and withdrawPayment functions might be incorrect, allowing unauthorized users to make payments or withdraw funds.
- insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the transfer process in the withdrawPayment function, leading to the failure of transferring funds.
- atomicity violation: There is no atomicity in the paymentAmount update process, which might lead to potential issues if multiple transactions are trying to update it simultaneously.
