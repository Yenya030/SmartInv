The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has functions that update state variables (e.g., proposal.votedAmount) without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for functions and state variables, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation by external contracts.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a significant amount of gas if the condition in the require statement is not met, potentially leading to out-of-gas exceptions.

4) Possible reentrancy vulnerability: Depending on the implementation of external functions such as transferFrom, there might be a risk of reentrancy attacks if not handled properly.

5) Potential arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function could be susceptible to arithmetic flaws if not handled correctly with respect to division and multiplication operations.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, possible reentrancy vulnerability, and potential arithmetic flaw.
