The contract excerpt provided is:

contract Marketplace {
    struct Product {
        uint productId;
        address owner;
        string name;
        uint price;
        bool isSold;
    }

    mapping(uint => Product) public products;
    uint public productCounter;

    function createProduct(string memory _name, uint _price) public {
        productCounter++;
        products[productCounter] = Product(productCounter, msg.sender, _name, _price, false);
    }

    function buyProduct(uint _productId) public payable {
        require(products[_productId].productId != 0, "Product does not exist");
        require(!products[_productId].isSold, "Product already sold");
        require(msg.value == products[_productId].price, "Incorrect amount sent");

        products[_productId].owner.transfer(msg.value);
        products[_productId].owner = msg.sender;
        products[_productId].isSold = true;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The productCounter variable increments without any check for surpassing its maximum value, which can lead to integer overflow.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner of a product can be changed through the buyProduct function, potentially leading to ownership disputes.
3) Insufficient gas: Transfer operations within the buyProduct function could fail, leading to the entire transaction failing due to insufficient gas.
4) Atomicity violation: The state updates in the buyProduct function are not done atomically, which can lead to inconsistent state changes if any of the operations fail.
5) Inconsistent state update: The isSold status of a product is updated after transferring ownership, which can lead to inconsistencies if the transfer fails after updating isSold.
