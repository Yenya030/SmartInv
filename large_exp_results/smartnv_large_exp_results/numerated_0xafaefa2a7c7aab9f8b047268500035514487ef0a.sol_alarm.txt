The contract is prone to potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if it's already initialized, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The `proposal` struct is declared as a public variable, which may expose sensitive information outside the contract boundaries.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The `execute` function may require more gas than available in certain scenarios, leading to execution failure.

4) Arithmetic flaw:
- The calculation in the `liquidate` function might lead to arithmetic flaws due to the division operation and might result in unexpected behavior or errors. 

5) Cross-bridge inconsistency:
- The contract interacts with multiple external contracts (e.g., `votingToken`, `WETH`, `USDC`), which can lead to cross-bridge inconsistencies if not handled properly.

6) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The `proposal` struct and `lockedFunds` variable are declared without appropriate visibility/ownership modifiers, potentially exposing sensitive data publicly.

7) Atomicity violation:
- The update of the `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function is not atomic, which may lead to race conditions or unexpected results in concurrent executions.
