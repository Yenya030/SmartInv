The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility for the `lockedFunds` variable, making it potentially accessible from external contracts, posing a security risk.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency in the state update of the `proposal` struct, especially in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes without using any form of atomicity mechanisms, which could result in inconsistent state updates if an error occurs midway through the function execution.
4) Business logic flaw: The logic for determining when a proposal can be executed in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions may not accurately reflect the intended behavior, potentially leading to undesired outcomes.
5) Ether leakage: There does not appear to be any explicit handling of Ether transactions in the contract, which could potentially lead to unintentional loss of Ether by sending it to unintended recipients or contracts.
6) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider or handle scenarios where gas costs for transactions may exceed the gas limit, potentially causing transactions to fail or get stuck.
