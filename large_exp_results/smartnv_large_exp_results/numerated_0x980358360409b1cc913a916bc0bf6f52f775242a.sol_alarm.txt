The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract SimpleToken {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
    }

    function getBalance(address _addr) public view returns (uint) {
        return balances[_addr];
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not handle potential overflow or underflow in the balance calculations, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the balance reaches extreme values.

2) Inconsistent state update: The transfer function modifies balances without performing consistency checks or ensuring atomic updates, which can lead to inconsistent state of the balances.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, which exposes sensitive data to all users of the contract without proper access control mechanisms.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
