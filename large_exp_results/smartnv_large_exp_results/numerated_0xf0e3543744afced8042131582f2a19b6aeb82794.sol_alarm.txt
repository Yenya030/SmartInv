Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that it is properly synchronized with the contract state.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` checks a condition that involves calling the `balanceOf` function of the `votingToken` contract, which may consume a significant amount of gas and lead to out-of-gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility: The state variables `votingToken` and `owner` are marked as internal, which may lead to potential visibility issues.
4) Privilege escalation: The function `startExecute` allows any caller to create a new proposal without proper authorization checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation issues.
