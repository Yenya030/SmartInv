The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBalanceList` without checking whether the proposal is valid, leading to inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may fail if the gas limit is not sufficient to complete the execution, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is internal, which could lead to potential issues if external contracts need to interact with it.
