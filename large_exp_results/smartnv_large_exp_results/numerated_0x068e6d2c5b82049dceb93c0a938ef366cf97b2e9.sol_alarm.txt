The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function ``proposal.votedAmount += amount;`` directly updates the state variable ``votedAmount`` without proper checks or validation.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The function ``lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));`` assigns the balance of the contract to a state variable without proper validations, which can lead to inconsistencies in the bridge.

3) Insufficient gas: There's a possibility of running out of gas during the contract execution due to multiple state updates and complex operations.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of some variables and functions is not explicitly defined, which can lead to potential security risks.
