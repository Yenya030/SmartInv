Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions in the contract, which can lead to potential security risks.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state updates in the functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() where variables like proposal.sTime, proposal.votedAmount, and lockedFunds are updated without proper synchronization, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is a lack of checks for ID uniqueness in the startExecute() function when setting the new proposal struct, which can result in unexpected behavior if multiple proposals are created simultaneously with the same ID.

4) Reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks as there are instances where external calls are made to other contracts without proper checks and handling for reentrancy.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow/underflow in the execute() function where proposal.votedAmount is incremented by the amount parameter without proper validation checks, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not have proper checks and sanitization in place while transferring tokens, which can lead to potential ether leakage if the transfer functions are susceptible to attack.

7) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may face issues with insufficient gas if the execution of certain operations consumes more gas than available, potentially causing the transaction to fail unexpectedly. 

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the smart contract system.
