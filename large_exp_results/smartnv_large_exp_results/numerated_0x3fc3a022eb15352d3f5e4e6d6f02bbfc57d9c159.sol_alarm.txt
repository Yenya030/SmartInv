Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is being incremented without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as public, potentially revealing sensitive information publicly.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may consume a large amount of gas if the `uint totalSupply()` function call is expensive, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
4) Suicidal contracts: There is no check to prevent someone from calling the `startExecute` function multiple times, potentially causing exhaustion of resources and leading to a suicidal contract scenario.

Overall, there are potential vulnerabilities in the contract that need to be addressed to ensure its security and robustness.
