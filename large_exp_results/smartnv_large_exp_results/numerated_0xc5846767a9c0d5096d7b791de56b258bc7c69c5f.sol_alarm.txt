The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` field in the `Proposal` struct is being updated directly in the `execute` function, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct is not using any unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to conflicts if there are multiple proposals created at the same time.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might require a large amount of gas if the `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))` is significantly high, potentially causing the function to fail due to insufficient gas.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `votingToken` variable is not specified, potentially making it publicly accessible when it should be private for security reasons.
