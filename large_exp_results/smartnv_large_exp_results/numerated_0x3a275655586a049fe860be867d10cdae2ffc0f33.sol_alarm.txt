Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` includes a statement `lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));`, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if `lockedFunds` is used elsewhere in the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, leaving it potentially accessible from outside the contract. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the proposal data.
