Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Business logic flaw: There is no verification of the arbiter's approval before disbursing the funds, potentially allowing one party to bypass the arbiter's decision.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables buyerApproved, sellerApproved, and fundsDisbursed are public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties.
3) Inconsistent state update: The state variables buyerApproved and sellerApproved can both be set to true independently, allowing funds to be disbursed without mutual agreement from buyer and seller.
