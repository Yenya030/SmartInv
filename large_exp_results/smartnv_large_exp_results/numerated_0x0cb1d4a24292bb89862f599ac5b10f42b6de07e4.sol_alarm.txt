The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables, which could lead to access control issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being directly incremented in the `execute` function without proper checks or validations.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially run out of gas due to the calculation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` which involves a high gas cost operation.
4) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function such as `votingToken.transferFrom` and updating `proposal.votedAmount` are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, which could lead to inconsistencies in state if the second operation fails.
5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could potentially lead to confusion or errors in handling multiple proposals.
