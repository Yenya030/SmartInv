The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` allows for the update of `lockedFunds` without proper checking or validation of the state of the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not define the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which can lead to potential unintended access or manipulation of the proposal data.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas properly, which can lead to transactions failing due to insufficient gas.

4) Ether leakage: There is no check for Ether transactions or handling of Ether in the contract, which can lead to Ether leakage or loss in certain interactions.
