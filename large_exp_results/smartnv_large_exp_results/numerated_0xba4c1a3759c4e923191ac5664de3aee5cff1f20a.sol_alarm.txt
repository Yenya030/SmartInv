Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure that the IDs assigned to proposals are unique.
2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` does not perform the state changes in an atomic manner, which could lead to inconsistencies if multiple transactions are executed concurrently.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable and some functions are declared as `internal`, which might unintentionally expose them and allow unauthorized access.
4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the size of the operations performed in the contract, there might be instances where the contract runs out of gas during execution.
5) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `lockedFunds` are updated without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to incorrect data updates.
