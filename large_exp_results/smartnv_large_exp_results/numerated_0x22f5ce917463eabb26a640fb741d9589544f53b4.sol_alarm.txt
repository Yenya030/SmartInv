Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal without checking if it's already in progress, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow/underflow in the calculation of startingBalance in the startExecute() function.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal visibility of the owner state variable could potentially lead to unauthorized access and manipulation from external contracts.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
