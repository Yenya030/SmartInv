The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `endExecute()` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable, but it's not clear how this variable is being used or handled elsewhere in the contract. This could lead to inconsistent state updates or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility: The `votedProposal()` function is referenced in the `execute()` function without being defined in the contract. This could lead to an incorrect visibility or ownership issue if the `votedProposal()` function is intended to be a part of the contract but is not properly implemented.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
