The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `lockFunds` updates the state variable `lockedFunds` without considering reentrancy issues or possible race conditions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` are not explicitly defined with access control modifiers such as `private` or `internal`, making them publicly accessible and modifiable.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The arithmetic operations in the `execute` function involving `proposal.votedAmount` can potentially lead to integer overflow if the total voted amount exceeds the maximum uint256 value.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Integer overflow/underflow.
