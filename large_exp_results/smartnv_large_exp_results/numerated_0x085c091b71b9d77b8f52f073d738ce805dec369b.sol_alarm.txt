The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute()` and `execute()` functions, there is a lack of proper state update management, and variables are modified without proper checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may run out of gas if the gas limit is reached due to the large computation involved in checking the balance and executing the logic.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of validation for integer calculations in the `liquidate()` function, which can potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow issues.
