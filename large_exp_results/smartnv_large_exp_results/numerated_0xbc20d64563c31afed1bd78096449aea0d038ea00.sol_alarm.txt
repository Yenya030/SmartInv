1) The contract contains a privilege escalation vulnerability as it allows the `startExecute` function to be called by any external account without proper authorization or access control mechanisms in place. This could lead to unauthorized parties initiating proposals and potentially manipulating the execution process.

2) The contract may be vulnerable to a business logic flaw as the `endExecute` function determines the execution success based on a simplistic comparison between the balance of locked funds and the total supply of the token. This logic may not accurately reflect the actual successful execution of proposals and could result in inconsistent outcomes.

3) Insufficient gas appears to be a potential vulnerability in the contract, especially during the execution process where multiple token transfers are involved. If the gas limit is not set appropriately, the contract execution may run out of gas, leading to transaction failures or incomplete operations.

4) There is a potential risk of inconsistent state update vulnerability when updating the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or atomicity guarantees. Concurrent executions of the `execute` function may result in race conditions and inconsistent state updates.

5) The contract may be prone to incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability as the ownership of critical functions and data structures is not explicitly defined or protected within the contract. Unauthorized parties could potentially access or modify critical contract components.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Privilege escalation
- Business logic flaw
- Insufficient gas
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
