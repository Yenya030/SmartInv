The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public escrowAmount;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter) public {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit");
        escrowAmount += msg.value;
    }

    function releaseAmount(address payable to) public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release amount");
        to.transfer(escrowAmount);
        escrowAmount = 0;
    }

    function refundAmount() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund amount");
        buyer.transfer(escrowAmount);
        escrowAmount = 0;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `releaseAmount` and `refundAmount` functions should have restrictions based on the `seller` and `arbiter` addresses to ensure proper ownership and permissions. This vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation.
2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas limits which might result in out-of-gas errors during execution.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update if `escrowAmount` is not properly handled in all functions.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow/underflow in the calculation and manipulation of `escrowAmount`.
