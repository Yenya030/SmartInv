Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly in the "execute" function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract claims to implement the IERC20 interface but doesn't provide any of the required functions, leading to incorrect visibility and potentially causing issues with ownership.
3) Insufficient gas: The "execute" function performs token transfers but doesn't handle potential out-of-gas scenarios, which could result in transaction failure.
