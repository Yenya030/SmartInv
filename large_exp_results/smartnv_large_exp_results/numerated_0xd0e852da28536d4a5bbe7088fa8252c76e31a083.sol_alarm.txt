Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the proposal struct, but it does not update the sTime field to mark the proposal as ongoing. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute()` updates the proposal struct, but it does not update the votedAmount field to indicate that the voting process has gone through. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20, but it does not provide implementations for the required functions. This can lead to incorrect visibility issues.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function calculates a condition that involves interacting with external contracts (votingToken), which can consume a significant amount of gas. If there is not enough gas provided, the function may fail to execute.
