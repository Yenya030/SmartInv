Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` in the `execute` function can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are executed simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not specified with a visibility modifier, which can potentially lead to unexpected behavior and misuse of the data.
3) Insufficient gas: The operations within the `execute` and `endExecute` functions might require more gas than is provided, leading to execution failures or incomplete actions.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `endExecute` function uses `lockedFunds` without initializing it, potentially leading to issues with ID uniqueness if multiple executions occur without proper handling.
