Potential vulnerabilities in the contract above:
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is updated in `startExecute()` and `execute()` functions without setting `votedAmount` to `0` in `startExecute()` which could lead to inconsistent data.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is public which may expose sensitive data to external parties.
- Insufficient gas: The operations performed in `endExecute()` require a significant amount of gas which may cause the function to fail if there is insufficient gas provided.
- Business logic flaw: The requirement `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) * 2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` may not accurately determine the execution status based on fund availability.
