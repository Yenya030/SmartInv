The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The variable "lockedFunds" is being updated in the endExecute() function without proper checks or constraints, potentially causing inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The function startExecute() is externally accessible, but it seems like it should be restricted to only the contract owner. This could lead to privilege escalation if not properly controlled.

3) Possible reentrancy issue: 
   - The execute() function transfers tokens without using any checks to prevent reentrancy attacks, which could lead to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Possible reentrancy issue.
