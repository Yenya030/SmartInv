The contract provided for analysis: 

contract PaymentGateway {
         uint256 public totalPayments;
         mapping(address => uint256) public userPayments;

         function makePayment() external payable {
             require(msg.value > 0, "Payment must be greater than 0");
             totalPayments += msg.value;
             userPayments[msg.sender] += msg.value;
         }

         function withdraw() external {
             uint256 amount = userPayments[msg.sender];
             require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
             userPayments[msg.sender] = 0;
             msg.sender.transfer(amount);
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
- Integer overflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the totalPayments counter if the sum of payments exceeds the maximum value representable by a uint256.
- Insufficient gas: If a user attempts to withdraw funds but does not have enough gas for the transfer operation, the withdrawal will fail and could potentially lock their funds.
- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle re-entrancy properly, allowing for potential re-entrancy attacks that could result in ether leakage.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions makePayment and withdraw are currently set to external visibility, which exposes them to potential unauthorized access by external contracts. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow
2) Insufficient gas
3) Ether leakage
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership
