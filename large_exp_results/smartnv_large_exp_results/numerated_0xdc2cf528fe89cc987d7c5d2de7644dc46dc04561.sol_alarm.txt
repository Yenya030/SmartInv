In the contract provided, potential vulnerabilities include:
3) business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as it relies on a fixed percentage (80%) for determining if a user's fund can be liquidated.
6) cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential for cross-bridge inconsistency in the ExchangeTokens contract if the balances of USDC and WETH in the Uniswap pair are manipulated.
10) arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have an arithmetic flaw as it performs division without handling potential division by zero errors.
