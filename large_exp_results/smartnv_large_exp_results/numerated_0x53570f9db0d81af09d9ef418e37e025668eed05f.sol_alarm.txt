Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update in the execute function where the voted amount is updated without any synchronization mechanism, which could lead to incorrect state changes.
2) Integer underflow: There is a risk of integer underflow in the liquidate function where the calculation of getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 might result in a value lower than expected due to underflow.
