Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute()` function, but it is not clear how this variable is being used or what impact it has on the contract state.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate()` function could potentially result in arithmetic flaws or unintended behavior if the values being multiplied exceed the maximum integer range.
3) Insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice()` function performs a division operation, which can consume a significant amount of gas and potentially result in out-of-gas errors if used excessively.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in this contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Arithmetic flaw
- Insufficient gas
