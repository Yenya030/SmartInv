The contract provided for analysis:

contract Vesting {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint) public vestedAmounts;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vestTokens(address beneficiary, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can vest tokens");
        vestedAmounts[beneficiary] += amount;
    }

    function releaseTokens(address beneficiary) public {
        uint amount = vestedAmounts[beneficiary];
        vestedAmounts[beneficiary] = 0;
        // transfer tokens to beneficiary
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Privilege escalation: The vestTokens function allows only the admin to vest tokens but does not restrict multiple vesting for the same beneficiary.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to view and potentially manipulate the admin address.
