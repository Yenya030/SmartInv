Contract:
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint voteIndex;
    }
    
    struct Proposal {
        uint voteCount;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    Proposal[] public proposals;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");
        require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed.");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Loop detected.");
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
    }

    function vote(uint proposalIndex) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.voteIndex = proposalIndex;
        proposals[proposalIndex].voteCount += 1;
    }
}
Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The proposals array should be private to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure the uniqueness of proposal indexes, which could lead to confusion or incorrect vote counting.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of proper synchronization when updating the state of voters, potentially leading to race condition issues.
4) Business logic flaw: There might be a flaw in the logic of delegation as it does not handle all possible scenarios, which could result in unexpected behavior.
5) Atomicity violation: The operations within the vote function are not atomic, meaning that if an external contract triggers multiple votes simultaneously, the state may not be updated correctly.
