Given the contract provided:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  

    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 
        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 
        }

    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The startExecute() function initializes the proposal struct, but it contains a typo where "startingBalance" should be assigned to instead of "startingBlance".
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to incorrect access control logic if not properly managed.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
