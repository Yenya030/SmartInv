Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated based on the balance of the contract `address(this)`, which may not always accurately represent the locked funds due to potential external transfers. It could lead to incorrect calculations or decisions based on inaccurate data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `startingBalanceList` variables are not specified as public or internal, making their visibility unclear. This can potentially lead to unintended behavior or access control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The functions `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` perform multiple state changes and transactions, which could result in running out of gas during execution and leaving the contract in an inconsistent state. It's important to ensure that there is enough gas for all operations to be completed successfully.
