Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) atomicity violation: The functions in the contract do not have mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are processed concurrently.

2) inconsistent state update: There are various state variables being updated within functions without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

3) insufficient gas: The functions in the contract make external calls to other contracts without specifying enough gas limit, potentially causing the transactions to run out of gas and fail.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly define the visibility of certain functions and variables, making it difficult to determine who has access to them and potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
