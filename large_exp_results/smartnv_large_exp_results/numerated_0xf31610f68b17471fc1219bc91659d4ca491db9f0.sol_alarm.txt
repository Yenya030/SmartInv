Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is being directly incremented without proper checks or validation, which could lead to incorrect state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "lockedFunds" variable is not specified with any visibility modifier (public, private, internal, external), which could potentially lead to accessibility issues or unintended modifications.
