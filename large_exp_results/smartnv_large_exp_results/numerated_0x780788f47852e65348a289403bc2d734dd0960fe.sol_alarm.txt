The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities including:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the state variables owner, votingToken, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the function startExecute and execute rely on the state variable "proposal" being updated correctly, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled properly.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may run out of gas if the contract's balance is close to zero, which could prevent the execution of the function.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
