The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        uint totalAmount = amount * price;
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalAmount, "Not enough tokens in the contract");
        
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Price manipulation: The price is set at deployment and can potentially be manipulated by the owner.
2) Incorrect ownership: Only the owner address is stored, but no additional checks are performed to ensure that only the owner can perform specific actions.
