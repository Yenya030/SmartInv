The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state of the proposal struct without checking if a proposal is already in progress, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal ID, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute performs a complex calculation to check if the execution failed, which could consume a large amount of gas and potentially fail in low gas conditions.
