The potential vulnerabilities in the contract could be:
- Reentrancy: The function `bid()` allows for transferring funds to `highestBidder` before updating their details, which can make the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
- Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update if multiple bids are submitted simultaneously and the contract does not handle this scenario properly.
