The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, which can lead to potential issues with ownership and accessibility.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to insufficient gas for completing the transaction.
4) Atomicity violation: In the `endExecute` function, multiple state changes are being performed without proper atomicity guarantees, which can result in inconsistencies in the contract state.

As a result, the contract provided contains potential vulnerabilities related to visibility/ownership, inconsistent state updates, insufficient gas, and atomicity violation.
