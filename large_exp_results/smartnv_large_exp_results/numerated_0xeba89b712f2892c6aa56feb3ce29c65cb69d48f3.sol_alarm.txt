The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
     IERC20 public token;
     mapping(address => uint) public votes;

     function vote(uint amount) public {
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
         votes[msg.sender] += amount;
     }

     function redeem() public {
         uint amount = votes[msg.sender];
         token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         votes[msg.sender] = 0;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Insufficient gas: There is a risk that the contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions due to potentially costly operations.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of functions and variables in the contract may not be appropriately secured, leading to potential security risks.
