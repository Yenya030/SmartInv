Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the variables `owner` and `votingToken`, making them publicly accessible.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency in the state update of the `execute` function where the `proposal.votedAmount` is increased but not properly handled or validated.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to insufficient gas if the `require` condition checking for the execution failure consumes a large amount of gas.
4) Business logic flaw: There may be a flaw in the business logic of the `endExecute` function as it checks if the total balance of the contract is greater than two times the total supply of the voting token, which may not make sense in all scenarios.
