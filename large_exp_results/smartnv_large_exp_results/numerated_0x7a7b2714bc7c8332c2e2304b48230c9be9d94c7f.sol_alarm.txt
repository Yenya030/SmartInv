The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any external account to initiate a new proposal, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
2) inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without any check, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes (transfer and voting), which may result in atomicity violations if an error occurs midway.
4) ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions properly, potentially leading to ether leakage.
5) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership management.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, ether leakage, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
