Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function, but it is not defined in the contract. This could lead to an incorrect behavior or potential vulnerability if the function is supposed to have specific access control or visibility.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented by the amount transferred from the `votingToken`. However, there is no check or validation to ensure that the transferred amount matches the expected `amount`. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function transfers tokens from the `proposal.addr` to the contract address, and then updates the `proposal.votedAmount`. If the `votingToken.transferFrom` or any subsequent operations consume a significant amount of gas, it could result in insufficient gas for completing the function execution, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

In summary, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Insufficient gas
