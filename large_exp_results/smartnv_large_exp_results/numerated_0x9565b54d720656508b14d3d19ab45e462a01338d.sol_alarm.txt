The contract provided in the question is: 

```solidity
contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public admin;
    mapping(uint => uint) public payments;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function processPayment(uint _id, uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can process payments");
        payments[_id] = _amount;
    }

    function getPayment(uint _id) public view returns (uint) {
        return payments[_id];
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Privilege escalation: The `processPayment` function only checks if the caller is the admin but doesn't restrict access to only the admin. Any address can become the admin if it calls the constructor before the rightful admin. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to see the current admin address. This can potentially expose sensitive information.

3) Business logic flaw: There is no condition to check if a payment with the same ID already exists before processing a new payment. This could lead to inconsistent state updates and potential issues with payment processing logic.
