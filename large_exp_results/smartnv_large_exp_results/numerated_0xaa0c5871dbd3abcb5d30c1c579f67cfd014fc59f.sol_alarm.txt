Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` variables, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is mentioned in the code snippet but not defined, which could lead to potential ID uniqueness violations.
3) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in the functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent states.
4) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple operations sequentially without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to unexpected behavior if any operation fails in between.
