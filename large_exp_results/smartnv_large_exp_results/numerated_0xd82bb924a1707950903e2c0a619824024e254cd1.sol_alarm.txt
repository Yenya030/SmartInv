 The potential vulnerabilities in <\contract_3\> are:
 - Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes the owner's address to the public. It would be more secure to keep it private and implement proper access control mechanisms.
 - Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation of price as amount * 2 could potentially cause an integer overflow if the amount is very large, leading to unexpected behavior.
 - Insufficient gas: If the buyTokens function requires a significant amount of gas to execute, there might be a risk of out-of-gas errors, especially if a user tries to buy a large amount of tokens.
