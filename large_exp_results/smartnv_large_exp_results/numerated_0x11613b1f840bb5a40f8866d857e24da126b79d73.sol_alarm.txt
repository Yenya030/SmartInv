This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variables based on the balance of the contract, but it doesn't consider potential changes in the balance due to external interactions before executing the require statement.

2) atomicity violation: The execute() function doesn't have safeguards to ensure that all operations inside the function are executed atomically. For example, the transferFrom and the updating of votedAmount variable should be handled atomically.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal addresses, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the ownership and visibility requirements for certain functions are appropriately set based on the code snippet provided. This ambiguity could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
