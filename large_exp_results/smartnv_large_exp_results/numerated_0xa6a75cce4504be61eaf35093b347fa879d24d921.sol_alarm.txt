The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: In the endExecute function, the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");" may not accurately reflect the intended business logic, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There are no explicit checks to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or errors in the system.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions is not specified, which could lead to access control issues or unintended operations.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, allowing potential vulnerabilities related to ether leakage.
