The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any protection against multiple calls. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple calls are made simultaneously.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal()` function is mentioned in the code snippet but its visibility and ownership are not defined in the contract. This can lead to issues with accessibility and ownership control.

3) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit for transactions calling the functions in this contract is not set appropriately, there is a risk of running out of gas, which could prevent the contract from executing successfully.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculations in the `liquidate()` function involving debt and collateral amounts could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled, leading to unexpected behaviors.
