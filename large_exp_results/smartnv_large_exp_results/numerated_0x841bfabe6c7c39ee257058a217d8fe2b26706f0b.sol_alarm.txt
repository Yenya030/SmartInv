The contract you are going to analyze and output potential vulnerabilities for is:

contract EscrowContract {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;

    uint public price;

    enum State { AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE }

    State public currentState;

    constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _price) {
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        price = _price;
        currentState = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit");
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect deposit amount");
        // Logic for deposit 
        currentState = State.AWAITING_DELIVERY;
    }

    function confirmDelivery() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "Only buyer or seller can confirm delivery");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Incorrect state for delivery confirmation");
        // Logic for confirming delivery 
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can request refund");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Incorrect state for refund request");
        // Logic for refund request 
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
    }
} 

The potential vulnerabilities in the EscrowContract are:
1) Incorrect state update
2) Inconsistent state update
