The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to security issues.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mention or implementation of unique identifiers for proposals or other elements, which can result in ID duplication and potential issues.
3) Atomicity violation: The contract does not handle atomicity properly, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential vulnerabilities.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations in the contract that involve manipulating uint values without proper overflow/underflow checks, which can lead to vulnerabilities.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, potentially leading to ether leakage vulnerabilities.
