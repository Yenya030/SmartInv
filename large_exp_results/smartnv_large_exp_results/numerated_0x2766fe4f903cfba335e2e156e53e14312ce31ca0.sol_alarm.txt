The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without explicitly defining it in the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute()` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring atomicity which can lead to unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but it does not properly define the required functions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
