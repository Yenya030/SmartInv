Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any proper check or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled correctly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `owner` variable, which could potentially lead to issues related to ownership control and access.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks the balance of the contract and total supply of the token, which could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors if the contract balance or token supply is large.
