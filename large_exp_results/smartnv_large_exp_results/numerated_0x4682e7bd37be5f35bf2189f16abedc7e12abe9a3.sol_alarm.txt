This contract may have potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Inconsistent state update: in the function 'startExecute', 'proposal' is being updated without checking if there is an ongoing proposal, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Insufficient gas: the function 'endExecute' might require too much gas for the 'lockedFunds' calculation, potentially leading to transaction failures due to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
