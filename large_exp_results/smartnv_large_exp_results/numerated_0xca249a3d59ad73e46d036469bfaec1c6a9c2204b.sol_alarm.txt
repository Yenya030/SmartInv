The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions are all declared as `external`, which means they can only be called from outside the contract. This might not be the intended behavior and could lead to issues if the contract's owner was supposed to have exclusive access to these functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` statement in the `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` without any checks for overflow or ensuring that the voting process is carried out correctly.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is insufficient gas to complete the operation, as it performs a complex calculation that relies on the balance of `address(this)`.
4) Atomicity violation: The state updates in the `startExecute` and `endExecute` functions could potentially be interrupted or reordered, leading to inconsistency in the contract state.
