The following contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update:
- The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBlance` and `startingBalanceList` variables but does not have a clear reason for updating them separately. This could lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide any implementation for the required functions. This could lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect the standard ERC20 interface.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
