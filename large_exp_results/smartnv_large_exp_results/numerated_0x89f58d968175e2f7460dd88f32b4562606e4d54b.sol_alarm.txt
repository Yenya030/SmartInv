- The contract contains a potential vulnerability of privilege escalation because there is no access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to specific roles or users.
- The contract also has a potential vulnerability of inconsistent state update as it may not properly handle or update the state of proposals and balances.
- There is a potential vulnerability of insufficient gas as certain functions might require more gas than expected, leading to failed transactions or unexpected behavior.
