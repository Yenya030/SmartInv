The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow in the `liquidate` function where the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` may result in overflow or underflow.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership in the `calculatePrice` function as it is set to public and may expose sensitive data about the contract's balance.
