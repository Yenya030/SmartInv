Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state without checking if there is an existing proposal or not, potentially overwriting an ongoing proposal.

2) Inconsistent state update: The variable `startingBlance` is misspelled as `startingBlance` in the `startExecute()` function, which may cause incorrect state updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is internal, which may expose the contract to risks related to visibility and ownership control.

4) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` may require more gas than available due to the requirement `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no guarantee of uniqueness for the `addr` parameter in the `Proposal` struct, which could lead to ambiguity or conflicts.

6) Integer overflow/underflow: The increment operation `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` in the `execute()` function may result in integer overflow if not handled properly.

7) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBalanceList` mapping is not specified with a visibility keyword, potentially causing issues related to visibility and access control.

8) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not specified with a visibility keyword, which may lead to issues related to visibility and access control.

9) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute()` function regarding the balance check could potentially be flawed and may not ensure accurate execution outcomes.

10) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract may require varying amounts of gas, and insufficient gas allocation could lead to transaction failures or incomplete execution.

11) Missing input validation: The contract lacks input validation mechanisms, such as checking for valid addresses or values, which could result in unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities.

12) Potential for ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions explicitly, leaving a potential vulnerability for accidental or malicious loss of Ether.

13) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have any self-destruct mechanism, which may lead to the inability to recover funds or disable the contract if needed.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, integer overflow/underflow, business logic flaw, missing input validation, potential for ether leakage, and suicidal contracts.
