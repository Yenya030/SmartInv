The contract provided for analysis:

              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is no visible connection to the bridge that ensures consistency in data flow between the contract and external systems.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of variables and functions are not explicitly defined, opening up the contract to potential unauthorized access or manipulation.
3) Inconsistent state update: The state update in functions like startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() may not be consistent, leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow/underflow in operations involving uint256 variables, which can result in incorrect calculations or exploitation.
5) Insufficient gas: Certain operations like transferring tokens may require more gas than allocated, leading to transaction failures or incomplete executions.
6) Business logic flaw: The overall business logic of the contract may have flaws or inconsistencies that could be exploited by malicious actors for financial gain or disruption.

Output: 
Cross bridge inconsistency, incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas, business logic flaw.
