The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without clearing any previous value, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `debt`, `collateral`, `WETH`, `USDC`, and `pair` are declared as public, which exposes sensitive data and functionality to all external parties.

3) Insufficient gas: The `liquidate` function, if called with large amounts of data, may require excessive gas to execute, potentially exceeding the block gas limit.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
