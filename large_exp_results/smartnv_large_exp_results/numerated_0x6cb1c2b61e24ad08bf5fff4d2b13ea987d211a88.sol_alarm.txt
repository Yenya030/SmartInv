The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is as follows:

contract Auction {
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than the current highest bid");
        if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
            bids[highestBidder] += highestBid;
            highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Output: 
- potential inconsistency state update
- potential reentrancy.
