The contract provided for analysis is:
```solidity
contract Lottery {
    address public manager;
    address[] public players;

    constructor() {
        manager = msg.sender;
    }

    function enter() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0.01 ether, "Minimum entry fee is 0.01 ether");
        players.push(msg.sender);
    }

    function random() private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players)));
    }

    function pickWinner() public restricted {
        require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can pick a winner");
        require(players.length > 0, "No players to pick a winner from");

        uint index = random() % players.length;
        address winner = players[index];
        address(manager).transfer(address(this).balance);

        players = new address[](0);
    }

    modifier restricted {
        _;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Insufficient gas: There could be a risk of running out of gas during the `pickWinner` function, especially if there are a large number of players in the `players` array.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `manager` variable is publicly accessible, and anyone can see who the manager is. This lack of privacy could lead to security risks.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential risk of integer overflow in the `random` function when calculating the index for selecting a winner.
