The contract provided for analysis:

contract Marketplace {
         IERC20 public token;
         uint public totalSupply;
         mapping(address => uint) public balances;
         
         function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
             require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
             uint totalPrice = amount * getPrice();
             require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= totalPrice, "Insufficient balance");
             
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalPrice);
             balances[msg.sender] += amount;
             totalSupply += amount;
         }

         function sellTokens(uint amount) public {
             require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
             require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
             
             uint totalPrice = amount * getPrice();
             token.transfer(msg.sender, totalPrice);
             balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
             totalSupply -= amount;
         }

         function getPrice() public view returns (uint) {
             return (totalSupply > 0) ? token.balanceOf(address(this)) / totalSupply : 0;
         }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract are:
1) Arithmetic flaw: Multiplication in buyTokens and sellTokens functions could lead to arithmetic overflow if the amount is too large.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of balances and totalSupply variables as public could expose sensitive information.
3) Insufficient gas: Operations such as token.transferFrom and token.transfer could require a significant amount of gas, which may result in out-of-gas errors.
4) Atomicity violation: Operations in the buyTokens and sellTokens functions are not atomic, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if an error occurs midway through execution.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract are: 
1) Arithmetic flaw
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
4) Atomicity violation
