The potential vulnerabilities in the contract VotingSystem are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: There is no restriction on who can call the vote function, allowing anyone to vote multiple times. 
- insufficient gas: If the voting logic consumes a lot of gas, it might prevent some users from being able to successfully vote.
