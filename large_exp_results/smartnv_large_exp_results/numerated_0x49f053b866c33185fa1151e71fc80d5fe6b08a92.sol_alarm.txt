Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the `proposal` state in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper validation or synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
   
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function has multiple state-changing operations that are not wrapped in a single transaction, which can lead to atomicity violations if one operation fails while the others succeed.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for the uniqueness of `proposal.addr` when storing it in `startingBalanceList`, which could lead to ID uniqueness violations if the same address is used multiple times.

4) Arithmetic flaw: There is a potential arithmetic flaw in the `liquidate` function where the multiplication of `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` may result in integer overflow/underflow if the values are large.

5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not explicitly specified, which could lead to incorrect visibility settings and potential security vulnerabilities.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions or balances, but if ether is sent to the contract accidentally, it could lead to ether leakage without any recovery mechanism.

7) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include any gas optimization techniques, which could result in Out of Gas errors or higher gas fees for transactions interacting with the contract.
