Contract to be analyzed:

<\example_3\>
contract Lottery {
     address public manager;
     address payable[] public players;

     constructor() {
         manager = msg.sender;
     }

     function enter() public payable {
         require(msg.value > 0.01 ether, "Minimum entry fee is 0.01 ether");
         players.push(msg.sender);
     }

     function random() private view returns (uint) {
         return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players)));
     }

     function pickWinner() public restricted {
         uint index = random() % players.length;
         players[index].transfer(address(this).balance);
         players = new address payable[](0);
     }

     modifier restricted() {
         require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can call this function");
         _;
     }
}
