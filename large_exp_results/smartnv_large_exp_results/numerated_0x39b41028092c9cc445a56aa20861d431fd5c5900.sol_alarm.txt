This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not have proper checks for updating the state of the proposal struct in the startExecute and execute functions, which could lead to inconsistent states.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the proposal struct and other variables, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of data.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a large amount of gas to execute if the condition checking the balance of the contract is high, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract without proper checks for potential integer overflow/underflow issues.
5) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks for a condition related to the balance of the contract, which may not accurately represent the desired business logic for execution.
