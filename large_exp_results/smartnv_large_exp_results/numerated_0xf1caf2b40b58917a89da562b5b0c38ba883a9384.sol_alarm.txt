The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any proper validation or synchronization mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables `WETH`, `USDC`, `pair`, `debt`, and `collateral` is set to public, which can pose a security risk if sensitive information is exposed unintentionally.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `calculatePrice` does not specify the gas amount required for execution, which can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
