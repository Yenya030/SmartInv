The identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not check for any internal state changes that could affect this value, potentially leading to an inconsistent state update.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is marked as internal, which may cause issues related to ownership and access control within the contract. 

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates and incorrect visibility/ownership.
