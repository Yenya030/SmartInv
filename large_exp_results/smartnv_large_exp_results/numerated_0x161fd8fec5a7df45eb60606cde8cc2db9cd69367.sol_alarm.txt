Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

- Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute" updates the state variable "proposal" without checking if it's already been initialized or in use, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: The function "endExecute" checks the balance of the contract against the total supply of the token, which may consume a significant amount of gas and result in out-of-gas errors, especially if the token contract has a large number of holders.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but doesn't define the required functions, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues when interacting with other contracts that expect those functions to be present.

Output: inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership.
