The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of underflow in the totalTokens subtraction operation if an excessive amount of tokens is bought.
2) inconsistent state update: The totalTokens variable is directly modified without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to potential issues with the contract's state.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which could potentially expose sensitive information and ownership control to external parties.
