The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not reset the proposal variables after the execution is completed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in future transactions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to potential accessibility by unauthorized parties.
