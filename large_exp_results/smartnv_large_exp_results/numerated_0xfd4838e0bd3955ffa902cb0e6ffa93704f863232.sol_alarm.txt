The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function calculatePrice updates the state of the contract by querying the balance of USDC and WETH from the Uniswap pair contract. This update could be inconsistent if the token balances change during the function execution.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow/underflow in the liquidate function where the calculation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) could result in an overflow or underflow if the values are not properly validated.

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update and integer overflow/underflow.
