The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any proper validation or checks, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable and the `votingToken` variable are not specified with any visibility modifiers (e.g., private, public, internal). This lack of visibility specification can lead to potential issues with ownership and access control.

3) Insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice` function uses the `payable` modifier but does not perform any specific operations related to accepting Ether. This could lead to issues with gas estimation and potentially waste gas.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
