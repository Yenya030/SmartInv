The contract you provided is susceptible to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Arithmetic flaw: The `calculatePrice` function may encounter an arithmetic flaw if the balance of USDC or WETH tokens in the Uniswap pair contract is zero, which could lead to division by zero errors or unexpected behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The `liquidate` function may run out of gas if the debt or collateral amounts are too large, causing the transaction to revert before completion.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are arithmetic flaw and insufficient gas.
