Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that the proposal ID is unique, which could potentially lead to conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execution function allows for updating the votedAmount of a proposal without proper checks or restrictions, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which may not provide the desired level of visibility or ownership control within the contract.
