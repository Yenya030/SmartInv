Contract:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    uint public price;
    
    bool public buyerPaid;
    bool public sellerPaid;
    
    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, uint _price) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        price = _price;
        buyerPaid = false;
        sellerPaid = false;
    }
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit funds");
        require(!buyerPaid, "Buyer has already paid");
        
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect amount deposited");
        
        buyerPaid = true;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can withdraw funds");
        require(buyerPaid, "Buyer has not paid yet");
        require(!sellerPaid, "Seller has already withdrawn funds");
        
        seller.transfer(price);
        sellerPaid = true;
    }
}

Output:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
- inconsistent state update
