The contract provided is as follows:

```
contract Marketplace {
      IERC20 public token;
      address public owner;
      mapping(address => uint) public balances;

      function deposit(uint amount) public {
          token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
          balances[msg.sender] += amount;
      }

      function withdraw(uint amount) public {
          require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
          balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
          token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
      }

      function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set new owner");
          owner = newOwner;
      }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `setOwner` function allows anyone to set a new owner for the contract, which should ideally only be allowed for the current owner to prevent unauthorized changes in ownership.

2) Insufficient gas: If the `withdraw` function requires a significant amount of gas to process, it could lead to a scenario where users are unable to withdraw their funds due to insufficient gas. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership and Insufficient gas.
