Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct, but there is no check to ensure that the same proposal can be executed multiple times, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is defined as internal, which may not provide the intended visibility or control over ownership in the contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
