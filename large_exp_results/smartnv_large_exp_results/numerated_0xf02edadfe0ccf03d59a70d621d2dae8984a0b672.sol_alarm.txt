The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which can make it accessible by other contracts in the same inheritance hierarchy, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the number of voters is too large, as it calculates the balance of each voter twice in the `require` statement.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal directly, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could lead to confusion or mix-up in the execution process.
