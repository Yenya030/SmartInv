The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Atomicity violation: The contract allows for multiple state changes in separate functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) without proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity of these changes.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `proposal` struct but does not update the `votedAmount` in the `votedProposal` function, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, which could lead to issues related to contract ownership and accessibility.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
