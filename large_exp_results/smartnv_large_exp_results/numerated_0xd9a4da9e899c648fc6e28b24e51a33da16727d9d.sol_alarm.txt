Contract:

contract TokenSale {
  address public tokenAddress;
  address public owner;
  uint public tokenPrice;
  uint public totalTokens;
  mapping(address => uint) public tokensBought;

  constructor(address _tokenAddress, uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) {
    tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
    owner = msg.sender;
    tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    totalTokens = _totalTokens;
  }

  function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
    require(msg.value == _numTokens * tokenPrice, "Incorrect value sent for tokens");
    require(tokensBought[msg.sender] + _numTokens <= totalTokens, "Exceeds total tokens available");
    tokensBought[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
    // transfer tokens to buyer address
  }

  function withdraw(address _to, uint _amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
    require(address(this).balance >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
    payable(_to).transfer(_amount);
  }
}

Output:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not verify if the buyer has enough balance before updating their token balance.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access if not properly managed.
3) Insufficient gas: Transferring funds in the `withdraw` function could potentially run out of gas if the contract's balance is too low.
