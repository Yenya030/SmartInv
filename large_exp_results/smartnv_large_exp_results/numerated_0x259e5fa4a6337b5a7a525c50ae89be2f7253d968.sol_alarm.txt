The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to prevent multiple calls that might lead to improper updating of the variable.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility, potentially leading to access control issues.
