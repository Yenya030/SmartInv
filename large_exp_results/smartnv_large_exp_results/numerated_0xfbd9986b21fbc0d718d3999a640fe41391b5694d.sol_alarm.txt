The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function, but the state update for this variable is not used consistently throughout the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may affect the intended visibility and ownership structure of the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function performs a gas-intensive operation by checking the balance of the contract and the total supply of the token, which may lead to insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
