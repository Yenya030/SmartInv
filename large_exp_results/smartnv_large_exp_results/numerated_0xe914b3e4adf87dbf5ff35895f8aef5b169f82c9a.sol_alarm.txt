The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal by incrementing the votedAmount without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds is not specified, which can lead to potential visibility issues and ownership concerns in the contract.
