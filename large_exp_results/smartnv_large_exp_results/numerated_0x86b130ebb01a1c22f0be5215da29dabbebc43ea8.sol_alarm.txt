This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility: The functions `votingToken.transferFrom`, `votedProposal`, `lockedFunds`, `getStartingBalance`, and `getPrice` should consider their visibility for security reasons. 
- Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may run out of gas if the gas limit is too low, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is directly modified in the `execute` function without proper validation, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
