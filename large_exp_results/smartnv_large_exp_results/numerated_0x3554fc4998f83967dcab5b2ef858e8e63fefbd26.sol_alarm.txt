The contract you provided:
contract VestingContract {
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public startTime;
    uint public duration;
    uint public totalAmount;
    uint public amountWithdrawn;

    constructor(address _beneficiary, uint _duration, uint _totalAmount) public {
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        startTime = block.timestamp;
        duration = _duration;
        totalAmount = _totalAmount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Only beneficiary can withdraw");
        require(block.timestamp >= startTime + duration, "Vesting period not over yet");

        uint amount = (totalAmount * (block.timestamp - startTime) / duration) - amountWithdrawn;
        amountWithdrawn += amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
3) business logic flaw
5) atomicity violation
6) cross bridge inconsistency
