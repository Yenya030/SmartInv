Contract you are analyzing:

contract SimpleToken {
         uint public totalSupply;
         mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;

         function mint(address account, uint amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can mint");
             require(totalSupply + amount >= totalSupply, "integer overflow");
             totalSupply += amount;
             balanceOf[account] += amount;
         }
         function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
             require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "insufficient balance");
             balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
             balanceOf[to] += amount;
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
9) integer overflow/underflow
14) incorrect visibility/ownership
