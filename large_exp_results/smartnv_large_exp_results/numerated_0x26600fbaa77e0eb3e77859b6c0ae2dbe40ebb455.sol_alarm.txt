This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have a mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals or other entities, which could lead to potential conflicts or unexpected behavior.

2) Ether leakage: There is a lack of proper handling of Ether transactions within the contract, which may result in unintended Ether leakage or loss.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables within the contract may not be appropriately set, leading to potential security risks or unauthorized access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, ether leakage, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
