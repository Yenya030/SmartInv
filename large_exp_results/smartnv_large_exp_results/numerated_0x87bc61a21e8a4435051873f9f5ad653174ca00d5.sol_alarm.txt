The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseAmount and refundAmount functions do not restrict access to only the arbiter, allowing potential unauthorized access to fund release or refund.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of synchronization between buyerApproved and sellerApproved variables, leading to potential inconsistencies in the approval status of parties. This may result in improper fund releases.
3) Suicidal contracts: There is no functionality to prevent the contract from self-destructing, posing a risk of potential loss of funds if the contract is destructed intentionally or unintentionally.
