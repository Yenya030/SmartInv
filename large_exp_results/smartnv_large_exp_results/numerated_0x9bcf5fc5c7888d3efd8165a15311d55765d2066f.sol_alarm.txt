The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of the variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, and `startingBalanceList` is not specified, making them potentially susceptible to external manipulation.
2) Lack of access control: The contract does not implement access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users, which can lead to privilege escalation.
3) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `proposal.votedAmount` are updated separately without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the size of the transactions, there might be insufficient gas provided, leading to the functions failing midway.
5) Possible ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions, leaving room for potential ether leakage if the contract receives ether unintentionally.
6) Arithmetic flaw: The division operation in the `liquidate` function can result in unexpected results due to potential integer overflow/underflow issues.
