Contract to be analyzed:

contract Insurance {
     struct Policy {
          address insured;
          uint256 coverageAmount;
          bool paidOut;
          uint256 premium;
          }
     mapping(address => Policy) public policies;
     address public owner;

     function createPolicy(address _insured, uint256 _coverageAmount, uint256 _premium) public {
           require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can create policy");
           policies[_insured] = Policy(_insured, _coverageAmount, false, _premium);
     }

     function claimInsurance(address _insured) public {
           require(policies[_insured].insured == _insured, "policy does not exist");
           require(!policies[_insured].paidOut, "insurance already paid out");
           require(msg.sender == policies[_insured].insured, "only insured can claim insurance");
           // process insurance claim and payout
           policies[_insured].paidOut = true;
     }

     function cancelPolicy(address _insured) public {
           require(policies[_insured].insured == _insured, "policy does not exist");
           require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == policies[_insured].insured, "not authorized");
           // refund premium and remove policy
           delete policies[_insured];
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Privilege escalation
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
4) Reentrancy
