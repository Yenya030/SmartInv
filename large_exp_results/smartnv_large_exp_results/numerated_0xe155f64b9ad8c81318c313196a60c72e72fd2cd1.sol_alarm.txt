The contract you provided seems to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of certain variables and functions, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data state.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas in certain functions, which could prevent the functions from executing properly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
