The contract being analyzed:

contract TokenSwap {
         IERC20 public tokenA;
         IERC20 public tokenB;
         
         function swapTokens(uint amount) public {
             require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
             tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
             tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `tokenB.transfer` function allows anyone to call it, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers.
- Insufficient gas: The `swapTokens` function does not include any gas stipend for token transfers, which could result in failed transactions due to running out of gas.
