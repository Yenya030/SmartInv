Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Reentrancy: The contract does not have any checks to prevent reentrancy attacks, where an external entity can call the contract repeatedly before the previous calls are completed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limits explicitly, which may result in transactions failing if they require more gas than the default limit, risking potential denial-of-service attacks.

3) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data state or unexpected behavior.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not properly define the visibility of some functions or properties, potentially exposing unintended access or manipulation by external entities.

5) Business logic flaw: The execution of proposals and endExecute functions may contain logical flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the voting process or gain unauthorized access to funds.

6) Atomicity violation: The contract lacks mechanisms to ensure atomicity of operations, which may result in partial execution of functions and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

7) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure the uniqueness of identifiers used in the contract, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior when handling proposals or other data structures.
