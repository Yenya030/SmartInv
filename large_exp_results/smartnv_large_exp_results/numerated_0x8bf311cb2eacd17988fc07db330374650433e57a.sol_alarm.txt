The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract could be:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is used in the setExchangeRate function but it is not defined in the contract, which can lead to ownership vulnerabilities.
- arithmetic flaw: In the exchangeToken function, the calculation for amountB (amountA * exchangeRate) can potentially lead to arithmetic flaws such as integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.
