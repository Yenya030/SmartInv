Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() update the state of the proposal struct without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function checks the balance of the contract against the total supply of the token without considering potential gas limitations, which could result in insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to visibility issues or ownership concerns if not properly managed.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
