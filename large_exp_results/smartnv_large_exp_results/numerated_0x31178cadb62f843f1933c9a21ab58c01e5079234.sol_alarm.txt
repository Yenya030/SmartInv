Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'startExecute' function does not properly initialize the 'startingBalanceList' mapping before updating it, which could lead to an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level based on the context of the contract.
