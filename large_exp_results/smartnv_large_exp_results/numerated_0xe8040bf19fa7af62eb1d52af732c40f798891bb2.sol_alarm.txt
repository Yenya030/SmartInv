The contract in question potentially contains the following vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that the `proposal.sTime` and `proposal.votedAmount` conditions are also met.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas limit is insufficient to complete the necessary token transfers and balance checks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
