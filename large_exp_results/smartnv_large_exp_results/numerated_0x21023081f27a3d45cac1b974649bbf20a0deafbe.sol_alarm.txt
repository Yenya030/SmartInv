The contract you provided seems to have some potential vulnerabilities:

1) Insufficient gas - The functions in the contract may require more gas than the default gas limit, leading to transactions failing.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - It's not clear if the owner variable should be public or if ownership should be managed through access control mechanisms for better security.

Therefore, potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

- insufficient gas
- incorrect visibility/ownership
