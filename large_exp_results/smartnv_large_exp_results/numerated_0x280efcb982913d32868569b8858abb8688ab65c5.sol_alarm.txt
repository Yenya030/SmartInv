Contract:
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    mapping(address => uint) public voteCounts;
    
    function vote(bool inFavor) public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        if (inFavor) {
            voteCounts[msg.sender]++;
        } else {
            voteCounts[msg.sender]--;
        }
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
    
    function getVoteCount(address user) public view returns(uint) {
        return voteCounts[user];
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
7) ID uniqueness violation: There is a possibility that a user can manipulate the vote by voting multiple times from the same address.
10) Arithmetic flaw: The voting system does not have validation to ensure that the vote count does not go below zero, leading to the risk of negative vote counts.
