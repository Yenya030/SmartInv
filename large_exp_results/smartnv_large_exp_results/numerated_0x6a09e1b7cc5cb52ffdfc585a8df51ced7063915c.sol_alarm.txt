Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation bug in the startExecute function, where anyone can start a new proposal without proper authorization. 
- Inconsistent state update vulnerability as the startingBlance variable is not being updated correctly in the startExecute function. 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership issue as the owner variable is internal, which may not provide the desired access control.
