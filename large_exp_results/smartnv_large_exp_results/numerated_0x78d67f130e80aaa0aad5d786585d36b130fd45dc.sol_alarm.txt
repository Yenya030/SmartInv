The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'endExecute' function updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates when accessed concurrently by multiple users.
   
2) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function requires transferring tokens which could potentially consume a large amount of gas, leading to out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions are not explicitly defined, potentially leading to unexpected access or manipulation by unauthorized parties.
