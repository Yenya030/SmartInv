Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized users from calling functions that should only be accessed by specific privileged users.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated across different functions without proper synchronization, which could result in inconsistent or unexpected states.
3) Insufficient gas: The gas consumption of the functions is not optimized, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors or failed transactions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, and the visibility of certain functions may not be accurately set, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
