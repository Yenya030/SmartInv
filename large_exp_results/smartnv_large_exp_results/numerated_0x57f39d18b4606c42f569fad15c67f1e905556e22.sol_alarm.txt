The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if a proposal is already ongoing, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: There is a potential for running out of gas in the endExecute() function, as it checks the balance of the contract against the total supply without specifying a gas limit.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is defined as internal, which may not restrict access as intended.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
