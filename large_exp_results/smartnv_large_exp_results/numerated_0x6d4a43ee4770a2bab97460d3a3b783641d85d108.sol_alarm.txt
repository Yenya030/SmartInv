The contract you provided might have potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract's token holdings, but it does not consider the possibility of reentrancy attacks or external calls that could change the state before the operation is completed.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface, which implies certain function signatures and access levels, but it does not explicitly define the visibility or access control modifiers for these functions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
