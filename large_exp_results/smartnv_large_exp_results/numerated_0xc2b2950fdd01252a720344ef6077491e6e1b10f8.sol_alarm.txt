Contract you are going to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    mapping(address => uint256) public voteCounts;
    
    function vote(bool inSupport) public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        
        if (inSupport) {
            voteCounts[msg.sender] += 1;
        } else {
            voteCounts[msg.sender] -= 1;
        }
        
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
}
Output: Incorrect visibility/ownership
