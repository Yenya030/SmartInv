Vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation - There is no clear mechanism ensuring the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to potential conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update - The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state without properly handling potential reentrancy issues.
3) Atomicity violation - The `execute` function involves multiple state changes (transfer and addition), which could be susceptible to race conditions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of functions and variables, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation.
