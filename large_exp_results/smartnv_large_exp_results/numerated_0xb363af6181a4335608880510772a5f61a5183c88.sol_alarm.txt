Contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid vote amount");
        votes[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalVotes += amount;
    }

    function revokeVote(uint amount) public {
        require(votes[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough votes to revoke");
        votes[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalVotes -= amount;
    }
}

Output: 
- insufficient gas
- integer overflow/underflow
