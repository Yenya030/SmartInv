The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The `votingToken`, `startingBalanceList`, `proposal`, `lockedFunds` variables are not specified with visibility keywords (e.g., public, internal, private).
  
2) Inconsistent state update:
- In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` variable is incremented directly using `+=` without using a locking mechanism, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are processed simultaneously.

3) Privilege escalation:
- It is unclear if the access control mechanisms are properly implemented to prevent unauthorized access and operations within the contract.

4) Atomicity violation:
- The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped within a single transaction, leaving potential vulnerabilities if an operation fails midway through.

5) Ether leakage:
- The contract does not handle Ether transactions, which could potentially lead to unintended loss of Ether if sent to the contract address.

6) Insufficient gas:
- The contract does not specify gas limits, which could lead to out-of-gas errors during contract execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, atomicity violation, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
