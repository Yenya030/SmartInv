The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
-  Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, which may not accurately represent the funds that should be locked.
-  Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` implements the interface `IERC20` but does not define all the required functions, which may lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect a full implementation of `IERC20`.
