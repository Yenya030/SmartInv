The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure ID uniqueness for proposals or other entities, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to unnecessary external access and manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limits set for transactions, certain operations within the contract may fail due to insufficient gas provided.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
