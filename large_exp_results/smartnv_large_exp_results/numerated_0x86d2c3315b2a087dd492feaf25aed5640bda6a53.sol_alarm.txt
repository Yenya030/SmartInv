Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if the proposal is ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal` struct without properly checking if the execution has ended or if the voting has gone through, which can lead to incorrect state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions, such as `endExecute`, due to complex operations and interactions with external contracts.
