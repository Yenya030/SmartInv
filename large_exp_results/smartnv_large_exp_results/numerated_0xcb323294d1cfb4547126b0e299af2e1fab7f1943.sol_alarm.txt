The contract provided for analysis:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 
        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 
        }

    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" variable is being accessed directly in functions without specifying its visibility, which can lead to potential issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the startExecute function, there is a typo in the variable name "startingBlance", which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Business logic flaw: The execution of proposals is based on time checks and voting conditions, which might have flaws in the overall business logic flow.
4) Insufficient gas: If the contract has complex logic or heavy computation, there might be a risk of running out of gas during execution, leading to failures.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
3) business logic flaw
4) insufficient gas
