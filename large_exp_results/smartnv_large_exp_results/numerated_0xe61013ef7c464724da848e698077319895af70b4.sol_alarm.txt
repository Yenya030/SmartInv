The contract provided for analysis:
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
     }
     address internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBalance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling certain functions that should only be accessed by privileged entities.
2) Business logic flaw: There might be potential flaws in the business logic that can be exploited to achieve unintended behavior or outcomes.
3) Inconsistent state update: There could be scenarios where the state of the contract is updated inconsistently, leading to unexpected results or vulnerabilities.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: There might be issues related to the visibility or ownership of certain functions or variables within the contract that can be exploited by attackers.
