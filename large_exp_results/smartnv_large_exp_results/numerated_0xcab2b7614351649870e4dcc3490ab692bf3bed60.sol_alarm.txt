The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    mapping(address => uint) public voteCount;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        voteCount[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function getTotalVotes() public view returns (uint) {
        return totalVotes;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses the sender's address as a unique identifier for tracking whether they have voted or not. However, this approach may not guarantee uniqueness, leading to potential issues if multiple users share the same address.

Therefore, the potential vulnerability in the contract is an ID uniqueness violation.
