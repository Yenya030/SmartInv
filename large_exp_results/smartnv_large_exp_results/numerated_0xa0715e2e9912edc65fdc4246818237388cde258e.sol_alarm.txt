Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security risks.
2) Privilege escalation: The function startExecute allows any address to initialize a new proposal without proper authorization, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
3) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the votedAmount without proper synchronization or validation, leading to inconsistent state updates.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow, such as in the liquidate function of the ExchangeTokens contract.

Overall, there are vulnerabilities present in the contract that need to be addressed to ensure its security and stability.
