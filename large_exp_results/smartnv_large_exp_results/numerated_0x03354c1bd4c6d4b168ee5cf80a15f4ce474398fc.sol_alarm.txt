Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without restricting access or ensuring proper synchronization.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in `execute()`, but it is not shown in the contract. It could potentially have incorrect visibility or ownership, exposing vulnerabilities.
