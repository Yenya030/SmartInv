Vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring that it accurately reflects the actual balance of funds locked in the contract, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the necessary functions to comply with the interface, which can lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that rely on the interface.
