Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function, but it is not defined or implemented in the contract. This could lead to inconsistent state updates or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, but it is used in the `execute` function which is external. This might lead to issues related to visibility and ownership within the contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
