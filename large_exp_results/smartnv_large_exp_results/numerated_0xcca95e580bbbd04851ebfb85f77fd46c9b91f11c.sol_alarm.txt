Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is not defined in the contract, so the `resetVotes` function will fail as it references an undefined `owner`.
- Insufficient gas: The `vote` function does not have any limit on gas consumption, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for duplicate addresses when voting, which could lead to multiple votes from the same address.
- Business logic flaw: There is a potential logical flaw in the `vote` function where voters can change their delegate multiple times, leading to potential manipulation of the voting system.
