The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
- In the function `endExecute()`, the operation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` can potentially result in an integer overflow if the balance of the token is very large.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The `Proposal` struct is not specified with any access control modifiers, potentially allowing unauthorized access and modification from external contracts. 

Please note that the contract is healthy if it does not contain any vulnerabilities from the list provided.
