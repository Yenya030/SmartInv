Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in tracking proposals.

13) Insufficient gas: The contract does not incorporate gas optimization techniques, which could result in failed transactions due to running out of gas.

14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility settings of certain functions and variables are not explicitly specified, which may introduce confusion or unintended access control issues.
