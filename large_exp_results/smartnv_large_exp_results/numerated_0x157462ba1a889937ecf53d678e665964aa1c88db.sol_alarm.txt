The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable based on a condition that might not accurately reflect the state of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables WETH, USDC, and pair in the ExchangeTokens contract are declared as public, which may expose sensitive information or functionality to unauthorized parties.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the liquidate() function which involves multiplication and division (`getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`) could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Integer overflow/underflow.
