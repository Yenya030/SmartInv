Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables (proposal, startingBalanceList) in the startExecute function without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail to execute if there is not enough gas provided, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is defined as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for this variable. Proper access control mechanisms should be implemented to ensure only authorized users can modify critical state variables.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals with the same ID are processed simultaneously.

5) Business logic flaw: The execution logic in the endExecute function may have unintended consequences, such as locking funds indefinitely if certain conditions are not met, leading to a potential loss of funds.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, opening up the possibility for unintended ether transfers or losses if Ether is mistakenly sent to the contract address.
