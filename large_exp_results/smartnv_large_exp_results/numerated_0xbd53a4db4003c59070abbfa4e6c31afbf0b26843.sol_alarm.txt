The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Insufficient gas: There are multiple functions that involve token transfers which could potentially run out of gas if the contract balance is low.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is set to internal, which may not be intended and could lead to ownership control issues.

3) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the lockedFunds is more than half of the total supply to determine if execution failed, which may not be an accurate or secure metric for determining success or failure.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
