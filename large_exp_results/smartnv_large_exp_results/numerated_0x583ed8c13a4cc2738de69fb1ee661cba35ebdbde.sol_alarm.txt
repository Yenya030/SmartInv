Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The subscriptions[user] variable is directly updated in the subscribe and cancelSubscription functions without proper validation or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent data states.
2) Integer underflow: The cancelSubscription function does not check for integer underflow when subtracting the amount from the subscriptions[user] value, which could result in a negative value if the amount to cancel is greater than the existing subscription balance.
