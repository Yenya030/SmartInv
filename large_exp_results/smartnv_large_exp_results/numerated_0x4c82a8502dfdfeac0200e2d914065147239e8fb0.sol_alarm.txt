This is the contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public recipient;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;
    bool public payerApproved;
    bool public recipientApproved;
    
    constructor(address _payer, address _recipient, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
        payer = _payer;
        recipient = _recipient;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = _amount;
    }
    
    function approvePayment() public {
        require(msg.sender == payer || msg.sender == recipient, "Only payer or recipient can approve payment");
        if(msg.sender == payer) {
            payerApproved = true;
        } else {
            recipientApproved = true;
        }
    }
    
    function finalize() public {
        require(payerApproved && recipientApproved, "Both parties need to approve before finalizing");
        payable(recipient).transfer(amount);
    }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership (payer, recipient, arbiter, amount should ideally be private)
- privilege escalation (anyone can call approvePayment without proper restrictions)
- inconsistent state update (payerApproved and recipientApproved can be manipulated separately)
- atomicity violation (finalization does not check if both approvals are done simultaneously)
