Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the state consistently in functions such as `execute` and `endExecute`, where the `votedAmount` and `lockedFunds` are updated without proper synchronization or validation.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility and could lead to issues with ownership control.

3) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the `execute` function where multiple state changes occur without being wrapped in a single transaction, leaving room for potential reentrancy attacks.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions or potential Ether transfers securely, which could lead to Ether leakage vulnerabilities.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas requirements for operations like `votingToken.transferFrom` or `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2`, which may result in out-of-gas exceptions and unexpected behavior.

6) Business logic flaw: The conditions and checks in functions like `endExecute` may not accurately reflect the intended business logic, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes.

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce unique IDs for proposals, which could result in conflicts or inconsistencies when multiple proposals are submitted.
