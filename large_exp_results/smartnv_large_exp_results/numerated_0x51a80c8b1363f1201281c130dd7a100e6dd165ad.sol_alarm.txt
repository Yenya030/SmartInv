The contract to analyze:

contract MarketMaker {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _tokenA, address _tokenB) {
        tokenA = IERC20(_tokenA);
        tokenB = IERC20(_tokenB);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function trade(uint amountA, uint amountB) public {
        require(amountA > 0 && amountB > 0, "Invalid amounts");
        
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the MarketMaker contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The trade function does not update the internal state after transferring tokens, which may result in inconsistent state if the transfer fails.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The changeOwner function allows anyone to change the owner of the contract, which is not intended. The ownership should be restricted to the current owner only.
