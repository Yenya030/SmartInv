Contract to analyze: 

contract MultiSigWallet {
    address[] public owners;
    uint public limit;

    function setLimit(uint _limit) public {
        limit = _limit;
    }

    function addOwner(address _owner) public {
        owners.push(_owner);
    }

    function removeOwner(address _owner) public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            if (owners[i] == _owner) {
                delete owners[i];
            }
        }
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(owners.length >= limit, "Not enough owners");
        for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            // perform withdrawal logic
        }
    }
}

Output:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check or enforcement to ensure uniqueness when adding owners, potentially leading to duplicate owners in the list.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of the owners array are public, which may expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
- Inconsistent state update: The removeOwner function deletes an element from the owners array without updating the length or reorganizing the array, potentially resulting in an inconsistent state and unexpected behavior.
- Insufficient gas: The withdraw function iterates over all owners to perform the withdrawal logic, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
- Business logic flaw: The logic for managing owners and their permissions is simplistic and may not provide sufficient security measures for a multi-signature wallet.
