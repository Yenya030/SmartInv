The contract provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `owner` variables are marked as internal, which could lead to incorrect visibility/ownership concerns.
2) inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the same proposal is not being voted on multiple times.
3) insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function uses a gas-intensive operation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could potentially lead to running out of gas.
4) integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the `execute` function when updating `proposal.votedAmount`.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
- inconsistent state update
- insufficient gas
- integer overflow/underflow
