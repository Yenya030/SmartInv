This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of certain functions (e.g., `votedProposal`, `getStartingBalance`, `getPrice`). It is crucial to define the visibility of functions to ensure proper access control.

2) Privilege escalation: The `endExecute` function may allow an unauthorized party to lock up more funds than intended if they can manipulate the conditions to meet the requirement `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`.

3) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, `proposal` is updated without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to execute this function simultaneously.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, privilege escalation, and inconsistent state update.
