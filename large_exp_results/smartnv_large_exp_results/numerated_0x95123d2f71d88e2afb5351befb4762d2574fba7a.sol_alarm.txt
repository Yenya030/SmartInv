The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct is not specified with any visibility (public, private, internal, external) which can lead to unintended access or manipulation of the data.

2) Inconsistent state update: The "votedProposal" function is called without being defined, which can lead to inconsistent state updates or potential issues.

3) Atomicity violation: The logic in the "execute" function does not ensure atomicity of operations, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not account for sufficient gas in certain functions, which can lead to out-of-gas errors and transaction failures.
