The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which means it can be accessed by inheriting contracts, potentially exposing sensitive information.
