The contract in question:

contract TokenSale {
         IERC20 public token;
         address public owner;
         address public admin;
         uint public tokenPrice;

         constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice) public {
            token = _token;
            owner = msg.sender;
            tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
         }

         function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
             require(msg.value == amount * tokenPrice, "Insufficient ether provided");
             token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         }

         function setAdmin(address _admin) public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set admin");
             admin = _admin;
         }

         function withdrawEther() public {
             require(msg.sender == owner || msg.sender == admin, "Only owner/admin can withdraw ether");
             msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
         }
}

Vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable can be set by the `setAdmin` function, which has a visibility of public, allowing anyone to set the admin. This can lead to privilege escalation if an unauthorized user sets themselves as the admin.
2) Ether leakage: The `withdrawEther` function allows both the owner and admin to withdraw Ether from the contract's balance. This can lead to Ether leakage if the owner/admin withdraws Ether unexpectedly or maliciously.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is no mechanism in place to check if the token transfer in the `buyTokens` function was successful or not. If the token transfer fails, the contract state will be inconsistent.
4) Insufficient gas: If the contract's balance is too high, the transfer in the `withdrawEther` function might fail due to insufficient gas as the transfer might consume a significant amount of gas.
5) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have a mechanism to self-destruct, but if implemented in the future, this could lead to the contract accidentally destroying itself.

Overall, the contract could use improvements in terms of ownership control, fail-safe mechanisms for token transfers, and better gas management.
