The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any conditions or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled correctly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is defined as internal, which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns depending on the intended access control design of the contract.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve integers, such as in the `calculatePrice` function. Without proper checks and validations, integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities could arise.

4) Insufficient gas: The `liquidate` function involves multiple token transfers, which could potentially require a significant amount of gas. If not carefully managed, this function may face gas limitation issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Integer overflow/underflow
4) Insufficient gas
