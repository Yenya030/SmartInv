The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without checks or restrictions, which can lead to inconsistencies in the data.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to potential conflicts or errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, internal, external) of the owner variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transfer or Ether-related functions, leaving it vulnerable to Ether leakage or accidental Ether loss.
