Contract you are going to analyze:

contract TokenSwap {
     IERC20 public tokenA;
     IERC20 public tokenB;
    
     function swapTokens(uint amountA, uint amountB) public {
         tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
         tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);
         tokenA.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
         tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountA);
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for the transfer of tokens without properly updating the state variables, which could lead to inconsistencies in the token balances.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables and functions, which could pose security risks related to unauthorized access.
