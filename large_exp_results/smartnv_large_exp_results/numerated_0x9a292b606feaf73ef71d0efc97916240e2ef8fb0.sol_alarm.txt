Contract to analyze:
contract VotingSystem {
     address public admin;
     mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
     uint public totalVotes;

     constructor() {
         admin = msg.sender;
     }

     function vote() public {
         require(hasVoted[msg.sender] == false, "Already voted");
         hasVoted[msg.sender] = true; 
         totalVotes++;
     }

     function resetVotes() public {
         require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can reset votes");
         totalVotes = 0;
         for (uint i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
             hasVoted[msg.sender] = false;
         }
     }
}
   
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The loop in the resetVotes function is not correctly resetting the hasVoted mapping, as it should iterate over the totalVotes variable, not until the totalVotes variable.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to see who the admin is, which may not be desired.
3) Business logic flaw: The resetVotes function does not reset the totalVotes variable after resetting the hasVoted mapping, which could lead to an incorrect count of total votes.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for ensuring that addresses used for voting are unique, potentially allowing the same address to vote multiple times.
