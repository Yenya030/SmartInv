The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) business logic flaw: The `startExecute` function allows for a new proposal to be created without checking if another proposal is already ongoing, potentially leading to multiple proposals running simultaneously.
2) inconsistent state update: In the `endExecute` function, the comparison `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` could lead to inconsistent state updates as it does not properly handle the scaling of balances and total supply for comparison.
3) insufficient gas: If the contract operations consume a large amount of gas, there is a possibility of running out of gas before being able to complete the intended operations.
