The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSale {
     address payable public owner;
     IERC20 public token;
     uint public tokenPrice;
     uint public totalSold;

     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice) public {
         owner = msg.sender;
         token = _token;
         tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _amount) public payable {
         require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Insufficient ETH sent for tokens");
         require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount, "Not enough tokens available");

         token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
         balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
         totalSold += _amount;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
         owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:

1) inconsistent state update
2) atomicity violation
3) ether leakage
