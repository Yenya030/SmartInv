The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are updated in the `liquidate` function without proper reconciliation.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `calculatePrice` function is marked as public but contains a potentially sensitive operation of returning a price calculation. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
