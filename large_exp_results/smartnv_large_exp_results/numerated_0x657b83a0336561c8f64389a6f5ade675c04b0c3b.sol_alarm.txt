Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may lead to incorrect access control.
2) inconsistent state update - There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies.
3) atomicity violation - The `execute` function performs multiple operations that should be atomic, such as transferring tokens and updating the `proposal.votedAmount`.
4) insufficient gas - If the gas limit is not set properly, certain functions like `endExecute` may run out of gas during execution.
5) ID uniqueness violation - The contract does not handle ID uniqueness for proposals, which can lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts.
6) business logic flaw - There may be potential flaws in the business logic of the contract that could lead to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities.
