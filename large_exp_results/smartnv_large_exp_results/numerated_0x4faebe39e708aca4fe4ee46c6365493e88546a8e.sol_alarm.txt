The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not provide any way to retrieve or utilize this information. This could be an inconsistent state update vulnerability.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the function `liquidate()`, there is a potential arithmetic flaw where the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` could lead to unexpected results due to the order of operations or integer division. 

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not specified in the contract whether certain functions should have restricted access (e.g., onlyOwner modifier) or what level of visibility they should have. This lack of clarity could lead to vulnerabilities related to incorrect function visibility or ownership control. 

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure its security and functionality.
