The contract provided for analysis:

contract Bank {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer underflow in the withdraw function if the amount to withdraw is greater than the current balance of the user.

2) Ether leakage: The transfer function in the withdraw method may lead to ether leakage if there are reentrancy attacks or if the transfer fails midway.

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract balance becomes very high due to repeated deposits, there could be a situation where the gas required for the withdrawal exceeds the block gas limit.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the Bank contract are integer overflow/underflow, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
