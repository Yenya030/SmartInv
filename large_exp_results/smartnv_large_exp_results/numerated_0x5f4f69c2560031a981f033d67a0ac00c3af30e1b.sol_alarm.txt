contract TokenSwap {

     uint public exchangeRate;

     function swapTokens(uint amountA) public {
         require(amountA > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
         uint amountB = amountA * exchangeRate;

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

10) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation of amountB in the swapTokens function can potentially lead to arithmetic flaws, such as overflow or underflow, depending on the value of exchangeRate and amountA.

13) Insufficient gas: If the amountB calculated exceeds the gas limit for transferring tokens in the tokenB.transfer function, the transaction may run out of gas and fail.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract are arithmetic flaw and insufficient gas.
