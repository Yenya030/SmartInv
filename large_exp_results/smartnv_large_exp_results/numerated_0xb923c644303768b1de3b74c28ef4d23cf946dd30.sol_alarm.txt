The contract provided for analysis:

```
contract MyContract {
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public totalSupply;

    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        totalSupply += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(totalSupply >= amount, "Insufficient total supply");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        totalSupply -= amount;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The totalSupply variable is being updated directly without considering potential reentrancy or other unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the totalSupply variable is public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties.
3) Insufficient gas: If the token transfer in the `withdraw` function consumes too much gas, it may lead to failure in completing the transaction.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for ensuring uniqueness of deposited amounts or tokens, which could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple deposits or withdrawals are processed simultaneously.
