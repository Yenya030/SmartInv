The contract you presented contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` without considering if it should be a state variable or reset on each execution. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate()` function, there is a calculation involving `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` which might lead to an arithmetic flaw if not handled properly.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables `debt` and `collateral` is public, which might expose sensitive data to outside manipulation. It's better to make them private or internal to maintain data integrity. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Arithmetic flaw, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
