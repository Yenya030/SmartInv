Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal struct without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function checks for a condition that may require a significant amount of gas to execute, which could potentially lead to running out of gas and failing to complete the execution.

3) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling sensitive functions or accessing critical data, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability.
