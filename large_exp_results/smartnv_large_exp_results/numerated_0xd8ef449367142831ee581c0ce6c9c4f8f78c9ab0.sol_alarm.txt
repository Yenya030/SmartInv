There are potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function `startExecute()` updates the `startingBalanceList` mapping without proper initialization or clearing of previous values.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may lead to issues related to ownership and access control. 

3) ID uniqueness violation: 
   - The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function based on the balance of the contract, which may lead to issues with uniqueness violation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- ID uniqueness violation
