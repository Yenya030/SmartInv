Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `lockedFunds` variables are not specified with any visibility keyword, making them publicly accessible. This could lead to unauthorized access or modification of these variables by external contracts.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the same proposal is not executed multiple times, leading to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if there are a large number of token holders or a significant amount of funds locked, as the check `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` involves multiple storage reads and arithmetic operations.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, potentially allowing for multiple proposals to share the same timestamp and voter address, leading to confusion or errors in proposal execution.
5) Business logic flaw: The requirements and conditions in the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions need to be carefully reviewed to ensure the intended logic is correctly implemented and no unexpected behaviors can occur.

Overall, this contract may have vulnerabilities related to visibility, consistency, gas usage, identifier uniqueness, and business logic.
