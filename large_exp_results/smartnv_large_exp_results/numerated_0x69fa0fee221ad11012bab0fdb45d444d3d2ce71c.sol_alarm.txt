Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable proposal before setting the startingBalanceList for the proposal address. This sequence could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define required functions like transfer and balanceOf. This could lead to incorrect visibility of functions or ownership issues.
