The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute can leave the contract in an inconsistent state if the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" does not hold true.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the struct Proposal, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract performs complex operations or transfers a large amount of tokens, there may be a risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
