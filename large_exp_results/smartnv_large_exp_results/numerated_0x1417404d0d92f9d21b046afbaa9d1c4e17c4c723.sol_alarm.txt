The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract's calculatingPrice function might be susceptible to an integer overflow if the balance of USDC or WETH exceeds the maximum limit of uint256.

2) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function might have a flaw in the business logic as it does not properly handle the situation where the price calculation results in a value that can lead to liquidation inaccuracies. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow and a business logic flaw.
