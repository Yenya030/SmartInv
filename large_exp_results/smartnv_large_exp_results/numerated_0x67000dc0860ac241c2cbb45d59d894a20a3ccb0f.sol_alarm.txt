The contract provided is: 

contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint256) public votes;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint256 amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid vote amount");
        votes[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
        admin = newAdmin;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- privilege escalation in the changeAdmin function
- incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability in the admin variable
- ID uniqueness violation in the votes mapping, as it could potentially be manipulated or duplicated by multiple users.
