The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering other parts of the contract or system state. This can lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The `endExecute` function updates multiple state variables (`proposal.sTime` and `lockedFunds`) without using atomic operations, which can lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute completely if it runs out of gas during the execution due to the potentially high cost of checking the condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Atomicity violation
- Insufficient gas
