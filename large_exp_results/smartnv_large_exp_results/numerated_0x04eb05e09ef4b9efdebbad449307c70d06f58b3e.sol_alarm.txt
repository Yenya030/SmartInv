The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the execute and endExecute functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require more gas than available in a single transaction, leading to potential failure in execution.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions in the contract is not specified properly, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionalities to external users.
