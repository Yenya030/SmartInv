The contract provided for analysis:

contract MultiSigWallet {
    address[] public owners;
    uint public transactionCount;
    mapping(uint => Transaction) public transactions;
    
    struct Transaction {
        address from;
        address to;
        uint amount;
        bool approved;
        mapping(address => bool) approvals;
    }
    
    function createTransaction(address _to, uint _amount) public {
        require(_to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        
        transactions[transactionCount] = Transaction(msg.sender, _to, _amount, false);
        transactionCount++;
    }
    
    function approveTransaction(uint _transactionId) public {
        require(_transactionId < transactionCount, "Invalid transaction ID");
        Transaction storage transaction = transactions[_transactionId];
        require(msg.sender != transaction.from, "Transaction creator cannot approve");
        require(!transaction.approvals[msg.sender], "Transaction already approved by sender");
        
        transaction.approvals[msg.sender] = true;
    }
    
    function executeTransaction(uint _transactionId) public {
        require(_transactionId < transactionCount, "Invalid transaction ID");
        Transaction storage transaction = transactions[_transactionId];
        require(!transaction.approved, "Transaction already approved");
        
        uint approvalsCount;
        for (uint i=0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            if(transaction.approvals[owners[i]]) {
                approvalsCount++;
            }
        }
        
        if(approvalsCount >= owners.length/2) {
            payable(transaction.to).transfer(transaction.amount);
            transaction.approved = true;
        }
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect ownership as the contract does not have a proper mechanism for handling ownership of the contract.
2) Lack of input validation for the transfer amount.
3) Lack of proper access control in the approveTransaction function.
4) Lack of check for integer overflow in the executeTransaction function.
5) Lack of proper handling of reentrancy in the executeTransaction function.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- incorrect ownership
- lack of input validation
- lack of access control
- integer overflow
- reentrancy.
