Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any ownership or access control mechanisms, leaving the functions open to be called by anyone.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, there is no check to ensure that the transfer of tokens and the update of votedAmount are executed atomically, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function could potentially run out of gas if the calculation for lockedFunds requires a lot of gas, leading to the function not completing successfully.
