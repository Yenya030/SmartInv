Contract to analyze:
contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public recipient;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;
    bool public paid;

    constructor(address _payer, address _recipient, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
        payer = _payer;
        recipient = _recipient;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = _amount;
        paid = false;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can deposit funds");
        require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect deposit amount");
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
        require(!paid, "Funds already released");
        payable(recipient).transfer(amount);
        paid = true;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund funds");
        require(!paid, "Funds already released");
        payable(payer).transfer(amount);
        paid = true;
    }
}

Output:
potential vulnerabilities: 14) incorrect visibility/ownership
