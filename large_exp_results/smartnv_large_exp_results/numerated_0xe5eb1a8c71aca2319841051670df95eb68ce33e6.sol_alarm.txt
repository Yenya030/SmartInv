The contract shown below might have the following potential vulnerabilities:

<\contract_to_be_analyzed\>
contract Auction {
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;
    
    function placeBid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Bid amount must be greater than zero");
        
        bids[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
    
    function withdrawBid() public {
        uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No previous bid found");
        
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
<\contract_to_be_analyzed\>

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract might be vulnerable to integer overflow/underflow if the bid amounts exceed the maximum or minimum values that can be stored in a uint data type.
2) Insufficient gas: If the withdrawal process requires more gas than available in a single transaction, the withdrawal might fail and the funds could get stuck.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Depending on the intended functionality, the visibility of certain variables or functions might need to be adjusted for security purposes.
