The contract in question may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The "endExecute" function may have a business logic flaw as it checks the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" for ending execution, which may not accurately reflect the intended logic of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "votingToken" variable is not specified, which may lead to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities in the contract's ownership and access control.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Business logic flaw and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
