The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have issues with the state not being consistently updated in the "execute" function due to the += operator being used on "proposal.votedAmount".

2) Insufficient gas: There may be a potential vulnerability related to insufficient gas in the "endExecute" function where the gas cost of executing the function might not be enough for the required operations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "votingToken" variable is not specified, which could lead to potential issues related to its accessibility and ownership.
