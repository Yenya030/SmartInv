Potential vulnerabilities in the contract for analysis:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the `proposal.votedAmount` directly in the `execute` function without using safe arithmetic operations, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not declared public or internal, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modification.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas limit is reached due to the potential high gas cost of the `require` statement checking for the execution to fail.
4) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing any address to call the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation issues.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract uses basic arithmetic operations without checking for potential integer overflow or underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
