Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract transfers funds before updating the debt and collateral mappings, which may lead to inconsistent state if the transfer fails after the mapping updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs division without handling potential division by zero errors, which can result in arithmetic flaws.
