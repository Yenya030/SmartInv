Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The execute function relies on a state variable (proposal.votedAmount) to check if voting has gone through, but the state update in this function (proposal.votedAmount += amount) is not atomic, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Atomicity violation: The execute function performs multiple operations (transferFrom and updating proposal.votedAmount) without using proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state updates.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not used or updated in the contract, potentially leading to issues related to visibility and ownership control.
