- Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions attempt to modify it simultaneously.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is used without any access control, which may result in unauthorized access or modification of proposal data by external entities.
- Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas to complete the transfer and update operations, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors if the gas limit is insufficient.
