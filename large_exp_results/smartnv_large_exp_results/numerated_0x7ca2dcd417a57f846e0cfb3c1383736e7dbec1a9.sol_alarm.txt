The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSale {
     IERC20 public token;
     address public owner;

     constructor(address _token) {
         token = IERC20(_token);
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint256 amount) public {
         require(msg.value == amount * 2, "Incorrect payment amount");
         token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
     }

     function withdraw() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
         uint balance = address(this).balance;
         msg.sender.transfer(balance);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - The 'constructor' function should be labeled as 'public' visibility to ensure proper contract initialization. 
2) inconsistent state update - The 'withdraw' function allows anyone to call it, potentially resulting in unauthorized fund withdrawals. 
3) improper condition check - the require statement in the 'buyTokens' function might not accurately verify the payment amount.
