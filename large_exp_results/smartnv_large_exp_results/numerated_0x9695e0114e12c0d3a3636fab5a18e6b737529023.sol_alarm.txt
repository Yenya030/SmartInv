Potential vulnerabilities:
- Correct Visibility/Ownership: The functions `releaseFunds` and `refund` can be executed by the `arbiter` without any additional checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- Atomicity Violation: The process of releasing funds or refunding is not done atomically, allowing for potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
- Insufficient Gas: If the contract balance runs out of gas during fund release or refund, it can result in failed transactions, leaving funds in an inconsistent state.
