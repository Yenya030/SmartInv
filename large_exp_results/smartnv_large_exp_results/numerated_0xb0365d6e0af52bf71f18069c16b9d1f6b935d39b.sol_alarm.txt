Contract to be analyzed:
contract PaymentContract {
    uint public totalAmount;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can deposit funds");
        totalAmount += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
        require(totalAmount >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        totalAmount -= amount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentContract:
8) reentrancy
14) incorrect visibility/ownership
