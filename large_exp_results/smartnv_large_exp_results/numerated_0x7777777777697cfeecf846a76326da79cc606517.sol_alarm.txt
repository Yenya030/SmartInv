Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not seem to update the state of the Proposal struct consistently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the internal owner variable is not specified, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to ownership management.
