Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or access control for its functions, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's state.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how this variable is used or managed elsewhere in the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Business logic flaw: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of a proposal without verifying if the `amount` being transferred is valid or authorized, which could lead to unexpected behavior or manipulation of the voting process.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not implement any gas mitigation strategies, which could result in out-of-gas errors during contract execution.

5) Reentrancy: The contract interacts with external contracts using `transferFrom` without implementing the necessary checks to prevent reentrancy attacks.

6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could potentially lead to data corruption or incorrect processing of proposals.

7) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations without checking for potential integer overflows or underflows, which could result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

8) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions or balances, but if ether is sent to the contract accidentally, it could be lost permanently.
