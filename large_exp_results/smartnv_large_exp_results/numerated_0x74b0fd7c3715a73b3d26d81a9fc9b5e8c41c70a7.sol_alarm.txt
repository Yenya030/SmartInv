Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` state variable without using the `proposal` keyword, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined with a proper visibility keyword, which can lead to unexpected behaviors.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function calculates the locked funds based on the balance of the contract, which can lead to insufficient gas error if the balance is too large.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check for potential overflow/underflow in the calculation done in the `liquidate` function.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and integer overflow/underflow.
