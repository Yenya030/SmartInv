The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
In the `TimelockController` contract, the `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without ensuring that the `votedAmount` is correctly reflected in the contract state, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
The `votingToken` variable in the `TimelockController` contract is not explicitly defined with a visibility specifier, which can lead to issues related to contract ownership and visibility.

3) Insufficient gas:
The `endExecute` function in the `TimelockController` contract checks if the total balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply, but this check could require significant gas to execute depending on the token supply and token balance.

4) Business logic flaw:
The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract uses a fixed percentage (80%) to determine if a user's fund can be liquidated, which may not accurately reflect the actual market conditions or risks involved in the liquidation process.
