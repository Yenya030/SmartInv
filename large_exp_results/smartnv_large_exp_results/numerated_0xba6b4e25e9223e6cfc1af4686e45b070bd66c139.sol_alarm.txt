Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not define any of the required functions, which could lead to visibility and ownership issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount field of the proposal struct directly, which might lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function might run out of gas when trying to transfer the lockedFunds to the contract if the gas limit is not set appropriately.
4) Business logic flaw: The endExecute() function calculates the execution failure based on the balance of the contract compared to the total supply, which might not be a valid business logic for the intended functionality.
