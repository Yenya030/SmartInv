Contract to analyze:

contract Purchase {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    uint public price;
    bool public isPaid;

    constructor() {
        buyer = msg.sender;
        seller = address(0x123);
        price = 100;
        isPaid = false;
    }

    function pay() public payable {
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        seller.transfer(msg.value);
        isPaid = true;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can initiate refund");
        require(isPaid, "Payment has not been made yet");
        buyer.transfer(price);
        isPaid = false;
    }
}

Output: 
1) insufficient gas
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
