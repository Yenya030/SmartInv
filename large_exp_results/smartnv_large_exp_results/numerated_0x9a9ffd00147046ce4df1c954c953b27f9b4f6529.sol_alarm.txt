Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly modified in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are used in different functions without specifying their visibility (e.g., `public`, `private`, etc.), which could lead to unexpected behavior or accessibility issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total supply of `votingToken`, but this operation might consume a large amount of gas and result in out-of-gas exceptions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that the `proposal.addr` used in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions are unique, potentially leading to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

5) Ether leakage: There is no indication of handling Ether transactions in the contract, which can result in Ether leakage or misuse.
