The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility modifier for the state variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`. It is important to specify the correct visibility (e.g., `public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`) to control access to these variables.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` line updates the `votedAmount` state variable directly. This can lead to inconsistent states and potential issues if not handled properly.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` which might consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
