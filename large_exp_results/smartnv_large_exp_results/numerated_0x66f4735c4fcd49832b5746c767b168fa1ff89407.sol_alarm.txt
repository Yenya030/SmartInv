Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring the proper conditions are met, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
2) Reentrancy: The `liquidate()` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract does not include checks for reentrancy, which could leave the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
