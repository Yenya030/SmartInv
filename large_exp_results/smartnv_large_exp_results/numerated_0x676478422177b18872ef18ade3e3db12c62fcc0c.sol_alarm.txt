The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, private, internal) for the `votingToken` variable and the `lockedFunds` variable. It is important to clearly define the visibility of variables to control access and prevent unintended modifications.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the `startingBalanceList` variable is updated for `proposal.addr`, but the `proposal` struct does not contain a `startingBalanceList` field. This can lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function transfers tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract address, but it does not specify the gas amount to be used for the transfer. This can result in insufficient gas for the token transfer, causing the transaction to fail.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses `proposal` struct without ensuring uniqueness of proposals. This can potentially lead to conflicts or overwriting of existing proposal data.

5) Reentrancy: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` struct after transferring tokens, which can potentially allow for reentrancy attacks if the `votingToken` contract allows external calls that modify state.

6) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve addition, multiplication, and division. Without proper checks, these operations can result in integer overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected behavior.
