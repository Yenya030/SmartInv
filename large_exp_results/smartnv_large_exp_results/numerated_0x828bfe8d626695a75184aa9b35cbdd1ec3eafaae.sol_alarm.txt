The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The function `liquidate` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract may have a business logic flaw as it calculates the liquidation threshold based on the price obtained from the `getPrice` function, which is not defined in the contract. This may lead to incorrect liquidation decisions.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract is `public`, which may expose sensitive pricing information to anyone on the blockchain. This could potentially lead to front-running or other malicious activities.
