The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The function execute() allows for the transfer of tokens without properly verifying the proposal status, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable without properly checking for conditions, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, certain operations within the contract may run out of gas and fail to complete successfully.
