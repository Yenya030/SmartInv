The contract being analyzed contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract allows the `startExecute` function to be called externally, which sets a new proposal without checking if the caller has the appropriate privilege.

2) inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, it updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal directly, but it does not use safe arithmetic operations to prevent inconsistencies.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, potentially leading to issues with ownership and access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
