Contract to analyze:
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public depositAmount;
    enum State { AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE }
    State public currentState;

    constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter) {
        buyer = msg.sender;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        currentState = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can deposit funds.");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_PAYMENT, "Payment has already been made.");
        depositAmount = msg.value;
    }

    function confirmDelivery() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only buyer, seller, or arbiter can confirm delivery.");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Payment not yet made or confirmation already received.");
        seller.transfer(depositAmount);
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can release funds.");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Payment not yet made or confirmation already received.");
        seller.transfer(depositAmount);
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
    }

    function refundBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can refund the buyer.");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Payment not yet made or confirmation already received.");
        buyer.transfer(depositAmount);
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
    }
} 

Output: 
- The contract contains potential vulnerability of incorrect visibility/ownership, as there are functions that should only be accessible by specific addresses but do not enforce this properly.
- The contract also has a business logic flaw in which the arbiter can perform conflicting actions (releaseFunds and refundBuyer) which could lead to misuse.
- Atomicity violation could occur as certain states change, but multiple functions can interact with these states which could lead to inconsistent behavior.
