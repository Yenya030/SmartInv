Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal and startingBalanceList, but there is a potential inconsistency by not ensuring that the startingBalanceList is updated before the proposal state is updated.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20 but it does not provide the necessary functions defined in the interface. This could lead to issues related to incorrect visibility or ownership.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a large amount of gas if the condition for execution failed is met, which could lead to out of gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
