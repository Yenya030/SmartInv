Contract:
contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            payable(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid); 
        }

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can withdraw");
        uint amount = highestBid;
        highestBid = 0;
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Withdrawal failed");
    }
}

Output: 
Potential vulnerabilities:
6) Cross bridge inconsistency (When transferring funds, bridges are not maintained correctly)
8) Reentrancy (Withdraw function is susceptible to reentrancy attacks)
