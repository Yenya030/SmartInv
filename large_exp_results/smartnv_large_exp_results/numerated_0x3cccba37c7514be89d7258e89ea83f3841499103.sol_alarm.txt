This contract may contain potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables in the `endExecute()` function without proper synchronization or checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not specified with any visibility modifier, making it accessible publicly. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposal data. 

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set, the contract may run out of gas during the execution of certain functions, causing them to fail unexpectedly. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
