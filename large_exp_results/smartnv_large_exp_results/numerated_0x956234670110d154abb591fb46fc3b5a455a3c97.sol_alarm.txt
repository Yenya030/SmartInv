Given the contract you are asking to analyze:

contract NonFungibleToken is IERC721 {
         mapping(uint256 => address) public tokenOwners;
         mapping(address => uint256) public ownedTokensCount;
         uint256 public tokenCount;

         function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
             require(tokenOwners[tokenId] == address(0), "token already exists");
             tokenOwners[tokenId] = to;
             ownedTokensCount[to]++;
             tokenCount++;
         }

         function transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
             require(tokenOwners[tokenId] == from, "sender does not own the token");
             tokenOwners[tokenId] = to;
             ownedTokensCount[from]--;
             ownedTokensCount[to]++;
         }

         function burn(uint256 tokenId) public {
             require(tokenOwners[tokenId] != address(0), "token does not exist");
             address owner = tokenOwners[tokenId];
             tokenOwners[tokenId] = address(0);
             ownedTokensCount[owner]--;
             tokenCount--;
         }
     }

Potential vulnerabilities in the NonFungibleToken contract include:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is a possibility of token ID collision if not properly checked.
- Inconsistent state update: In the transfer function, the state updates may lead to incorrect token ownership counts if the operations are not atomic.
- Insufficient gas: The functions mint, transfer, and burn could potentially run out of gas if operating on a large number of tokens.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: Access control and visibility modifiers are not explicitly defined, leaving room for unauthorized access to critical functions.
