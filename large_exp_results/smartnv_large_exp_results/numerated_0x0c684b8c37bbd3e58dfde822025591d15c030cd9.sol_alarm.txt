The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incomplete state update: The function `startExecute` does not update the `proposal.sTime` value after initializing a new proposal, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state updates in the `execute` function due to the lack of proper synchronization mechanisms, which may result in unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified in the contract, which could lead to accessibility or ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

- Incomplete state update
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
