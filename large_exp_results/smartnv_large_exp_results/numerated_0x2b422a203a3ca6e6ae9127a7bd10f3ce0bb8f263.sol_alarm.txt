Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly validating if the conditions for execution have been met, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract (`startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);`, `proposal.votedAmount += amount;`, `lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));`) that do not have explicit checks for potential integer overflow/underflow issues.
