potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of IDs for proposals. Multiple proposals could potentially have the same ID, leading to confusion or errors in the system.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like "owner" and "votingToken" is not explicitly specified, which could lead to potential unauthorized access or modification of these variables by external contracts.
- Inconsistent state update: The functions like "startExecute" and "endExecute" do not update the state consistently, leading to potential issues with the overall state of the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and inconsistent state update.
