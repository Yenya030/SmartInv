The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public numberOfVotes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote(uint _numVotes) public {
        numberOfVotes[msg.sender] += _numVotes;
        totalVotes += _numVotes;
    }

    function redeemVotes() public {
        require(numberOfVotes[msg.sender] > 0, "No votes to redeem");
        uint redeemedVotes = numberOfVotes[msg.sender];
        totalVotes -= redeemedVotes;
        numberOfVotes[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The totalVotes variable is updated in both the vote and redeemVotes functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the total vote count.
- Integer overflow/underflow: If a large number of votes are cast or redeemed, there is a risk of integer overflow or underflow in the totalVotes variable.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The numberOfVotes mapping is public, allowing anyone to access and potentially manipulate the number of votes for any address.
- Insufficient gas: If the contract operations consume a large amount of gas, it may result in out-of-gas exceptions during execution.
- Missing access control: There is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call the vote and redeemVotes functions, potentially leading to unauthorized operations. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract VotingSystem are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- Missing access control
