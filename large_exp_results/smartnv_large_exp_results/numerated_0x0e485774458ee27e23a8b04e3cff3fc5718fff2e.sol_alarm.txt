Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() does not reset the proposal state after execution, allowing for potential reuse of the same proposal data. This could lead to incorrect logic or unintended behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the intended level of access control or visibility. Depending on the contract design, this could lead to security issues related to unauthorized access or manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function performs a balance check that involves the entire balance of the votingToken contract. If the gas limit is exceeded during this operation, the function may not execute properly, leading to potential issues such as failed execution or unexpected behavior.
