The contract provided for analysis contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering the impact on the state of the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the code snippet but not provided in the contract itself, potentially indicating incorrect visibility or ownership of the function.
