The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without initializing it first, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, which may lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect the full interface.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` checks a condition that involves a potentially expensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`), which may consume a large amount of gas and result in an out-of-gas error.
