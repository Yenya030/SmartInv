The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: In the function startExecute(), the startingBlance variable is spelled incorrectly causing an inconsistent state update.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not provide the required functions.
3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() in TimelockController could potentially run out of gas if the execution of the require statement consumes a large amount of gas.
