The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Business Logic Flaw: In the endExecute function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might not accurately determine the success of the execution based on the comparison of balances.
2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, which may lead to unintended access or modification of this variable.
3) ID Uniqueness Violation: The structure `Proposal` does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, which may lead to confusion or conflicts when handling multiple proposals simultaneously.
