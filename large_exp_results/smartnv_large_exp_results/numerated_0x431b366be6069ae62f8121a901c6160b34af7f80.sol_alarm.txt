Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which can lead to accessibility issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function, which can potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple calls are made in a short span of time.
3) Insufficient gas: If the `endExecute` function requires a significant amount of gas to execute, there is a possibility of running out of gas and not being able to complete the operation, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
