The contract in question contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without ensuring that the previous proposal has been executed, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any access control mechanisms to restrict who can call certain functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may fail if there is not enough gas provided to complete the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an unpredictable state.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
