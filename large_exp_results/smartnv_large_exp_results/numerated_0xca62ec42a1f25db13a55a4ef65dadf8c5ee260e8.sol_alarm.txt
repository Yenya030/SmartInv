Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" statement in the execute function could lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled carefully.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the functions in the contract is not specified, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
