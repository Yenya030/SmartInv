Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without explicitly checking if the transfer of tokens was successful, potentially leading to a scenario where the state is updated even though the token transfer fails.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` performs multiple state changes (token transfer and updating `proposal.votedAmount`) without being wrapped in a single atomic operation, which could result in inconsistent state if one of the operations fails.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define the required functions to fully comply with the standard, potentially leading to issues with token interactions.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
