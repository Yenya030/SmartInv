The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal" struct is being updated in the "startExecute" and "execute" functions without properly checking if the proposal is in a valid state for the update.

2) Atomicity violation: The state updates in the "execute" function are not wrapped in a single atomic operation, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is interrupted midway.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "owner" variable is set to internal, which might not be intended and could lead to ownership control issues.

4) Insufficient gas: There is a potential risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions due to the lack of gas stipend checks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
