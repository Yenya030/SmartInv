The contract to analyze:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) external {
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount * tokenPrice, "Not enough tokens in the contract");
        uint cost = _amount * tokenPrice;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        balances[msg.sender] += cost;
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0, "No balance to withdraw");
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract:
- Inconsistent state update: There is a potential issue with the updating of balances in the buyTokens function where the cost variable is incrementing balances[msg.sender] instead of _amount.
- Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function could potentially have gas issues if the token transfer requires more gas than available when buying tokens.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is publicly accessible, which may not be desired depending on the contract's logic and security requirements.
