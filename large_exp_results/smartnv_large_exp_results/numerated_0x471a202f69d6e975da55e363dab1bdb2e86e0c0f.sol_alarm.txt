The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update - The function endExecute sets the variable lockedFunds without any checking or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract TimelockController is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not have the required functions defined, which could lead to incorrect visibility issues.
