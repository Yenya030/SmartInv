Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering the possibility of reentrancy attacks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` requires a gas-intensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`), which may lead to insufficient gas and transaction failures.
