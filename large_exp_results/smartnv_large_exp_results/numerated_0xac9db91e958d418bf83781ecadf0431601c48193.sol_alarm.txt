The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken.transferFrom" operation in the execute function may potentially lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities as it allows external contracts to call back into the contract.

2) Inconsistent state update: There might be inconsistencies in the state updates of the proposal struct as the votedAmount is updated without any synchronization mechanism, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function might fail due to insufficient gas if the gas limit is too low to execute all the required operations within the function.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
