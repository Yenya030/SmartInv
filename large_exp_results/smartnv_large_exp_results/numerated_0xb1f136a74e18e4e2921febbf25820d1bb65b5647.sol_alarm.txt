The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) privilege escalation: The function adminResetVotes allows the admin to reset votes for any user without proper restrictions in place, which could lead to privilege escalation.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variable admin is public and can be potentially manipulated by external entities, which could lead to ownership control issues. 

Please note that the contract is missing important functionalities such as security checks and access control mechanisms.
