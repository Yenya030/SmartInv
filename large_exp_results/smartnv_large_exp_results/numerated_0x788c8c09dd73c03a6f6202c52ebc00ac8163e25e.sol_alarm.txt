This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute in the TimelockController contract modifies the state variable proposal.votedAmount directly, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract implements the interface IERC20, but it is not clear if the necessary functions are implemented correctly with the right visibility and ownership control.
