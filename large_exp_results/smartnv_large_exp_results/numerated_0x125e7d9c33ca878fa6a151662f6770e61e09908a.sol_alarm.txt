Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` state variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how this value is being used or if it can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is an internal variable, which may limit access to external users or contracts that need to interact with it.

Overall, the contract does not appear to have any critical vulnerabilities, but the issues mentioned above could potentially impact the contract's functionality and security.
