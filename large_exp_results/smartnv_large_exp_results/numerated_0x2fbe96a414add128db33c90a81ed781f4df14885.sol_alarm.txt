Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared without any access modifier, making it public by default. This could potentially expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to the token contract.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` variable is updated directly using the `+=` operator without properly checking for overflow conditions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the amount exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable.
