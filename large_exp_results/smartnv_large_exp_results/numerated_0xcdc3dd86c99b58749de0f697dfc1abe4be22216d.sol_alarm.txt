The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly, which may lead to inconsistencies in the data if not properly handled.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal which may expose it to potential unauthorized access or manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract operations require a significant amount of gas to execute, users may not be able to successfully interact with the contract due to gas limits.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
