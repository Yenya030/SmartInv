Contract Analysis:

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update:
- The method `execute()` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without properly handling concurrency issues, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas:
- The method `endExecute()` may fail to complete its execution if the gas limit is reached due to the potentially high gas consumption of the operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`).

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` mapping are declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for these variables.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
