The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute()" updates the "lockedFunds" variable without ensuring that all necessary conditions for executing the transaction are met, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility: The variables "WETH", "USDC", and "pair" in the contract ExchangeTokens are declared as public, which exposes sensitive information that could be manipulated by external parties.
