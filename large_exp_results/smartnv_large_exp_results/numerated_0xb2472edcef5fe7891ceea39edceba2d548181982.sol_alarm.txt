Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings, but there is no check to ensure that these mappings are updated atomically. This could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions are trying to update the same user's debt and collateral values simultaneously.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs a calculation using balances of tokens in the pair contract. If the balances of the tokens become extremely large or small, there is a risk of integer overflow or underflow in the calculation, leading to incorrect results.
