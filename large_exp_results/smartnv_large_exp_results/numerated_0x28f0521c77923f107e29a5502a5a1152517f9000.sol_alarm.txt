The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are executed simultaneously.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute may require a large amount of gas if the condition in the require statement is not met, potentially leading to Out of Gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
