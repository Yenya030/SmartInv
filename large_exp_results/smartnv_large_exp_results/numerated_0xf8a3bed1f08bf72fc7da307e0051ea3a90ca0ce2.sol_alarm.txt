The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any further checks, which could potentially lead to an inconsistent state if not properly handled.

2) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas consumption of the `execute()` function, it might encounter out-of-gas issues if the gas provided by the caller is not sufficient for the transaction to be completed successfully.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may lead to issues related to visibility and access control if not properly managed.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
