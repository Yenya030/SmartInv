Potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to confusion or manipulation if the same ID is used for multiple proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state updates as the function startExecute sets the proposal struct without checking if a proposal already exists, potentially overwriting existing data.
3) Insecure time-dependent functions: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute rely on block.timestamp for time calculations, making them susceptible to timestamp manipulation.
4) Access control issues: There is no explicit access control mechanism in place to restrict who can call the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute, which may lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
