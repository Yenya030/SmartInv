The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBalanceList` after setting the `proposal`, leading to an inconsistent state if an error occurs after setting the proposal.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security risks.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially fail if the gas limit is exceeded during the execution, leading to unexpected outcomes.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
