Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update in the "startExecute" function where the "startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]" is being updated based on the "getStartingBalance(proposal.addr)" function without proper validation or synchronization.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There is a potential ID uniqueness violation in the "endExecute" function where the "lockedFunds" variable is being updated without ensuring the uniqueness of the identifier to prevent unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: There might be a risk of running out of gas in the "endExecute" function if the gas limit is not set appropriately for the operations being performed, especially when handling the check for "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" which could potentially consume a large amount of gas.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of specific functions and variables are not explicitly defined in the contract, which could lead to accessibility and ownership issues if not handled properly.
