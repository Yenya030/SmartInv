The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    mapping(address => bool) public voted;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(!voted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        votes[msg.sender]++;
        voted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function reset() public {
        require(voted[msg.sender], "Has not voted yet");
        votes[msg.sender] = 0;
        voted[msg.sender] = false;
        totalVotes--;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure the uniqueness of voter addresses, which could potentially allow the same address to manipulate the voting process by voting multiple times.
2) Inconsistent state update: The update to the totalVotes variable is not consistently synchronized with the individual voter's votes and voted mappings, which could lead to incorrect total vote count.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the votes and voted mappings as public could expose sensitive voter information to unauthorized parties, compromising voter privacy and security.
