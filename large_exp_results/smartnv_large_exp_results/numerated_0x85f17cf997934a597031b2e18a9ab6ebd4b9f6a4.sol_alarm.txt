The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the state of the proposal correctly in the execute function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is implemented in the TimelockController contract, but the contract does not implement all the required functions.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas when executing the endExecute function due to the gas-intensive operation of checking the balance of the contract against the total supply of the voting token.
