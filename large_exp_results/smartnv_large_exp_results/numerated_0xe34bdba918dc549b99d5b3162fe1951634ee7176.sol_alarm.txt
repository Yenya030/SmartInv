Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) ID uniqueness violation - The contract does not seem to have any mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

2) Atomicity violation - Operations like updating the `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function are not atomic, leaving room for potential inconsistencies or race conditions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership - It is unclear if the `owner` variable is used for any specific purpose or if it should be designated as a specific role for access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
