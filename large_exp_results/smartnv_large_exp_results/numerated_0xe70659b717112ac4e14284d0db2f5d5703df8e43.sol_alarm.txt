Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or addresses used within the contract, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions is not explicitly defined, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.
3) Inconsistent state update: The state of variables like 'proposal' is being updated without proper synchronization, leading to possible inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract may not allocate enough gas for complex operations, leading to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions properly, leading to potential loss of ethers or vulnerabilities related to ether handling.
