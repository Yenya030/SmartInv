The contract that needs to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is as follows:

contract Vault {
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;
     uint public totalBalance;
     address public owner;

     constructor() public {
          owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function deposit() public payable {
          require(msg.value > 0, "Invalid amount");
          balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
          totalBalance += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
          require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
          require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
          msg.sender.transfer(amount); 
          balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
          totalBalance -= amount;
     }

     function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
          owner = newOwner;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas requirements for its functions which could lead to out of gas errors during execution.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public, which exposes the owner's address publicly. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the owner's address.
