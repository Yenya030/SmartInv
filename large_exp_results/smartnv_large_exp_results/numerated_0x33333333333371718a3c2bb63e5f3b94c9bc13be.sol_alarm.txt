The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) integer overflow/underflow: 
- In the `endExecute()` function, the expression `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` may result in an integer overflow if the balance of `address(this)` is close to the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable.

2) inconsistent state update:
- In the `execute()` function, the line `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` directly modifies the `votedAmount` field of the proposal struct without checking for potential inconsistencies or unauthorized changes.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The `internal owner;` variable is declared as internal, which can lead to potential visibility issues and unauthorized access if not properly managed.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: integer overflow/underflow, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
