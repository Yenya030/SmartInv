Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define visibility for the 'proposal' struct, making it publicly accessible. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposal data.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'execute' function updates the 'votedAmount' of the proposal directly, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled properly.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, potentially leading to conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
