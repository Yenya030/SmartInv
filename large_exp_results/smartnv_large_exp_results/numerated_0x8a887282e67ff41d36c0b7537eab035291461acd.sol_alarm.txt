The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract RewardProgram {
    IERC20 public rewardToken;
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public rewards;
    
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
        _;
    }
    
    function distributeRewards(address recipient, uint amount) public onlyOwner {
        rewards[recipient] += amount;
    }
    
    function claimRewards() public {
        uint reward = rewards[msg.sender];
        rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
        rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, reward);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is not initialized in the contract, making it possible for anyone to become the owner by calling the `onlyOwner` modifier with an address they control.
- Inconsistent state update: The `rewards[recipient] += amount;` line in the `distributeRewards` function can potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update rewards for the same recipient simultaneously.
- Insufficient gas: The `claimRewards` function could run out of gas if the rewards mapping grows too large and requires a lot of gas to reset all values to 0.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
