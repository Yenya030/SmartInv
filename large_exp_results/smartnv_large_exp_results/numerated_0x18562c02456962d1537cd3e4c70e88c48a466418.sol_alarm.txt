The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without checking for existing proposals, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which could expose it to be accessed by unauthorized external contracts, raising ownership concerns.
