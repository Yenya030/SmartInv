In the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without checking if the proposal has already been executed, which may lead to incorrect state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the `lockedFunds` variable, which could lead to potential issues with ownership and visibility control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
