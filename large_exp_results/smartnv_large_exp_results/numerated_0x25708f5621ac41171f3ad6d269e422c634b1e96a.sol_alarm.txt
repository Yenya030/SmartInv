Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated without proper synchronization or checks in the `endExecute` function, which could lead to inconsistent state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, but it is not clear if it should be restricted in visibility to only be accessed within the contract. This lack of clarity on ownership visibility can lead to potential security issues.
