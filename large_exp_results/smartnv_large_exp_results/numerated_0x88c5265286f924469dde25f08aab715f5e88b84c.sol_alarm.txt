The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any check or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `lockedFunds` variable, which might lead to unintentional access or modification.

3) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` in the `endExecute()` function seems to have a logical flaw in its calculation, which could affect the execution logic.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
