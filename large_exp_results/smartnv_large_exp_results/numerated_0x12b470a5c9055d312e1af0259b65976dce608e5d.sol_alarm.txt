The contract provided for analysis:

contract StakingPool {
    mapping(address => uint) public stakedBalance;
    mapping(address => uint) public rewardsBalance;
    address public token;

    function stake(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot stake 0 tokens");
        stakedBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function unstake(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot unstake 0 tokens");
        require(stakedBalance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient staked balance");
        stakedBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function claimReward() external {
        uint reward = calculateReward(msg.sender);
        rewardsBalance[msg.sender] += reward;
        rewardsBalance[token] -= reward;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, reward);
    }

    function calculateReward(address user) internal view returns(uint) {
        // calculate reward based on staked amount and duration
    }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The token variable is declared as public, potentially exposing sensitive information about the token contract to all external parties.
- Insufficient gas: The claimReward function might require significant gas costs if the rewardsBalance[token] value is too high, risking potential out-of-gas errors during execution.
