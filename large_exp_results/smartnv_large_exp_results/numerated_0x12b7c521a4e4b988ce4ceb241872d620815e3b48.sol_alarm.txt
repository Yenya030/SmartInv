The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, leaving them potentially accessible externally, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
2) inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votingToken.transferFrom` and `proposal.votedAmount += amount` operations should be executed atomically to ensure that the state is updated consistently.
3) integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculation `proposal.votedAmount += amount` if the sum exceeds the maximum value for a uint256 variable. 
4) insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to insufficient gas if the `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply())` check consumes too much gas. It could potentially prevent the function from completing successfully.
5) inconsistent state update: In the `liquidate` function, the transfer of tokens from the `USDC` and `WETH` contracts should be executed atomically to avoid inconsistent state updates.

Overall, the contract shows potential vulnerabilities related to state updates, integer handling, visibility, and gas consumption.
