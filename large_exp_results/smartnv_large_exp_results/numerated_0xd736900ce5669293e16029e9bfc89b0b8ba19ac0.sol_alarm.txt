Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the state variables `owner` and `votingToken`, leaving them as internal by default, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being increased in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than what is provided, resulting in a failed transaction.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposals, potentially leading to duplicate or conflicting proposals.

5) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function has multiple state-changing operations that are not wrapped in a single transaction, which could result in partial execution and inconsistent state.

6) Ether leakage: There is no explicit handling of Ether transactions within the contract, which may lead to unintended loss of Ether.
