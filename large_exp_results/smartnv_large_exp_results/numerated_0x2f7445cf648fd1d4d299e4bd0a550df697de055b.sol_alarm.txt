This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions without restriction.
2) inconsistent state update: The execution of the execute function does not ensure atomicity when updating the votedAmount field of the Proposal struct, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) improper gas estimation: The endExecute function could potentially fail due to insufficient gas when transferring funds, as it does not handle gas estimation properly.
