Contract Analysis:

The contract provided for analysis:
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Business logic flaw: The contract lacks robustness in ensuring the proper sequencing and execution of functions related to proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: There may be issues with maintaining consistent states of proposals and voting amounts.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions could be vulnerable to manipulation.

Overall Assessment: The contract may be vulnerable to exploitation due to the identified potential vulnerabilities.
