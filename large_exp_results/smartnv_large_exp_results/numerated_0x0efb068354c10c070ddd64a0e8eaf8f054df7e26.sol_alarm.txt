potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals or users, which could lead to conflicts or incorrect data handling.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state update for proposal.votedAmount in the execute function is not correctly synchronized, potentially leading to incorrect accounting of voted amounts.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not specified, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical contract functions.
