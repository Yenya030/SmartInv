The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Insecure Dependency: The contract is inheriting from the interface IERC20, but the implementation of the interface is not provided, which could lead to privilege escalation.
2) Lack of Access Control: The owner variable is declared but not utilized for access control, leading to potential privilege escalation.
3) Lack of input validation: The execute function does not check if the amount passed is valid, which could lead to arithmetic flaws.
4) Lack of Reentrancy Guard: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks due to the absence of reentrancy guards in the transfer operations.
5) Insufficient Gas Limit: The endExecute function might fail if the gas limit is insufficient for the required computation.
6) Inconsistent State Update: There might be inconsistencies in updating the state of the contract due to potential race conditions during execution.
