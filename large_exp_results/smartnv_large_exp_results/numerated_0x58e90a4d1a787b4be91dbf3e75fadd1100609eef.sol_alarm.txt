This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Atomicity violation: The operations in functions like startExecute() and execute() are not atomic, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are executed concurrently.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the contract may become inconsistent if certain functions are called in an unexpected order or with incorrect parameters.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution of certain functions, leading to incomplete or failed transactions.
5) Ether leakage: There is a lack of proper handling of ether transactions, which could lead to unintended ether leakage or loss.
