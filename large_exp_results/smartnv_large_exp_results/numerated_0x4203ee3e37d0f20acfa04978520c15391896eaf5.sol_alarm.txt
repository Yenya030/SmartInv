The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The locking and unlocking of funds in the endExecute function could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple proposals are being processed concurrently.
2) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit is reached during the execution of functions, it may result in failed transactions or unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions may not be correctly set, potentially leading to unauthorized access or unintended changes to the contract state.
