Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility: The functions `startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`, `liquidate`, and `calculatePrice` are all marked as `external`, which may not be necessary and could potentially expose the contract to unnecessary risks. It is advisable to carefully consider the visibility specifier for each function to ensure the contract's security.

Additionally, there is a typo in the function `calculatePrice`, where the function definition uses `calculatePrice` but the actual logic inside the function refers to `getPrice()`. This inconsistency could potentially lead to unexpected behavior and should be corrected for clarity and correctness.
