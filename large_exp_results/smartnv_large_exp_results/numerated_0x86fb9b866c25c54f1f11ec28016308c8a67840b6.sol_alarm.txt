Based on the contract you provided, here are the potential vulnerabilities identified:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains functions that update the state of the proposal (such as `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute`) without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent states within the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables like `proposal`, `startingBlance`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which can lead to potential visibility issues or unintended changes by external contracts.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving integers (`proposal.votedAmount += amount`) that could potentially result in integer overflow if not properly handled.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract utilizes external calls (e.g. `votingToken.transferFrom`) without considering the gas limit, which may lead to out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, integer overflow/underflow, and insufficient gas.
