The contract provided:

contract OrderManagement {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint256 => Order) public orders;

    struct Order {
        uint256 orderId;
        address customer;
        uint256 orderAmount;
        bool isProcessed;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function createOrder(uint256 _orderId, address _customer, uint256 _orderAmount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can create orders");
        orders[_orderId] = Order(_orderId, _customer, _orderAmount, false);
    }

    function processOrder(uint256 _orderId) public {
        Order storage order = orders[_orderId];
        require(msg.sender == order.customer, "Only customer can process the order");
        require(order.isProcessed == false, "Order has already been processed");
        // Process the order
        order.isProcessed = true;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The processOrder function only checks if the sender is the customer and does not verify if the owner permits the order processing. 
2) Inconsistent state update: The processOrder function updates the isProcessed status of the order but does not include any additional checks or safeguards.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership and inconsistent state update.
