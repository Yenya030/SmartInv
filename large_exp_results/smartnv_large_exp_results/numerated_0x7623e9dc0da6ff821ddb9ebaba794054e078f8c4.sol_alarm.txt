The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: the variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization or verification, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: the `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using proper atomic operations, potentially leading to atomicity violations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns depending on the contract's design and intentions. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
