The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may lead to ownership control issues.

2) Inconsistent state update: The proposal state variables are updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

3) Atomicity violation: The operations within the functions such as startExecute() and execute() are not atomic, which could result in unexpected behavior if interrupted.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The proposal struct lacks a unique identifier, potentially leading to conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.

5) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may run out of gas if the condition checking the balance causes the gas limit to be exceeded, leading to transaction failures.
