Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The owner variable is internal, making it accessible to inheriting contracts. This may lead to improper access control and privilege escalation.

2) Inconsistent state update:
- The execution of the execute function updates the proposal's votedAmount without proper synchronization measures, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The endExecute function may fail to complete the required actions if there is not enough gas provided, which can result in unexpected behavior or failed execution.

4) Integer overflow/underflow:
- There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that can potentially lead to integer overflows or underflows if not properly handled, such as in the endExecute function when calculating lockedFunds.

5) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The votingToken and lockedFunds variables are not declared with visibility specifiers, leaving them potentially accessible from outside the contract or inheriting contracts.

6) Business logic flaw:
- The endExecute function condition for checking if the execution was successful by comparing the balance of the contract to twice the total supply of votingToken may not accurately represent the success of the execution, leading to incorrect decisions.
