Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the functions and variables in the contract is not specified. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities related to access control.
- Inconsistent state update: The execution function updates the state variables without proper checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Integer overflow: There are potential vulnerabilities related to integer overflow/underflow in the contract, especially in the liquidate function where calculations are performed without proper checks.
- Ether leakage: There are potential vulnerabilities related to ether leakage in the contract, especially in the liquidate function where transfers are made without proper checks or safeguards.
