The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function may not update the `lockedFunds` variable correctly, as it only sets the value but does not specify what it should be set to.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables do not have any visibility specified, which could lead to issues with visibility and ownership control.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function includes a loop that checks if the execution has failed, which may consume too much gas and result in the function failing to execute successfully.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious users.
