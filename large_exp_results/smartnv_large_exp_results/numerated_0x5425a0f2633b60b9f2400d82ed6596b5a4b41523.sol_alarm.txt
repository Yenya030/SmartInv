This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the proposal struct but does not have a proper check for reentrancy or ensuring that the state is updated atomically. This can lead to inconsistent data state.

2) integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple operations involving integer calculations in the contract without proper checks for potential overflows or underflows, such as in the `liquidate` function calculating `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: It's unclear if the ownership of the contract is properly managed and if the visibility of certain functions is appropriately set to prevent unauthorized access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
