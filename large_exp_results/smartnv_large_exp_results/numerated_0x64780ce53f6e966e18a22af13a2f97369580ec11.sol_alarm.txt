The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute(uint256 amount)` updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The interface `IERC20` is used in the contract, but the contract itself does not seem to properly implement all the required functions from the interface, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership of functions.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` may require excessive gas to perform the required operations, especially if the contract holds a large amount of tokens, which could lead to insufficient gas for the transaction to be completed successfully. 

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
