The contract provided seems to contain potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Insufficient Gas: There are functions that involve token transfers, which could potentially run out of gas if the gas provided is not enough for the transfer operation.
2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which could lead to issues with contract ownership visibility and management. 
3) Business Logic Flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws due to the lack of certain checks and balances in the functions, such as the execute function not properly checking for the total voted amount before proceeding with the transfer.
