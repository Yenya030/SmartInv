This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` based on a condition that checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total token supply, which may lead to an inconsistent state if the condition is not properly validated.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to collisions and unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
