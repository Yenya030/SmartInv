Contract to analyze: 

contract AssetManagement {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential vulnerability in the withdrawal function where the subtraction operation (`balances[msg.sender] -= amount;`) could result in an integer underflow if the amount to be withdrawn exceeds the balance.
- Ether leakage: The transfer operation in the withdrawal function could lead to ether leakage if it is not handled properly.
- Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions, especially if the balances mapping grows too large.
- Correct visibility/ownership: The visibility of the balances mapping could be made private to prevent external access to it. Ownership considerations should also be taken into account to ensure proper authorization.
