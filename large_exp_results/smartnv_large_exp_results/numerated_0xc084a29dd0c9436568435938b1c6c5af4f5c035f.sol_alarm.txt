Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Consistent state update: The update of "lockedFunds" in the "endExecute" function could potentially be inconsistent as it doesn't account for reentrancy issues or other potential race conditions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "votedProposal" function is not specified, which could lead to potential accessibility and ownership concerns.
