The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update - The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without checking if there is an ongoing proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas - The function endExecute() checks the balance of the contract and total supply of the token in one line, which may require excessive gas if the token has a large supply, leading to insufficient gas error.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20, but it does not define the required functions, potentially leading to incorrect visibility.
4) Business logic flaw - The function endExecute() contains a business logic flaw where it checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply, which may not be the intended execution condition.
