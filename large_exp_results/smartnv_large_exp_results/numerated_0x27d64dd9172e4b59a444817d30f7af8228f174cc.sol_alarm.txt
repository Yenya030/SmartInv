The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "proposal.votedAmount" is directly incremented without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The "lockedFunds" variable is shared across all proposals without any unique identifier, which may violate the uniqueness of IDs.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" and "owner" variables are marked as internal, which may expose them to unintended access and manipulation.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the "endExecute" function due to the gas-intensive operations, potentially leading to incomplete execution.

5) Business logic flaw: The condition "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" in the "endExecute" function may have a flawed business logic that could impact the contract's behavior.
