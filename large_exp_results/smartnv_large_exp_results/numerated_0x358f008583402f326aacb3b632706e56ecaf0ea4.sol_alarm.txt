The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state but does not check if a proposal is already ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of the endExecute() function, it may fail to complete the required operations and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is internal, which could lead to issues related to contract ownership and access control.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
