The vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votedProposal` function, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent State Update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but it is not checked if the voter has voted before allowing the execution, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient Gas: The `endExecute` function may require a significant amount of gas due to potentially high number of token transfers, which can lead to insufficient gas error.
4) ID Uniqueness Violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier for each proposal, which can lead to ID uniqueness violations.
5) Arithmetic Flaw: In the `liquidate` function, there is a potential arithmetic flaw when calculating the liquidation conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
