The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public token1;
    IERC20 public token2;

    function swap(uint amount1, uint amount2) external {
        token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
        token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
    }
}

Based on the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities include:
- Insufficient gas: The swap function does not have any gas stipend specified, which may lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The token1 and token2 variables are made public, which exposes sensitive information about the tokens to all users.
- Atomicity violation: The swap function does not implement a proper atomic swap mechanism, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Integer overflow/underflow: The amounts passed to the swap function are not validated for potential overflow or underflow issues, which may result in unexpected behavior.
