The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without further actions or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state if the function is called multiple times.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated without any access control modifiers, which may lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the variable.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
