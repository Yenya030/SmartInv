Vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without using atomic operations, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is not implementing the IERC20 interface properly, as it is missing the required functions of the interface. So, the incorrect visibility/ownership issue could arise.

Therefore, there are potential vulnerabilities in the contract.
