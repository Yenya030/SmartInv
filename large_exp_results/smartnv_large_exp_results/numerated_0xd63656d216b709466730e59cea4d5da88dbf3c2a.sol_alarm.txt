The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not specified, which can lead to accessibility issues.
- Inconsistent state update: The state variables like startingBlance and lockedFunds are being updated without proper validation or synchronization.
- Insufficient gas: The gas required for executing functions like endExecute() may exceed the gas limit, causing the transaction to fail.
