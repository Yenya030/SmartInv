The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable without any mechanism to ensure that the state changes are consistent or atomic.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface, but it is not clear if the necessary functions are implemented with the correct visibility (public/external/internal/private) or ownership.
