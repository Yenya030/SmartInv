Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility: The functions `votedProposal` and `getStartingBalance` are not defined in the contract, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities if they are supposed to be internal functions but are accessible externally.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` in the `execute` function directly updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without performing additional checks or validations, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a check on the balance of the contract using `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which might require significant gas to execute, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

4) Privilege escalation: There are no access control mechanisms implemented in the contract, allowing any user to call the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions, which could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions or have functions to send or receive Ether, but if the `votingToken` is an ERC20 token that allows Ether transfers, there might be potential vulnerabilities related to Ether leakage.

6) Ownership: The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined or implemented, potentially leading to ownership vulnerabilities if the `owner` variable is not properly managed or secured.

7) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations in the contract that involve addition and division, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities if not properly checked and handled.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Privilege escalation
- Ether leakage
- Ownership
- Integer overflow/underflow
