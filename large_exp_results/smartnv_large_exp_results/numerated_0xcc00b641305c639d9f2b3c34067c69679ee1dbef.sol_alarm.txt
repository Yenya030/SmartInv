Contract:

    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
