The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract at the end of execution, which may not always accurately represent the total locked funds due to potential changes in the balance during execution.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the `calculatePrice()` function if the balance of USDC or WETH exceeds the maximum uint value, leading to incorrect calculations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `votedProposal` function, which may make it publicly accessible when it should be restricted to certain entities only.
