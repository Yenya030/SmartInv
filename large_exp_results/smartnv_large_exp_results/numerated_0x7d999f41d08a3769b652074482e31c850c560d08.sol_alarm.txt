Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistent state update issue in the `endExecute()` function where the `lockedFunds` variable is updated based on the balance of the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes before the function completes.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility and could lead to issues related to ownership control.

3) Suicidal contracts: There is no explicit implementation of a self-destruct function, but if added carelessly, it could lead to the contract becoming a suicidal contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Suicidal contracts
