Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not implement access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to specific users, potentially allowing unauthorized users to invoke critical functions.

2) inconsistent state update: The update of `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute` function could lead to inconsistent state if the function is called multiple times with different conditions.

3) integer overflow/underflow: Operations involving addition or subtraction of unsigned integers should be carefully monitored to prevent potential overflow or underflow issues.

4) arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function involving the multiplication and division of amounts should be reviewed to ensure accuracy and prevent potential arithmetic flaws.

5) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions should be carefully set to restrict access and prevent unauthorized modifications. Ownership of critical functions should also be clearly defined to prevent unauthorized changes.
