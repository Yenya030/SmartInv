The contract to be analyzed:

<\contract_to_analyze\> 

contract VotingSystem {
         struct Voter {
             uint weight;
             bool voted;
             address delegate;
             uint vote;
         }

         mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
         address public admin;

         function giveRightToVote(address voter) public {
             require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can give the right to vote");
             voters[voter].weight = 1;
         }

         function delegate(address to) public {
             require(voters[msg.sender].weight >= 1, "Not enough weight to delegate");
             require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed");
             while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
                 to = voters[to].delegate;
                 require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation");
             }
             voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;
         }

         function vote(uint option) public {
             Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
             require(sender.weight >= 1, "Not enough weight to vote");
             require(!sender.voted, "Already voted");
             sender.voted = true;
             sender.vote = option;
         }
} 

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: The `giveRightToVote` function does not check if the voter already has the right to vote, potentially allowing multiple rights to be assigned to the same address.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is public, which exposes the admin address to all users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to administrative privileges.
