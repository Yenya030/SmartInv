The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract swaps tokens without checking if the transfer is successful, which may lead to an inconsistent state if one of the transfers fails.
2) Insufficient gas: If the contract encounters a situation where gas costs exceed the specified amount, the swap function may not be completed successfully.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the constructor, which may lead to potential issues related to contract ownership and visibility.
