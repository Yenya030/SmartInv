Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a large amount of gas if the condition "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" is not optimized, leading to potential gas exhaustion issues.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of variables and functions are not clearly defined, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by unauthorized parties. 

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
