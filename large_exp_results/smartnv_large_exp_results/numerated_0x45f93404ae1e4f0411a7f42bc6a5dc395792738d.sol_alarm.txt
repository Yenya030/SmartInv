Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for the variables and functions, making them publicly accessible by anyone.
- Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` modifies the `lockedFunds` variable without any validation or checks on the current state, which may lead to inconsistent data.
- Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a balance comparison operation that may consume excess gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
- Business logic flaw: The condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` in the `endExecute()` function may have a business logic flaw, depending on the intended functionality of the contract.

Overall assessment: The contract contains vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure its security and reliability.
