Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without ensuring that the proposal struct is properly initialized, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the execution, leading to potential issues with the contract.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It's not clear if the owner variable is properly managed and whether it should be publicly accessible or not, which could lead to ownership control vulnerabilities.
