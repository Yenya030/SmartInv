Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the votingToken variable is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the token.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable based on a condition that may lead to inconsistent state if not properly handled.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculatePrice function in ExchangeTokens contract performs arithmetic operations that may result in integer overflow/underflow if not properly validated.
