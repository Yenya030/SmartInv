The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- 9) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract doesn't have checks to prevent integer underflow in the withdraw function, which can lead to a negative balance.
- 13) Insufficient gas: The withdraw function uses the transfer function, which has a gas limit of 2300. If the recipient's fallback function requires more gas, the transaction might fail.
- 14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, which exposes the balances of all users to the public. It would be more secure to make it private or internal.
