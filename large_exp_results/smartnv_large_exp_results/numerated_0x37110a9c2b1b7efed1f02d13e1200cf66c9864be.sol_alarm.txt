The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` modifies the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring that it is correctly updated, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer underflow in the `liquidate()` function where the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` may result in an underflow if the values are not properly checked.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and integer overflow/underflow.
