The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'durationPaid' variable is updated without any check or restriction, which can lead to unexpected state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'beneficiary' variable is declared as public, which exposes it to be modified by anyone.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'transfer' function can potentially fail if the recipient is a contract with a high gas consumption, leading to transaction revert.
