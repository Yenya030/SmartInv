The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only be called by authorized users.
2) inconsistent state update: There are scenarios where the state variables like proposal.votedAmount and lockedFunds are updated without proper synchronization or checks, leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) atomicity violation: Multiple operations within functions like execute() and endExecute() are not handled atomically, leading to potential race condition issues.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions in the contract is not properly specified, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access to critical functions.
