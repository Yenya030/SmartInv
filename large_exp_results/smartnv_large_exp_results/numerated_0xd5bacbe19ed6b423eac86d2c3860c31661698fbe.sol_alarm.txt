Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the "owner" variable, making it publicly accessible. This can lead to potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" variable is updated in the "execute" function, but there is no guarantee that the state update is consistent. This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to conflicts and vulnerabilities.
4) Atomicity violation: The operations in the "execute" function are not wrapped in a single transaction, which can lead to atomicity violations and vulnerabilities.
5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas exceptions, which can lead to vulnerabilities if transactions fail due to gas limits.
