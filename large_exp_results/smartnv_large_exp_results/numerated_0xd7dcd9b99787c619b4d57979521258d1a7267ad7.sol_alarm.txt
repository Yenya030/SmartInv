The contract you provided has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state of the proposal without checking for existing proposals or any validation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could potentially lead to conflicts or incorrect processing of proposals.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the votingToken variable, which can lead to potential ownership and visibility issues.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed for secure execution.
