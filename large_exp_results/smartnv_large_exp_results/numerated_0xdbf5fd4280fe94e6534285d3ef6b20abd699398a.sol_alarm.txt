The contract provided for analysis:

contract MultiSigWallet {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Output: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The 'owner' variable is public and can be directly accessed, which may lead to unauthorized access and ownership changes.
2) Insufficient gas - The function 'withdraw' does not include a proper gas stipend for potential external calls, which may result in failed withdrawals due to insufficient gas.
