The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Atomicity violation: In the `execute` function, the transfer of tokens and updating of the `votedAmount` should be done atomically to prevent inconsistencies in the state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal` which may expose sensitive information and ownership control.

3) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` and `endExecute` functions update the state of the `proposal` struct independently, leading to potential inconsistencies.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a large computation to check if the execution failed, which might require more gas than available in a single transaction.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
