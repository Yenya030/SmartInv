The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates in the functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` may fail to execute due to running out of gas when checking the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables `debt` and `collateral` are public, exposing sensitive data to all external parties, which could be a security risk.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
