This contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to start and execute proposals.

2) inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal and its voted amount are updated independently in the `execute` function, which may lead to inconsistencies.

3) atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not atomic, allowing external manipulation of the voted amount before it is updated.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` used in the contract is not properly defined, which could lead to ownership or visibility issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
