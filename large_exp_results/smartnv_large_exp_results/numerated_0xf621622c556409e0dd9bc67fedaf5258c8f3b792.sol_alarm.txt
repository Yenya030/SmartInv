The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without further checks, which can lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.

2) Incorrect visibility: The `calculatePrice` function is marked as public and payable, but it does not seem to handle or interact with any incoming Ether. This could be misleading and lead to incorrect usage by external callers.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility
