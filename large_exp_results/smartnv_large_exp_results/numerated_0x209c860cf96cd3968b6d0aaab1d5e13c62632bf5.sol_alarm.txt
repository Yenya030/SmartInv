Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is updated without proper synchronization or protection, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is not marked as private, potentially allowing external contracts to read and manipulate its data directly.
