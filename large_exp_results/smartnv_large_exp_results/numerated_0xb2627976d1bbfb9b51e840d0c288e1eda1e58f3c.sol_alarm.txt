The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update in the contract due to the "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" line in the execute function where the votedAmount is updated directly without any synchronization mechanisms.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential integer overflow in the liquidate function where the multiplication operation "getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100" could lead to an overflow if the values are large enough.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables in the contract is not clearly defined, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract state by external entities. 

4) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function relies on a calculation based on the getPrice() function, which may not accurately reflect the true value of the assets being liquidated, leading to potential loss for users.
