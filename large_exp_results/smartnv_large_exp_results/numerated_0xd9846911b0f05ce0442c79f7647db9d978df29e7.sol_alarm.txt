Output:
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure uniqueness for voter IDs, which might lead to inconsistent behavior or manipulation.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is defined as public, exposing sensitive information to all users, which can lead to unauthorized access and control.
- Privilege escalation: There is a potential privilege escalation vulnerability in the delegate function where a user can delegate voting rights to another address without proper validation.
