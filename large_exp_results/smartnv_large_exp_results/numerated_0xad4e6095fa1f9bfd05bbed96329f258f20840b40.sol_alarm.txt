Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct but does not reset the `votedAmount` field to zero, which could lead to incorrect state management.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the proposal data.
