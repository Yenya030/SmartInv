Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals have the same ID.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that it is done atomically, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might fail if there is not enough gas to execute all the required operations, which can result in the function not completing successfully.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility (public, internal, private) of certain variables and functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.

Therefore, potential vulnerabilities in the contract include ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
