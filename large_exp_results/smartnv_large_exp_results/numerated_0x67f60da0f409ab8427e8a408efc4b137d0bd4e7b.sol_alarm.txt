Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute might result in an inconsistent state update as it checks for a condition that may not hold true after the transaction. This can lead to unexpected behavior or outcomes.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the liquidate function of the ExchangeTokens contract where the calculation involving getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 could lead to an overflow if the values are sufficiently large.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the debt and collateral mappings in the ExchangeTokens contract is set to public, which exposes these sensitive data to all external actors. It is recommended to use more restricted access controls for critical data. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Integer overflow/underflow
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
