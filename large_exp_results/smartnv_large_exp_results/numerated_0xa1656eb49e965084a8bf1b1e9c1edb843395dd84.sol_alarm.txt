The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) business logic flaw: the execute function allows for the same proposal to be executed multiple times by incrementing votedAmount without any check, potentially leading to unintended or malicious behavior.
2) inconsistent state update: the endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable without resetting the proposal state, potentially leading to inaccurate state representation.
