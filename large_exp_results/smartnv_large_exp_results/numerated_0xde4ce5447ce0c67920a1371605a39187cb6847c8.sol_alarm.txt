contract PaymentProcessor {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balance;
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
} 

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership in the balance mapping, as it is declared as public which exposes all user balances publicly.
- Insufficient gas could potentially arise if the contract's methods require more gas to execute than the user provides.
- Ether leakage due to the use of transfer in the withdraw function, which can lead to Ether being locked in the contract if the receiving address has a fallback function that consumes too much gas.
