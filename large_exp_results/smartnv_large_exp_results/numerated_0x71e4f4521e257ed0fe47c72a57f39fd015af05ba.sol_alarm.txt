Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds`, `votedProposal`, and `startingBalanceList` variables are not declared or defined in the contract, potentially leading to issues related to visibility or ownership.
- Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates happening within the `execute` function without using safe arithmetic operations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute if the gas limit is reached due to potentially high gas costs from the `require` statement checking for balance conditions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Insufficient gas
