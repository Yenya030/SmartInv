The contract provided for analysis:
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;

    constructor(uint _amount) public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = new ERC20(_amount);
    }

    function buyToken(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.value == _amount, "Incorrect payment amount");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Sender is not the owner");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) privilege escalation
2) inconsistent state update
