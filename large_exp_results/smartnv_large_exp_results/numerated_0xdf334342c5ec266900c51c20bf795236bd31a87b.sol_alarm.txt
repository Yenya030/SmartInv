Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the state variables owner, votingToken, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds, which could lead to potential issues with accessibility and ownership control.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are no checks in the execute function to ensure that the voting process has been completed before transferring tokens and updating the proposal's votedAmount. This could lead to an inconsistent state where tokens are transferred without proper validation.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the endExecute function when checking if the lockedFunds exceed double the total supply of the votingToken. This could result in inaccurate calculations and unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function potentially requires a large amount of gas to check the balance of the votingToken contract, which could lead to out-of-gas errors when executing the function on the Ethereum network.
