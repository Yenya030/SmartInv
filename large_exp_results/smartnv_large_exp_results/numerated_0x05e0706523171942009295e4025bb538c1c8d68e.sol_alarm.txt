The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute()` function is updated without any proper synchronization mechanism, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined as public, internal, or external in the contract, which may lead to incorrect visibility and ownership concerns.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
