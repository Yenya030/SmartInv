The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the state variable lockedFunds without checking any conditions and it may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables WETH, USDC, and pair in the ExchangeTokens contract are set to public, which can expose sensitive information and also lack proper access control.
3) Insufficient gas: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract transfers tokens without considering the gas limit, which can make the function fail due to insufficient gas provided.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
