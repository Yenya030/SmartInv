Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables `WETH`, `USDC`, `pair`, `debt`, and `collateral` should be updated to private to prevent external manipulation.
2) Business logic flaw: The `liquidate` function may have a flaw in the logic as it could potentially allow malicious users to manipulate the liquidation process by adjusting their collateral or debt amounts to avoid liquidation.
3) Price manipulation: The `calculatePrice` function may be vulnerable to price manipulation if the tokens' balances are tampered with before calculating the price.
