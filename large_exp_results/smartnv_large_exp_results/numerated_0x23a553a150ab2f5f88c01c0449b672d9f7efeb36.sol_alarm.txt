Contract Analysis:

The contract provided for analysis:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
     }
     address internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 
        }

    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) * 2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The Proposal struct does not have a unique identifier, making it susceptible to ID duplication or conflicts.
2) Arithmetic flaw: There may be potential arithmetic flaws in the calculation of startingBalance or votedAmount, leading to unexpected results.
3) Inconsistent state update: There could be inconsistencies in updating the state variables like proposal.sTime, proposal.votedAmount, etc., leading to unexpected behavior.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions within the contract should be carefully reviewed to ensure proper access control and ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are ID uniqueness violation, arithmetic flaw, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
