The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract Payment {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalPayments;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function makePayment(address _recipient, uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        balances[_recipient] += _amount;
        
        totalPayments += _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(_amount);
    }
}
```

Based on the analysis of the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) `insufficient gas`: The `withdraw` function transfers funds to the caller using `msg.sender.transfer(_amount)`, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors if the gas stipend is not enough for the recipient to handle the incoming transfer.

2) `incorrect visibility/ownership`: The `owner` variable is declared as public, which exposes it to all users. It is advisable to make this variable `private` or to provide a function to access the owner address rather than having it public.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are insufficient gas and incorrect visibility/ownership.
