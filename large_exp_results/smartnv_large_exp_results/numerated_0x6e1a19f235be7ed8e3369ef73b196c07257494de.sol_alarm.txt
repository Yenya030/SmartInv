The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute can be vulnerable to inconsistent state update as it does not use a mutex/lock to prevent concurrent execution.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal state owner is not properly managed and could potentially lead to unauthorized access.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function might require a large amount of gas due to the calculation involving the balance of the token contract, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
