Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` based on the balance of `votingToken`, which may lead to inconsistent state if the balances change before the function completes.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks the balance of `votingToken` and performs multiple operations within the same function, which might require a significant amount of gas to execute, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The function `startExecute()` and `execute()` are marked as external, but they access internal variables such as `proposal`, which might be intended for internal use only. This could expose the contract to unauthorized access or manipulation.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
