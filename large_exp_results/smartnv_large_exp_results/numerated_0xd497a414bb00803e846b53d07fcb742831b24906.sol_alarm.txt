Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as public, which could expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposals or addresses, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
