Contract to be analyzed:
contract PaymentGateway {
     uint public totalPayments;
     mapping (address => uint) public balances;

     function makePayment() public payable {
           balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
           totalPayments += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
           require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
           balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
           totalPayments -= amount;
           (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
           require(success, "Transfer failed");
     }
} 

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Reentrancy
2) Insufficient gas
