The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` tries to check if the execution has failed by ensuring the locked funds are more than double the total token supply. However, the check for execution failure `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` may not accurately reflect the state of the execution.

2) Insufficient gas: There is a potential risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions that involve multiple token transfers, such as the `execute` function if the gas limit is not set high enough.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to enforce unique proposals, leading to potential issues if multiple proposals are being processed at the same time.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and ID uniqueness violation.
