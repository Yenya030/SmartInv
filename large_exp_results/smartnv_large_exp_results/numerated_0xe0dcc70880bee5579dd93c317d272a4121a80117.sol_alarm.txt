The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are public, which exposes sensitive data to anyone who interacts with the contract. This could lead to privacy breaches and potential attacks.

2) Integer underflow: In the `liquidate` function, there is a risk of integer underflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount` if the values are not properly checked and validated.

3) Incorrect state update: There is a lack of proper checks and validation in the `liquidate` function, which may lead to inconsistent state updates and result in unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility, integer underflow, and inconsistent state update.
