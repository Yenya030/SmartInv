The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is not updated consistently in the `startExecute` function. Since `proposal` is not initialized properly, it may lead to inconsistent state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not specified with any visibility modifier, making it public, which could expose sensitive data. Additionally, the `votingToken` variable is not specified with an access control modifier, making it public, which could pose a security risk.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership.
