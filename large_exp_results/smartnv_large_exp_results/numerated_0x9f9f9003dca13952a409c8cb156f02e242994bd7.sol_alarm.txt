Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without considering potential reentrancy issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which might lead to ownership vulnerabilities if not properly controlled.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function might fail if the gas provided is not enough to complete the required operations.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal identifiers, which could lead to issues with multiple proposals having the same ID.
