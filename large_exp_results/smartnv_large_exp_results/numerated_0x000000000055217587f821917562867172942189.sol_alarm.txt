The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms which could lead to unauthorized users performing privileged actions.
2) inconsistent state update: There are opportunities for state variables to be updated in an inconsistent manner, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
3) atomicity violation: The functions in the contract may not ensure atomicity, allowing for partial execution of operations and leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
4) ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, which could result in unintended ether loss or theft.
