The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Insufficient gas - The contract might run out of gas during execution if gas limits are not appropriately set.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not specified, which could lead to potential security risks.

3) Integer overflow/underflow - There is a potential risk of integer overflow/underflow in the calculations involving balances and amounts.

4) Inconsistent state update - In certain functions, state variables are updated without proper checks, leading to inconsistent state changes.

5) ID uniqueness violation - There is a risk of violating ID uniqueness in the implementation of proposals and addresses.

6) Atomicity violation - Certain operations appear to be non-atomic, which can lead to unexpected results if interrupted.

7) Cross bridge inconsistency - There might be consistency issues between different bridges or connections within the contract.

8) Ether leakage - There is a risk of unintended loss or leakage of ether due to transfer functions not properly handled.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, integer overflow/underflow, inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, atomicity violation, cross bridge inconsistency, and ether leakage.
