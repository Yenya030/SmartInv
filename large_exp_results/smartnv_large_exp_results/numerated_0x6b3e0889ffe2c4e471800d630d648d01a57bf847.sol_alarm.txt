The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) business logic flaw: The function `endExecute` may not accurately check if the execution has failed due to the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`.

2) atomicity violation: The function `execute` may not handle atomic operations correctly when updating `proposal.votedAmount`.

3) inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` may result in inconsistent state updates when setting the `proposal` struct.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, atomicity violation, and inconsistent state update.
