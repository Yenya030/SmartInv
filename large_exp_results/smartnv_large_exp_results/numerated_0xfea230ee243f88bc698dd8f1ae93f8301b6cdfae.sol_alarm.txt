The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses proposal.votedAmount as an indicator for whether or not the execution has occurred, but the votedAmount is not reset to 0 after execution. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The code lacks proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity in operations, which may introduce race conditions and unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, leaving it open to potential unauthorized access and manipulation.

4) Insufficient gas: The execute function may require a significant amount of gas due to the operations it performs, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
