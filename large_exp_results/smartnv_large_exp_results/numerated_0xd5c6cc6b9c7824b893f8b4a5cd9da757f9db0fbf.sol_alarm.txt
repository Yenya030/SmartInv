The vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not consider the possibility of external factors affecting the balance during the execution, potentially resulting in an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the "lockedFunds" variable, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to ownership and access control.
