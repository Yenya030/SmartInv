The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The setTokenPrice function allows any caller to change the token price, which should only be allowed for the admin.
2) Ether leakage: The buyTokens function transfers tokens to the buyer but does not handle any potential issues with transferring ether, which could lead to ether being stuck in the contract.
3) Inconsistent state update: The tokensSold variable is updated in the buyTokens function, but there is no check or limit on the total number of tokens sold, which could potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow.
