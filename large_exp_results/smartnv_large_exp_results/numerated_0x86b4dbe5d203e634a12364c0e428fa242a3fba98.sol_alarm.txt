Contract to analyze:

contract TokenSale {
     ERC20 public token;
     address payable public owner;
     address public tokenWallet;
     uint public tokenPrice;
     uint public tokenAmount;

     constructor(ERC20 _token, address _tokenWallet, uint _tokenPrice, uint _tokenAmount) {
         token = _token;
         owner = msg.sender;
         tokenWallet = _tokenWallet;
         tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
         tokenAmount = _tokenAmount;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _amount) public payable {
         require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Incorrect ETH amount");
         require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount, "Insufficient tokens available");
         token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
     }

     function withdrawTokens() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw tokens");
         token.transfer(tokenWallet, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
     }

     function withdrawETH() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw ETH");
         owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The withdrawal functions allow anyone to call them. This can lead to unauthorized withdrawal of tokens and ETH.
2) Insufficient gas: If the token transfer in the buyTokens function requires more gas than available, the transaction may revert and the buyer may lose the ETH sent.
3) Atomicity violation: The buyTokens function does not ensure atomicity in token transfers and ETH payments, leaving room for potential race conditions or partial executions.
4) Inconsistent state update: Lack of state checks before state updates in the buyTokens function can lead to inconsistent contract states.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for duplicate token IDs being used in the contract, which could cause confusion or unexpected behavior.
