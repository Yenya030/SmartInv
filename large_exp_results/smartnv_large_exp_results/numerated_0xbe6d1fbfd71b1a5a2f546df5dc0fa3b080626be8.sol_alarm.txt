The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute` function is updated without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The access control for functions in the contract is not clearly defined, leading to potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation issues.
