Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any checks or validations, which could lead to incorrect or undesired state changes. 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is declared as public, exposing sensitive data to external parties, which may not be intended.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than available in certain scenarios, leading to the transaction failing before completion.
