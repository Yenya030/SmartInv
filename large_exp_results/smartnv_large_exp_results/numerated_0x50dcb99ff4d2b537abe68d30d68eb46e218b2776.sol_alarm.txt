The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are: 
1) price manipulation: The price for buying tokens is set externally by the owner, which can be manipulated.
2) integer overflow/underflow: Multiplying the amount of tokens with the price may result in integer overflow.
3) inconsistent state update: The transfer of tokens and ether is not atomic, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if one of the transfers fails mid-execution.
