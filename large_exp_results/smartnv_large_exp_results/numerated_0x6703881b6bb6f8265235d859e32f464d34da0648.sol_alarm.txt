The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The constructor should be marked as `public` for visibility.
2) Missing access control: There is no access control mechanism to restrict who can call the `buyTokens` function.
3) Potential integer underflow: There is no validation or safeguard to prevent integer underflow when transferring tokens in the `buyTokens` function.
