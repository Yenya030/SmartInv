Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a comparison with `votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may not accurately reflect the actual locked funds.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` relies on calling `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` which may consume a significant amount of gas and lead to out-of-gas errors, especially if the contract has many token holders.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The implementation of the interface `IERC20` within the `TimelockController` contract could potentially introduce visibility or ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
