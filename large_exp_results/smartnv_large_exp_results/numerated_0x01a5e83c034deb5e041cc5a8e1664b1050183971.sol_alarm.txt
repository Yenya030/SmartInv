The contract for analysis:
```solidity
contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        require(amount > bids[msg.sender], "Bid must be higher than bidder's current bid");

        if (bids[highestBidder] > 0) {
            // Refund the previous highest bidder
            payable(highestBidder).transfer(bids[highestBidder]);
        }

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
        bids[msg.sender] = amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Highest bidder cannot withdraw");
        uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
