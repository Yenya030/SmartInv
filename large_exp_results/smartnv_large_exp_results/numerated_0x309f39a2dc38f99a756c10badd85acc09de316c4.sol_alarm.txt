Contract to analyze:
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _token) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = IERC20(_token);
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Not enough tokens in the contract");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function withdrawTokens() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw tokens");
        token.transfer(owner, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
} 

Output:
1) erroneous disclosure.
