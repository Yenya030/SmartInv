The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenContract {
     address public owner;
     uint256 public totalSupply;
     mapping(address => uint256) balances;

     function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
          require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
          balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
          balances[to] += amount;
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The balances mapping is directly updated without checking for potential reentrancy issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public, which may expose sensitive information about the contract owner to external users.
3) Insufficient gas: The function does not validate if the transfer of tokens may run out of gas, leading to potential disruptions in the token transfer process.
