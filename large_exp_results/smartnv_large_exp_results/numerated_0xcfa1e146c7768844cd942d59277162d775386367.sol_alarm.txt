The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update - The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable, but it does not update the state of the proposal or reset the proposal variables, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas - The function `endExecute` checks if the execution failed based on the balance of the contract, but it does not account for the gas costs that may be deducted from the contract balance during the transaction, potentially leading to incorrect execution outcomes.
