The contract you are going to analyze is:

contract TokenSale {
    uint public tokenPrice;
    address public token;
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(address _token, uint _tokenPrice) {
        token = _token;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        uint totalCost = amount * tokenPrice;
        require(totalCost > 0, "Invalid amount");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
        // Transfer tokens to the buyer
        // Transfer funds to the owner
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        // Transfer funds to the owner
    }

    function setTokenPrice(uint _newPrice) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set token price");
        tokenPrice = _newPrice;
    }
}
