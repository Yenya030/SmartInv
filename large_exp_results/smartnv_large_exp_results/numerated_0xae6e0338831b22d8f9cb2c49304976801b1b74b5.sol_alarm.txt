The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which can lead to accessibility and security issues.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the `votedAmount` variable in the `execute` function when adding the `amount` to it.
3) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the `startingBlance` variable is misspelled, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a significant amount of gas due to potentially looping over all balances, which can lead to out-of-gas errors.
