Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply, which may consume a lot of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not properly define the required functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect a certain interface.
