The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public winningProposal;
    uint256 public winningVoteCount;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0) && voters[to].delegate != msg.sender) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
        Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];

        if (delegateTo.voted) {
            winningVoteCount += sender.weight;
        } else {

1) inconsistent state update
2) atomicity violation
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
