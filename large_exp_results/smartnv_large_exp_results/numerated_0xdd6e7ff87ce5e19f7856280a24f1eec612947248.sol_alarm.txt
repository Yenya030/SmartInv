The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the contract does not specify visibility modifiers for its variables and functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. 
2) Inconsistent state update: there are multiple assignments to the same variable `proposal` without proper handling, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential vulnerabilities.
3) Insufficient gas: there is a complex calculation in the `endExecute` function that involves multiple external calls and comparisons, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) Reentrancy: the `execute` function calls an external contract (votingToken) and updates state variables, which can make the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: there is a calculation in the `liquidate` function that involves multiplication of potentially large numbers, which can result in integer overflow if not handled properly. 

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, reentrancy, and integer overflow/underflow.
