Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables (such as proposal.votedAmount) without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent data state.
2) Insufficient gas: There might be a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, especially if the contract deals with complex calculations or storage operations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables in the contract is not explicitly specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external parties.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have proper checks to ensure the uniqueness of certain identifiers, which could result in unexpected behavior or conflicts.
5) Atomicity violation: The contract lacks atomicity in certain operations, which could result in partial execution of tasks and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transfers securely, potentially leading to ether loss or leakage.
7) Arithmetic flaw: There may be arithmetic flaws present in the contract, leading to unintended outcomes in calculations or operations.
