The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

- Insufficient Gas: The function `calculatePrice()` may run out of gas if the token balance of `USDC` or `WETH` becomes too large, as the division operation could consume a significant amount of gas to complete.

- Arithmetic Flaw: The division operation in the `calculatePrice()` function can potentially lead to arithmetic flaws if the input values are not properly validated or sanitized.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
13) Insufficient gas
10) Arithmetic flaw
