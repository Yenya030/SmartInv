Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not explicitly defined, which could lead to potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated within different functions that could potentially lead to inconsistent states.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a potential risk of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, especially if gas usage is not properly controlled.
