Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `lockedFunds` variables are not specified with any visibility keyword, making them publicly accessible. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of these variables.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` is updated directly without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: If the `endExecute` function requires a large amount of gas for execution, there is a possibility that the transaction might run out of gas and fail to complete.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which can lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
5) Privilege escalation: The `votingToken.transferFrom` function can potentially be exploited for privilege escalation if proper access control mechanisms are not implemented.
6) Missing access control: There are no access control mechanisms implemented in the contract, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive functions and data.
