The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without initializing it first, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` claims to implement the interface `IERC20`, but it does not define any of the required functions from that interface, which may result in incorrect visibility/ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` checks a condition that involves calling `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2`, which may consume a large amount of gas and result in insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.
