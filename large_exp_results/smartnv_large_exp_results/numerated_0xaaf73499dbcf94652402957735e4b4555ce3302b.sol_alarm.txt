The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) business logic flaw: The contract depends on specific timing conditions for executing proposals, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the timing conditions are not properly handled or manipulated.

2) inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without ensuring that the state updates are consistent and properly handled.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and the ownership of the contract are not clearly defined, which could lead to unexpected access control issues.

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
