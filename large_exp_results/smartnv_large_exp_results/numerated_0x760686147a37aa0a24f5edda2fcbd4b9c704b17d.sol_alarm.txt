The contract below may have the potential vulnerabilities of "incorrect visibility/ownership" and "ID uniqueness violation."

contract PaymentProcessor {
    uint256 public totalPayments;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public payments;

    function processPayment(uint256 paymentId, uint256 amount) external {
        payments[paymentId] = amount;
        totalPayments++;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for uniqueness of the paymentId before storing it in the payments mapping. This could lead to overwriting existing payment amounts or confusion in tracking payments.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The totalPayments variable is public, meaning anyone can read its value. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the total number of payments processed by the contract.
