Potential vulnerabilities in contract <\contract_3\>:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The makePayment function only allows the owner to make payments, but it should use the require statement to restrict who can call the function. This could be exploited for privilege escalation.
2) Missing input validation - There is no input validation for the amount parameter in the makePayment function. This could lead to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
3) No protection against reentrancy - The contract does not have any protection against reentrancy attacks, leaving it vulnerable to this type of exploit.
4) Lack of access control - The owner variable is public, allowing anyone to see the owner of the contract. This could potentially lead to security issues if malicious actors know the owner's identity.
5) Lack of error handling - There are no error handling mechanisms in place, which could result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if exceptions are raised during contract execution.
