The contract provided is as follows:

contract MyContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balance += msg.value;
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
    
    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
    
    function setOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) privilege escalation: The vulnerability arises in the setOwner function, where any user can change the owner of the contract by specifying a new owner address.

3) business logic flaw: The withdraw function does not consider the scenario where the contract's balance could go negative if a user tries to withdraw more than the contract balance.

8) reentrancy: There is a potential vulnerability to reentrancy attacks in the withdraw function where external contracts can call this function and potentially re-enter to manipulate the contract's state.

11) suicidal contracts: The contract does not have a mechanism to prevent self-destructing by calling the selfdestruct function, making it vulnerable to suicide attacks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract "MyContract" are: privilege escalation, business logic flaw, reentrancy, and suicidal contracts.
