The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the state variable `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, which can be manipulated by external factors.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votedProposal` function, which can lead to potential security risks.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the `liquidate()` function can potentially result in integer overflow if the values are manipulated.
4) Atomicity violation: The `calculatePrice()` function relies on external state variables for calculations, which can be changed by other transactions before completion.
5) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `liquidate()` function has a potential flaw in determining if a user's funds can be liquidated.
