Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the proposal without checking for existing proposals, potentially allowing for unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is internal which might cause issues with visibility and ownership control.
3) Insufficient gas: The execution of endExecute relies on the balance of the contract which may exceed the gas limit and result in an out of gas error.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
5) Atomicity violation: The execute function does multiple state changes without using reentrancy guards, which could lead to potential race conditions.
