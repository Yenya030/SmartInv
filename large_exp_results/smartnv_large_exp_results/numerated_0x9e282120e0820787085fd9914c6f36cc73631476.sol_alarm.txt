The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without checking if the proposal has met the conditions for execution. This can lead to an inconsistent state if the execution conditions are not properly verified before updating the state variables.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which can lead to potential access control issues if other contracts or external entities can access or modify this variable unintentionally.
