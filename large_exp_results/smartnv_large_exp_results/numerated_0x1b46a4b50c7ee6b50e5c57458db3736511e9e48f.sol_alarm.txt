Contract you provided has several potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the functions in the contract is not specified (public, external, etc.), making it vulnerable to access control issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The functions 'startExecute' and 'endExecute' modify the state of the contract (proposal struct) without properly ensuring consistency, making it vulnerable to inconsistent state updates.
3) Business logic flaw: The 'endExecute' function checks if 2 times the balance of the contract is greater than the total supply of the voting token to determine execution success, which may not accurately reflect the intended logic.
4) Insufficient gas: The 'execute' function may require more gas than expected due to potential token transfer operations, leading to the risk of running out of gas.
5) Inconsistent arithmetic: The arithmetic operations in the 'liquidate' function may lead to unexpected results if the values of 'cAmount' and 'dAmount' are not properly checked and sanitized.
6) Privilege escalation: The lack of access control in the 'liquidate' function could potentially allow unauthorized users to perform operations on behalf of others. 

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities that may need to be addressed to ensure its security and functionality.
