Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without any validation checks or mechanisms to ensure that the update is consistent with the contract's logic, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract lacks explicit visibility modifiers for its functions, making it prone to unintended access or manipulation by unauthorized parties.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
