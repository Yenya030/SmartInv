The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Lottery {
    address public manager;
    address[] public players;

    constructor() {
        manager = msg.sender;
    }

    function enter() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0.01 ether, "Minimum entry fee is 0.01 ether.");
        players.push(msg.sender);
    }

    function pickWinner() public restricted {
        require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can pick the winner.");
        require(players.length > 0, "No players in the lottery.");

        address winner = players[random() % players.length];
        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);

        players = new address[](0);
    }

    modifier restricted() {
        require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    function random() private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players)));
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Insufficient gas
- Inconsistent state update

Output:
insufficient gas, inconsistent state update
