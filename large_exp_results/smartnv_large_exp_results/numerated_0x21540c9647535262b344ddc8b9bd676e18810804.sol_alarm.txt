The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The execute function can be called multiple times within the 24-hour window, potentially allowing for multiple executions of the same proposal.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal directly without considering the possibility of reentrancy or other potential issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail to complete if the gas limit is reached before the function execution is completed due to the internal computation.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is not specified in the contract, potentially leading to unintended accessibility or modification.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
