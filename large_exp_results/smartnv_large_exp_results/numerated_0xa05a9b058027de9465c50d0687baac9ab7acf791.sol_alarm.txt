Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Business logic flaw: The execute function allows for re-execution of a proposal as it doesn't reset the votedAmount back to 0 after execution.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is incrementing without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which might lead to unexpected behavior or lack of proper access control.
