The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are as follows: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The interface IERC20 is not implemented in the contract which can lead to unforeseen ownership and visibility issues.

2) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper checks or restrictions, which can lead to unexpected state changes.

3) Insufficient gas: If the required gas for certain functions exceeds the gas limit, it can result in a failure of the function execution.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
