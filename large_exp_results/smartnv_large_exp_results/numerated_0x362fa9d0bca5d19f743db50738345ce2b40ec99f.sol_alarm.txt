<\output\> 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership in `itemPrices` and `items` mapping making them publicly accessible. 
- Potential reentrancy vulnerability in `buyItem` function.
- Insufficient gas for performing the operations within the transactions.
- Possible atomicity violation in the `buyItem` function.
