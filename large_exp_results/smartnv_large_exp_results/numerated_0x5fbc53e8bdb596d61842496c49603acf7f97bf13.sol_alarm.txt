The potential vulnerabilities in the contract VotingSystem are:
1) Inconsistent State Update: The update to the proposals array in the vote and delegate functions can lead to inconsistent state if not carefully managed.
2) Integer Overflow/Underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculations involving weights and vote counts, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The visibility of the voters mapping and proposals array can expose sensitive information and potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
4) Privilege Escalation: There is a potential for privilege escalation if the delegate function is not properly secured, allowing unauthorized parties to delegate votes on behalf of others.
