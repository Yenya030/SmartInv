The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    address public wallet;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    uint public totalTokens;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    constructor(IERC20 _token, address _wallet, uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        wallet = _wallet;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
        totalTokens = _totalTokens;
    }
    
    function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
        require(msg.value == (_numTokens * tokenPrice), "Insufficient funds");
        require(_numTokens <= totalTokens, "Not enough tokens available");
        
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _numTokens);
        balances[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
        totalTokens -= _numTokens;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
        
        payable(wallet).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not have explicit checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow during token transfer and balance updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas scenarios, which may result in failed transactions or unpredictable behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions could be manipulated by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access.
4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transfers securely, potentially leading to ether leakage issues.
5) Business logic flaw: The contract's logic for buying tokens and updating balances may have vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
6) Inconsistent state update: The state variables may not be consistently updated in all functions, leading to potential issues with the contract's behavior.
