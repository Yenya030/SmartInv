Contract analysis:

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The code snippet does not update the `proposal` struct's `sTime` when a proposal is started, making it possible for multiple proposals to be started at the same time.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does not perform the state update in a single atomic operation, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function is interrupted midway through execution.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not a public or internal variable, raising concerns about data visibility and ownership control within the contract.
