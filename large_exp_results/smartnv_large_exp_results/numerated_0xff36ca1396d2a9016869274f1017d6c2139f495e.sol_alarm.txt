The contract mentioned in the question seems to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Insufficient gas: The execute function in the contract may require a significant amount of gas due to potential loops and operations, leading to the possibility of running out of gas and failing to complete the execution.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a scenario in the endExecute function where it calculates the lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, which may not accurately reflect the actual locked funds due to potential transactions occurring during the execution of the function.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is not specified, which could lead to potential issues related to ownership and access control within the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are insufficient gas, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
