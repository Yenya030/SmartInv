Potential vulnerabilities:
7) ID uniqueness violation - The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure that each party involved (buyer, seller, arbiter) has a unique identification to prevent impersonation or confusion.
9) Integer overflow/underflow - There are potential risks of integer overflow or underflow in calculations involving balances or transfers of funds.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility of functions and variables should be carefully considered to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the escrow state.
