Contract to analyze:

contract PaymentGateway {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public payments;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function makePayment(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can make payments");
        payments[_to] += _amount;
    }

    function withdrawPayment(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw payments");
        require(payments[_to] >= _amount, "Insufficient funds");
        payments[_to] -= _amount;
        payable(_to).transfer(_amount);
    }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership.
