The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency in the state update for the `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `votingToken` variable is not specified, which could lead to visibility issues and possible unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas consumption of the `execute` function, there could be a risk of running out of gas during the execution, leading to incomplete transactions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
