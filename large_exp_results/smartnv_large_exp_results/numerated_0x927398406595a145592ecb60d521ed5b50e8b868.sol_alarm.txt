Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates as there is no locking mechanism or synchronization technique used to ensure atomicity when updating the state variables.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not define the visibility of the state variables owner, proposal, startingBalanceList, lockedFunds, and votingToken, which could lead to potential issues with ownership and data visibility.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas optimization techniques, which could lead to out-of-gas exceptions during transaction execution.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is a lack of checks for ensuring the uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
