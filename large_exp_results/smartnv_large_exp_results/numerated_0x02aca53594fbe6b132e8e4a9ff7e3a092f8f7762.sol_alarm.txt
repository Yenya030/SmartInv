The contract to analyze:

contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public payments;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function makePayment(uint256 paymentId, uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can make payments");
        payments[paymentId] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 paymentId) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        uint256 amount = payments[paymentId];
        require(amount > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
        payments[paymentId] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Output: 
This contract seems healthy and does not contain any potential vulnerabilities.
