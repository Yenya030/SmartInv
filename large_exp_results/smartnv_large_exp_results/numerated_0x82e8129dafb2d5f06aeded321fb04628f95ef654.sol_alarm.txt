The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership as the contract TimelockController does not specify the visibility (public, external, internal, private) for its functions and variables. 
2) ID uniqueness violation as there is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals.
3) Inconsistent state update as the variable "lockedFunds" in the endExecute function is updated without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
