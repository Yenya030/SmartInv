Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which may lead to confusion or unintended behavior if multiple proposals have the same ID.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the endExecute function, the requirement check for execution failed relies on comparing the balance of the contract with twice the total supply of the voting token. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance changes unexpectedly during the execution of this function.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function includes a check that verifies if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply of the voting token. This calculation could potentially require a large amount of gas to execute, leading to insufficient gas error during the function execution.
