Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is referenced in the `setTokenPrice` function without being defined or initialized, potentially leading to an ownership vulnerability.
2) Insufficient gas: If `buyTokens` function requires a significant amount of gas to be executed, there might be a risk of running out of gas and the transaction failing.
3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, which might result in Ether leakage if any is sent to the contract accidentally.
