The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract uses the `internal` visibility modifier for the `owner` variable, which could potentially lead to issues related to ownership and access control.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct variables are being directly modified in the functions without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function transfers tokens without specifying gas limits, which could lead to potential out of gas errors.
4) Arithmetic flaw: In the `endExecute` function, the comparison `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` could potentially result in an arithmetic flaw if the values are large, leading to unexpected behavior.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are no checks in place to prevent integer overflow/underflow in the calculations involving token amounts in the functions, which could lead to vulnerabilities.
6) Ether leakage: The contract interacts with Ether in the form of token transfers but does not handle Ether transfers securely, potentially leading to Ether leakage vulnerabilities.
