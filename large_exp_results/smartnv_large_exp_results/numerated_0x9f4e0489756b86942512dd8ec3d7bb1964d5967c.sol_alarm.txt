Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas limits for its functions, which could lead to out-of-gas errors or potential denial of service attacks.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables should be carefully set to ensure proper access control and prevent unauthorized manipulation of data or functionality.
