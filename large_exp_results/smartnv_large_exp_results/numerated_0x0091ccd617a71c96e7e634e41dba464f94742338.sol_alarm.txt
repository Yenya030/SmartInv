The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any protection against reentrancy, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
