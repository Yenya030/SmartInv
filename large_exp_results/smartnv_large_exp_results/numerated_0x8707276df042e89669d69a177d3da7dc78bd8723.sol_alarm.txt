The contract provided for analysis is:

contract VotingSystem {
     struct Voter {
           uint256 votedProposalID;
           bool hasVoted;
           bool isAdmin; 
           }
     mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
     mapping(uint256 => uint256) public proposalResults;
     uint256 public totalVoters;

     function vote(uint256 proposalID) external {
           require(voters[msg.sender].hasVoted == false, "Already voted");
           require(voters[msg.sender].isAdmin == false, "Admin cannot vote");
           voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = true;
           voters[msg.sender].votedProposalID = proposalID;
           proposalResults[proposalID]++;
           totalVoters++;
      }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- privilege escalation: The isAdmin flag is not being properly managed and can lead to unauthorized privilege escalation.
- inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state updates in the totalVoters count and proposalResults mapping.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or inaccuracies in the proposalResults mapping.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of voter information and the lack of ownership controls can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of voter data.
