This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not specify an access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to only authorized users or roles, potentially allowing unauthorized users to call privileged functions.

2) inconsistent state update: In the function endExecute(), the calculation for lockedFunds is based on the balance of the contract at the time of the function call. If there are concurrent calls or state changes happening, this calculation may not reflect the accurate locked funds.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly define the visibility of variables and functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. Ownership control is also not explicitly implemented, allowing anyone to interact with the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
