Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the proposal state variables without taking measures to ensure atomicity, which could result in inconsistent state updates in case of reentrancy or other issues.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail to complete if the gas provided is not enough to execute all the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the variables and functions, potentially leading to issues related to access control and ownership.
