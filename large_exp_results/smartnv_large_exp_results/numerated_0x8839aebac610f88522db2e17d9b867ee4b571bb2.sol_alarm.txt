Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The function `endExecute` checks if the execution has completed by comparing the total balance in the contract with twice the total supply of the voting token, which may not necessarily indicate a successful execution.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the IERC20 interface, but the functions from the interface are not implemented. This could lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect these functions to be present.
