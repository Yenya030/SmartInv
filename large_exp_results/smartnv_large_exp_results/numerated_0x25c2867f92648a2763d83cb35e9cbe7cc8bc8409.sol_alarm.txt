Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate may potentially lead to inconsistent state update as it updates debt and collateral mappings without proper checks or validations.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the require statement within the liquidate function may be susceptible to arithmetic flaws if not handled correctly.

3) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function may potentially be manipulated for price calculation inaccuracies or exploitation.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like WETH, USDC, pair, debt, and collateral may not be secure or appropriate for the intended functionality of the contract. Ownership of functions and variables should be carefully considered to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.
