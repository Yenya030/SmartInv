The contract provided is as follows:

contract TokenSale {
     address public owner;
     address public token;
     address public wallet;

     uint public tokenPrice;

     mapping(address => uint) balances;

     constructor(address _token, address _wallet, uint _tokenPrice) {
          owner = msg.sender;
          token = _token;
          wallet = _wallet;
          tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint amount) public payable {
          require(msg.value == amount*tokenPrice, "Incorrect amount sent");
          balances[msg.sender] += amount;
          token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
          wallet.transfer(msg.value);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Price manipulation: The tokenPrice is set by the owner during contract deployment and could potentially be manipulated by the owner.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check for potential integer overflow in the calculation of msg.value == amount*tokenPrice.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which may expose sensitive information. It is recommended to use internal or private visibility for this variable.
