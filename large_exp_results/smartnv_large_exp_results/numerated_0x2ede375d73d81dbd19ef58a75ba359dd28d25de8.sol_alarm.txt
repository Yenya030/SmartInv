The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility: The functions `votedProposal` and `getStartingBalance` are not defined in the contract, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership vulnerabilities.

2) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the function `endExecute` without checking if the conditions for updating it are properly validated, which could lead to inconsistent state updates. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: 1) incorrect visibility/ownership and 2) inconsistent state update.
