The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering if it should only be updated once. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is internal, which may not provide the intended level of access control or visibility.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
