The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` variable, making it publicly accessible.

2) Atomicity Violation: The `execute` function does not ensure that the state updates are atomic, allowing for potential inconsistencies.

3) Inconsistent State Update: The `execute` function updates `proposal.votedAmount` without considering potential reentrancy issues or double counting.

4) Insufficient Gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas provided is not enough to execute the required operations.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
