Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, `lockedFunds` are not specified with any visibility keywords, which could lead to potential security risks.
- Integer underflow: In the `endExecute` function, there is a risk of integer underflow in the expression `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, as the balance of the contract could potentially decrease below zero.
- Insufficient gas: The `execute` and `endExecute` functions involve token transfers which could potentially require a significant amount of gas, leading to insufficient gas errors during execution.
- Inconsistent state update: The values of `proposal.votedAmount` and `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` are updated without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
