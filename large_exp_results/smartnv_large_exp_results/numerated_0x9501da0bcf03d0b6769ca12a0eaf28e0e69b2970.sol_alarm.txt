The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows: 

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not explicitly define access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute functions they should not have access to.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables without properly checking for consistency or ensuring that the state transitions are valid, which could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of some state variables and functions, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external actors. Additionally, the ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, potentially leading to issues with control and authorization.
