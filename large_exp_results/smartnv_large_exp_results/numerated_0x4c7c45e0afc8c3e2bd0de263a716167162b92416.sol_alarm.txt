contract VotingSystem {

     function vote() public {
         require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "you have already voted");
         totalVotes++;
         hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
     }

Potential vulnerabilities: 
7) ID uniqueness violation - There is no verification in place to ensure that the same address cannot vote multiple times or revoke a vote that hasn't been cast.
11) Suicidal contracts - The contract does not prevent someone from revoking their vote, which may lead to inconsistent or unintended outcomes in the voting system.
