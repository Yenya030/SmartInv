The contract to be analyzed:

contract SupplyChain {
        struct Product {
            uint id;
            string name;
            uint price;
        }
        
        mapping(uint => Product) public products;
        uint public productCount;
        
        function addProduct(string memory _name, uint _price) public {
            productCount++;
            products[productCount] = Product(productCount, _name, _price);
        }
        
        function updateProduct(uint _id, string memory _name, uint _price) public {
            require(_id <= productCount && _id > 0, "Invalid product ID");
            products[_id].name = _name;
            products[_id].price = _price;
        }
}

Output:
- inconsistent state update: The productCount is incremented before adding a product, which may result in skipping IDs or other issues.
- ID uniqueness violation: The productCount is used as an ID for products, which may lead to overlapping IDs or conflicts.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The products mapping is public, allowing anyone to access and modify product information directly.
