The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update:
- The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList`, but there is no specific order in which these updates are performed. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state if the order of execution is not controlled.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract implements the interface `IERC20`, but it is unclear if all the required functions of the interface are implemented correctly. This can lead to issues with visibility and ownership of functions within the contract.
