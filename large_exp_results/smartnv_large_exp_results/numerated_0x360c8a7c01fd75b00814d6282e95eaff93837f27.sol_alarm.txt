Contract to analyze:

contract SmartContract {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the SmartContract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (The owner is not properly restricted in functions)
- Inconsistent state update (The state of balances is directly updated without proper checks and balances)
- Insufficient gas (Possible lack of gas stipend for transfer function)
- Potential reentrancy vulnerability
