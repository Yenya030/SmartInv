Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mapping directly without considering the implications of the changes. This could result in inconsistent state if the update is not performed correctly.
- Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract uses a calculation based on the getPrice() function that may not accurately reflect the actual collateral and debt relationship. This could lead to incorrect liquidation decisions.
- Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract calculates the price based on the balance of USDC and WETH in the pair contract. This could be manipulated to provide incorrect pricing information.
