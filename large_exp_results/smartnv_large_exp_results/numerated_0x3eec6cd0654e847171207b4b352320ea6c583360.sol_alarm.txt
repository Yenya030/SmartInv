The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for the state variables and functions, potentially exposing them to unauthorized access.

2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal" struct is being directly modified in multiple functions without proper checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may require a significant amount of gas to execute if the condition for execution failed is met, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple instances where arithmetic operations are performed on uint variables without proper checks for potential overflow or underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior.

5) Privilege escalation: The use of the "owner" address without proper access control mechanisms may lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the contract.
