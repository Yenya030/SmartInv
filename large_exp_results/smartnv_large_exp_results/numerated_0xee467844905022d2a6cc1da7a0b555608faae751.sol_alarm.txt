Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without any proper synchronization mechanism, which might lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple operations involving arithmetic calculations in the contract, such as checking if the "cAmount" is less than 80% of the result of getPrice() * cAmount, which could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow issues.
- Insufficient gas: The contract might encounter out-of-gas issues due to the lack of gas optimization in functions that involve token transfers like "transferFrom".
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the owner variable is properly managed and if the visibility of certain functions or variables is appropriate to ensure proper access control and ownership.
