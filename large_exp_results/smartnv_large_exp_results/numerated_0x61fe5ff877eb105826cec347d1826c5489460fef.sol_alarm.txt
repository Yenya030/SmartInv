The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state but does not check if a proposal is already in progress, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract defines the interface `IERC20` but does not provide the implementation for it, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions but uses the `transferFrom` function, which could lead to ether leakage vulnerabilities if Ether is accidentally sent to the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and ether leakage.
