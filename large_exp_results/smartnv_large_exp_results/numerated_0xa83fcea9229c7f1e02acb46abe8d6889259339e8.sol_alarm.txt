This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` in separate steps, which could lead to inconsistent state if one update fails or is reverted.

2) insufficient gas: If the `execute` function requires a significant amount of gas to complete the `votingToken.transferFrom` and `votedProposal` operations, there might be a risk of running out of gas and failing the execution.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `proposal` and `votingToken` is not specified, which could potentially lead to accessibility or ownership issues if they are intended to be private or restricted.

Overall, the contract may need further auditing and modifications to address these potential vulnerabilities.
