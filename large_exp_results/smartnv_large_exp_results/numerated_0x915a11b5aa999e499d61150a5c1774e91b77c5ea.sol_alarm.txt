The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Xchange {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function trade(uint amountA, uint amountB) external {
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle the possibility of one transfer succeeding while the other fails, leading to an inconsistent state if one transfer is completed and the other fails.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions in the contract are externally accessible, which may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functions or data by external parties. 

The contract marked as healthy.
