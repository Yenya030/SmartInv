Contract:
```
contract PaymentContract {
    mapping(address => uint) public payments;
    uint public totalPayments;
    
    function makePayment(address recipient, uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid payment amount");
        payments[recipient] += amount;
        totalPayments += amount;
    }
    
    function withdrawPayment(address recipient) public {
        require(payments[recipient] > 0, "No funds to withdraw");
        uint amount = payments[recipient];
        totalPayments -= amount;
        payments[recipient] = 0;
        (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
    
    function getTotalPayments() public view returns (uint) {
        return totalPayments;
    }
}
```

Output:
The contract does not contain any potential vulnerabilities. It is healthy.
