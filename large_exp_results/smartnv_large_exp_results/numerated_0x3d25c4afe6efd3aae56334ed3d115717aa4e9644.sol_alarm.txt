The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without checking for existing proposals or ensuring atomicity in updating the state variables.
2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() modifies the votedAmount of the proposal without using any locking mechanism to ensure atomicity of the update.
3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may run out of gas due to the potential loop in the require statement, which could prevent the execution of the function and cause a denial-of-service vulnerability.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and insufficient gas.
