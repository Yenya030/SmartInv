Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the state variable "proposal.votedAmount" without checking if the token transfer was successful. This could result in an inconsistent state if the transfer fails after the state update.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20, which may not be intended and could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may result in running out of gas if the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" is not efficiently implemented and consumes too much gas.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to check for the uniqueness of proposal addresses, which could lead to ID duplication issues.
5) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract seem to perform multiple operations that should be executed atomically, potentially leading to inconsistent states if not properly managed.
