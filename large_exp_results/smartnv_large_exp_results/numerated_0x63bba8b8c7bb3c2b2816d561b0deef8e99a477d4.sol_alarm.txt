Potential vulnerabilities:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseToSeller and refundToBuyer functions are only restricted to the arbiter, but it might be better to have additional checks to ensure that only the arbiter can call these functions.
- inconsistent state update: There is no update or check on the state of the contract after a transfer is made, which could lead to inconsistent states if the transfer fails.
- ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure that each party (buyer, seller, arbiter) has a unique address, which could lead to confusion or disputes.
