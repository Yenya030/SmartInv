The contract provided for analysis is: 

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        uint cost = _amount * tokenPrice;
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cost, "Insufficient balance");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, cost);
        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

3) business logic flaw: The `buyTokens` function may have a business logic flaw regarding the calculation of the cost in tokens, as it multiplies the amount by the token price without proper consideration of decimal points or potential rounding issues.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `balances` mapping has a public visibility, which exposes the balances of all addresses, potentially compromising user privacy and security. Moreover, the `owner` variable is publicly accessible, which may not be intended and can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are a business logic flaw and an issue with incorrect visibility/ownership.
