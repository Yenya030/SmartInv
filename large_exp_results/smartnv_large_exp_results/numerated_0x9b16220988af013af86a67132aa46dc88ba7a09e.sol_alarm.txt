Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility modifier for the functions, making them public by default. This can lead to potential security risks if sensitive functions are inadvertently made public.
- Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state of the proposal without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: The endExecute function relies on gas availability to complete the execution, which may result in failed executions if there is insufficient gas.
- Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate function performs arithmetic calculations without considering potential integer overflows/underflows, which can result in unexpected behavior.
