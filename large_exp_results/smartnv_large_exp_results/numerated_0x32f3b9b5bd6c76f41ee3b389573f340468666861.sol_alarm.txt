The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Integer Overflow/Underflow: 
- In the function `endExecute()`, there is a risk of integer overflow if the total supply of `votingToken` exceeds half the range of uint256 due to the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");`. 

2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: 
- The ` owner` variable is declared as internal, which might not provide the desired level of visibility for handling ownership within the contract. 

3) Inconsistent State Update:
- In the function `startExecute()`, the `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` is assigned without initializing it, potentially causing inconsistencies in the state data. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are Integer Overflow/Underflow, Incorrect Visibility/Ownership, and Inconsistent State Update.
