The contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
         struct Voter {
             address addr;
             uint256 vote;
         }
         mapping(address => bool) public voted;
         mapping(address => uint256) public votes;
         Voter[] public voters;
         
         function vote(uint256 choice) public {
             require(choice == 0 || choice == 1, "invalid choice");
             require(voted[msg.sender] == false, "you have already voted");
             
             voters.push(Voter(msg.sender, choice));
             voted[msg.sender] = true;
             votes[choice]++;
         }
         
         function getWinner() public view returns (uint256) {
             if (votes[0] > votes[1]) {
                 return 0;
             } else {
                 return 1;
             }
         }
     }

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `voted` and `votes` are public, making them accessible to anyone, potentially leading to unauthorized manipulation of voting results.
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique voter addresses, which could allow for multiple votes from the same address or fake addresses.
- Business logic flaw: The `getWinner` function does not handle ties, potentially leading to inaccurate determination of the winning choice.
