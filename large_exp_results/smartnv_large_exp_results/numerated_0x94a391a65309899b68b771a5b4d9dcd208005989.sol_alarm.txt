The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for its functions. This can lead to potential security risks if unintended users or contracts have access to execute functions.
- Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function, but there is no check to ensure proper synchronization or validation of the state before it is updated. This can lead to inconsistent data states within the contract.
- Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total supply of tokens, which can consume a significant amount of gas if the balances are large. This can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
2) inconsistent state update
3) insufficient gas
