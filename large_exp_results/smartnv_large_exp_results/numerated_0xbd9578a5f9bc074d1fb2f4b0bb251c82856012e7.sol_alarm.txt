Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without checking if the conditions for the execution are correct.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal()` function is called without specifying the visibility of the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior or manipulation.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the `calculatePrice()` function if the values become too large during calculation.
