Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce proper permissions for critical functions, allowing unauthorized users to start, execute, and end proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are instances where the state variables like proposal and startingBalanceList are being updated without proper synchronization or validation.
3) Arithmetic flaw: There are operations like proposal.votedAmount += amount that could potentially result in integer overflow if not handled properly.
4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, potentially leading to Ether leakage.
5) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract might require more gas than the default gas limit, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
