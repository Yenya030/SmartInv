The contract below has potential vulnerabilities:

<\contract\>
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;

    function setArbiter(address _arbiter) external {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "only buyer or seller can set arbiter");
        arbiter = _arbiter;
    }

    function releaseFunds() external {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "only arbiter can release funds");
        // code to release funds
    }
}
<\contract\>

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: Lack of access control for setting the arbiter, as anyone can set the arbiter.
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: Lack of proper access control for releasing funds, as anyone can release funds if they know the arbiter's address.
