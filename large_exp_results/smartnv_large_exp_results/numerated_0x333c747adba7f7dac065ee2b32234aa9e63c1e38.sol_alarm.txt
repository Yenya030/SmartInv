The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, but this balance is not used or checked anywhere else in the contract.
2) Business logic flaw: The requirement in the endExecute function that checks if the locked funds are greater than half of the total supply might lead to unexpected outcomes as it is not standard practice for timelock controllers.
