Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) privilege escalation:
- The contract uses an internal owner address which may lead to privilege escalation if ownership control is not properly managed.

2) inconsistent state update:
- The `proposal` state is updated in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) atomicity violation:
- There are multiple state updates happening in the `execute` function without being wrapped in a single transaction, which could lead to atomicity violation.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The visibility of variables and functions such as `votingToken`, `votedProposal`, `lockedFunds` are not specified, potentially leading to incorrect visibility.
