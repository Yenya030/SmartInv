The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities as follows: 

1) atomicity violation: The requirements and operations within the functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() can be separated by external actions, leading to incomplete updates.
2) inconsistent state update: The execution of transferFrom() in the execute() function can lead to inconsistent state updates if it fails after the proposal.votedAmount += amount statement.  
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership modifiers for its functions. 
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce ID uniqueness for proposals, which could lead to potential conflicts or errors.
