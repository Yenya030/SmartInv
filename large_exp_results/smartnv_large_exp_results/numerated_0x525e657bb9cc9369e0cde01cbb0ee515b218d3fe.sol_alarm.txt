The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without resetting the proposal state, which may lead to inconsistent data within the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify access modifiers like `public` or `external` for the state variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, and `startingBalanceList`, potentially leading to incorrect access control or visibility issues.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are no explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow in functions like `execute()` where the `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented, which can potentially result in unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

4) Insufficient gas: The `execute()` function performs a `transferFrom` operation which involves external calls and may require additional gas. If insufficient gas is provided by the caller, the transaction may fail, leading to the loss of transaction fees.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, integer overflow/underflow, and insufficient gas.
