The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: Proposal struct is being updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is internal which may not provide the intended access control.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute due to insufficient gas if the provided condition is not met.
