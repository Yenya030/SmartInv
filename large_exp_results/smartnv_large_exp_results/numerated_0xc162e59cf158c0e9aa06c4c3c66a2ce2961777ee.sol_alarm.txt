The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the contract ExchangeTokens may have a business logic flaw as the condition for liquidation might not accurately assess the user's fund situation.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have an arithmetic flaw as it is dividing balances without proper validation or handling of possible division by zero errors.
