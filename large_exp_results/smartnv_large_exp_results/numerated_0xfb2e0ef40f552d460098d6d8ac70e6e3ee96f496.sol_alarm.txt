The following contract may have the potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update:
   - The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state, but the `proposal` variable is not declared within the function, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if it's not properly initialized.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility if it was intended to be public or private.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - There is a lack of gas checks in the functions, which may lead to potential out-of-gas errors when executing certain operations on the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
