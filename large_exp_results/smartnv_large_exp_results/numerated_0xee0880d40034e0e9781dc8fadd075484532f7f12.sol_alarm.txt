Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Insufficient gas: There is a potential for insufficient gas in functions like `execute()` and `endExecute()` as they involve transferring tokens which might consume more gas than expected.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal which might lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.

3) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the `execute()` function where the `votedAmount` is being updated without using a locking mechanism, potentially leading to race conditions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposals' identifiers (`sTime` in this case), which could lead to conflicts or issues with multiple proposals having the same identifier.

5) Arithmetic flaw: There might be potential arithmetic flaws in the calculation of starting balance in `startExecute()` and the check in `endExecute()` where the balance is compared to the total supply without considering potential overflow or underflow.

6) Ether leakage: There is no mechanism in place to handle ether leakage or ensure proper handling of Ether transactions within the contract.

7) Inconsistent state update: There might be inconsistencies in the state updates of the `proposal` struct and other variables like `startingBalanceList` without proper synchronization or validation mechanisms.

8) Privilege escalation: There is a potential for privilege escalation issues, especially with the `owner` variable and its role in the contract functionality.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, ID uniqueness violation, arithmetic flaw, ether leakage, inconsistent state update, and privilege escalation.
