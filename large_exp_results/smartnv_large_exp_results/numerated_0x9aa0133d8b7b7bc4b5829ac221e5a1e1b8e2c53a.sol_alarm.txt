Potential vulnerabilities in the TimelockController contract:
1) Inconsistent state update - The Proposal struct is being used without being initialized in the startExecute function, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Business logic flaw - The execute function allows for transfer of tokens without proper verification of the proposal status, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is defined as internal which may expose sensitive information and potentially lead to authorization issues.
