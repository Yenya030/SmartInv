Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function based on the balance of the contract, but it does not consider the total supply of the voting token in the calculation. This may lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes while the function is executing.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not implement all the necessary functions. It also declares an internal owner variable but does not define any specific ownership control mechanism, which could lead to potential ownership vulnerabilities.
