Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is called in the `execute` function without being defined in the contract or inherited interfaces. This could lead to issues with visibility and ownership.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to prevent multiple calls to the function within the same block, potentially leading to an incorrect state update.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function executes multiple checks and updates the state, which could consume a significant amount of gas. If the gas limit is reached during this function's execution, it could lead to incomplete or failed execution.

4) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes happening in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions without using any locking mechanism to ensure atomicity. This could lead to inconsistent states if multiple transactions try to modify the state simultaneously.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not contain a unique identifier field. Without a unique ID, it may be challenging to differentiate between different proposals or track their status accurately.
