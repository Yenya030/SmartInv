The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state variable `proposal`, but does not utilize any locking mechanism to prevent race conditions.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract declares to implement the `IERC20` interface but does not provide any implementation for the required functions.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` might fail due to running out of gas if the loop for checking the balance of the contract requires too much gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
