The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is as follows:

contract VotingSystem {
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public userVotes;

    function vote(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Cannot vote with zero amount");
        totalVotes += amount;
        userVotes[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function redeemVotes() external {
        uint256 userVote = userVotes[msg.sender];
        require(userVote > 0, "No votes to redeem");
    
        msg.sender.transfer(userVote);
        totalVotes -= userVote;
        userVotes[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the VotingSystem contract are:
- insufficient gas
- incorrect visibility/ownership
