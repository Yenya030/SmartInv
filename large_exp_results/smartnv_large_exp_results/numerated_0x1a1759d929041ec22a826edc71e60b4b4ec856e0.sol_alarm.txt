The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function without proper validation or checks, which could lead to incorrect state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function performs a gas-intensive operation by checking if twice the balance of the contract is greater than the total token supply, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as internal, which might lead to potential visibility issues or concerns regarding the ownership of the contract.
