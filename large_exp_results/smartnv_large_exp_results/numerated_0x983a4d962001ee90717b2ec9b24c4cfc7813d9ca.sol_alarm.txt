The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The visibility of the `votingToken` variable is not specified, which can lead to potential issues with accessibility and ownership control. 

2) Inconsistent state update:
- In the `execute` function, the `votedProposal` function is called after updating the `proposal.votedAmount`, which can lead to inconsistent state updates. 

3) Insufficient gas:
- The `endExecute` function might require a large amount of gas if the `votingToken.totalSupply()` is large, potentially leading to insufficient gas error during execution.
