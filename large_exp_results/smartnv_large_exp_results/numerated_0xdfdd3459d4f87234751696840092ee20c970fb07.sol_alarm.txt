The contract you provided is as follows:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 
        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 
        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'startExecute' function updates the 'proposal' state without initializing it first.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'execute' function updates the 'proposal.votedAmount' without proper validation or synchronization.
3) Business logic flaw: The condition in 'endExecute' for checking if execution failed based on total token supply might not accurately reflect the state of the system.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is not specified with any visibility, potentially allowing unintended access or manipulation.
