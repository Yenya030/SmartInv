Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential vulnerability in the endExecute() function where the lockedFunds variable is updated based on the balance of the contract at that moment. This can lead to inconsistent state updates as the contract balance can change between the check and the update.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is internal, which may restrict access to this variable in certain circumstances. Consider updating the visibility to public or adding getter/setter functions to ensure proper ownership control.
