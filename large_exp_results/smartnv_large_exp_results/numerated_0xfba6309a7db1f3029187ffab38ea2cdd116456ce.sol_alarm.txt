Contract to be analyzed: 

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    uint public price;
    uint public startTime;
    bool public isPaid;
    
    modifier onlyBuyer() {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "You are not the buyer");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier onlySeller() {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "You are not the seller");
        _;
    }

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, uint _price) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        price = _price;
        startTime = block.timestamp;
        isPaid = false;
    }
    
    function deposit() public payable onlyBuyer {
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect deposit amount");
        isPaid = true;
    }
    
    function releasePayment() public onlySeller {
        require(isPaid == true, "Payment has not been made");
        payable(seller).transfer(price);
    }
    
    function refundPayment() public onlyBuyer {
        require(isPaid == true, "Payment has not been made");
        payable(buyer).transfer(price);
    }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not enforce proper visibility and access control for certain functions which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract's state and funds.
