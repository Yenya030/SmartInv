Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals. This could potentially lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which might not be the intended visibility level for ownership within the contract. This could lead to issues with access control.
3) Insufficient gas: If the contract performs complex operations or interactions that require a large amount of gas, there is a possibility of running out of gas during execution, leading to failed transactions.
4) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state updates as multiple functions manipulate the state variables without proper synchronization or checks.
5) Arithmetic flaw: The use of arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication without proper bounds checking or overflow/underflow protection could lead to vulnerabilities.
