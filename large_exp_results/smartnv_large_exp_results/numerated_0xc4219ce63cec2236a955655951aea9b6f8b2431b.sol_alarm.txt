The contract to analyze:

contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public payee;
    uint public amount;

    function deposit(address _payee) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can deposit");
        payee = _payee;
        amount = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == payee, "Only payee can withdraw");
        payee.transfer(amount);
        amount = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
