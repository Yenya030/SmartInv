The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - In the function `startExecute()`, the starting balance update for `proposal.addr` using `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance;` is not consistent and could lead to unexpected behavior.

2) ID uniqueness violation:
   - There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposals, which could lead to issues when multiple proposals are created simultaneously.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The visibility of `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed for improved security.
