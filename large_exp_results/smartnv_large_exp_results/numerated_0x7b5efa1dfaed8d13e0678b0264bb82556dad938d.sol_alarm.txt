The contract provided above contains potential vulnerabilities: 
- Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` based on the balance of tokens held by the contract. However, the calculation to check if execution has failed (`require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) does not take into account the updated balance after the `transferFrom` in the `execute` function, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not define the required functions, leading to potential issues with visibility and ownership of token functions. 

So, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
