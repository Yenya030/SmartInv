The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the token. 
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without checking if the transaction is successful, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if the token transfer fails. 
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function relies on the contract having enough gas to execute all the required operations within one block, which can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors and failed executions.
