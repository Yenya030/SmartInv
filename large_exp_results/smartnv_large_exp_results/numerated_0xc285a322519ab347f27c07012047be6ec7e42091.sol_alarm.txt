Potential vulnerabilities in EscrowContract:
- incorrect visibility/ownership (refund function can be called by anyone)
- inconsistent state update (no check for whether tokens are actually transferred before updating state)
- insufficient gas (if transferring tokens consumes a lot of gas, refund function may not complete successfully)
