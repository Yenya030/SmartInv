The contract you provided is as follows:

contract TokenSale {
    address public seller;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public price;

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        seller.transfer(msg.value);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state update of transferring the token and transferring the ether to the seller is not done atomically, which may result in an inconsistent state if one of the transfers fails.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The seller address can be accessed publicly, which may expose sensitive information.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for overflow in the calculation of msg.value == amount * price if the price is very large.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and integer overflow/underflow.
