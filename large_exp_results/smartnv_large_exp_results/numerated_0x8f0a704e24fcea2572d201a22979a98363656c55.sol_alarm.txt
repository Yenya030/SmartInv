Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the liquidate function where the calculation for debt and collateral amounts are made.

2) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function may be vulnerable to price manipulation if the balances of USDC and WETH are manipulated externally.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the debt and collateral mappings is set to public, which may expose sensitive information and lead to unauthorized access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are integer overflow/underflow, price manipulation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
