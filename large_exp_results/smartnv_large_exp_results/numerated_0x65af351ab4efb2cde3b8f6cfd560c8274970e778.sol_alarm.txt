The contract provided below may contain potential vulnerabilities:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;
    bool public buyerOk;
    bool public sellerOk;

    function Escrow(address _seller, address _arbiter) public {
        buyer = msg.sender;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = msg.value;
    }

    function confirmPayment() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer);
        buyerOk = true;
    }

    function confirmReceived() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller);
        sellerOk = true;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(!buyerOk && !sellerOk);
        require(msg.sender == arbiter);
        arbiter.transfer(amount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract above are:
- Incorrect visibility in buyerOk and sellerOk variables, which could lead to privilege escalation
- Lack of validation checks in the refund function, making it vulnerable to inconsistent state updates
- Lack of protection against reentrancy in refund function
- Lack of gas stipend in the refund function, causing potential out-of-gas issues.
