The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) privilege escalation - The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions.
2) inconsistent state update - The execute function updates the votedAmount in the Proposal struct, but there is no check to prevent multiple executions of the same proposal, leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define the required functions, potentially causing issues with visibility and ownership.
