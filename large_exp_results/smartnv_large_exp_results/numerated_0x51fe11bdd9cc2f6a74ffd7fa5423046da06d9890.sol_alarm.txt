Contract you are going to analyze:
```solidity
contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than highest bid");
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            address previousBidder = highestBidder;
            highestBidder = msg.sender;
            highestBid = amount;
            previousBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        } else {
            highestBidder = msg.sender;
            highestBid = amount;
        }
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Reentrancy
2) Consistent state update
