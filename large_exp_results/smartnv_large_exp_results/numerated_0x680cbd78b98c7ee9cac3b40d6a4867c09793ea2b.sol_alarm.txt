Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

3) business logic flaw: The liquidation function in the contract may have a business logic flaw as it does not take into account all possible scenarios or edge cases that could lead to unexpected behavior.

6) cross bridge inconsistency: The contract involves token exchange functionality which could potentially result in cross-bridge inconsistency if not properly handled.

8) reentrancy: The contract may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks if external calls are made within critical functions without proper checks and safeguards.

11) suicidal contracts: The contract does not include any protection against the possibility of self-destructing, which could lead to the loss of all funds and data stored in the contract.

13) insufficient gas: The contract may face issues related to gas usage and insufficient gas allocation for certain functions, potentially leading to failed transactions or vulnerabilities.
