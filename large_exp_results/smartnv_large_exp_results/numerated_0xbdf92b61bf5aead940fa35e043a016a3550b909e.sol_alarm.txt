This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of proper synchronization in updating the state variables 'proposal.sTime' and 'proposal.votedAmount' in the 'execute' function. This could lead to unintended behavior or exploitation.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is declared as internal, which means it can be accessed by inheriting contracts. Depending on the contract design, this could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the voting token.

3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may fail if there is not enough gas provided to execute all the required operations. This could result in incomplete or failed execution of the function. 

Therefore, this contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
