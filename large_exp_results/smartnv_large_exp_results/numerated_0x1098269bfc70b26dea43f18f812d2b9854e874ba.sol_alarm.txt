Given the contract provided for analysis:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
    }
    address  internal owner;
    IERC20 votingToken;
    mapping(address => uint) public startingBalanceList;
    Proposal public proposal;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

    }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

    }

    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startingBalance` variable is spelled differently in the `startExecute` function compared to the `startingBalanceList` mapping declaration.

2) Incorrect visibility: The `proposal` struct and `votingToken` variables are declared as `internal`, which may not be intended and could lead to issues with visibility.

3) Potential business logic flaw: Depending on the context, the logic around executing a proposal and ending execution may need more thorough examination to ensure it is correctly implemented.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility, and potential business logic flaw.
