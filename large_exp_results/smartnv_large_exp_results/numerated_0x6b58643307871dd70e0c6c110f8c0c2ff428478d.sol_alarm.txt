Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() sets the proposal without checking if there is an ongoing proposal, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function does not use any synchronization mechanism to ensure atomicity of the operations, which could lead to concurrency issues.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas cost of executing the functions and the available gas provided, there might be instances where the contract runs out of gas before completing the desired actions.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is unclear who has ownership over certain functions and data in the contract, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
