Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract doesn't have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated across different functions, which might result in inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract doesn't explicitly define the visibility of functions or specify ownership control, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract state.
