Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract: 

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in the functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() without ensuring that the updates are done in a consistent and secure manner.
2) Reentrancy: The contract uses the transfer function within the execute() function without any check for reentrancy attacks, which can result in vulnerabilities.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define all the required functions, which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility or ownership vulnerabilities.
4) Business logic flaw: There are potential flaws in the business logic as there are conditions like "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" that might not align with the intended functionality of the contract.
