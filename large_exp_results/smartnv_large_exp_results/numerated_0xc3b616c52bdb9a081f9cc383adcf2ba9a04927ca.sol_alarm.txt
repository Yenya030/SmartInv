Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `startingBalanceList` mapping without initializing it, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility for this variable.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function checks the balance of the contract, which may require a large amount of gas if the token has a high total supply, leading to potential out of gas errors.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
