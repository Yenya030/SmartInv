The contract provided is:

```
contract Escrow {
    address public owner;
    mapping (address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Reentrancy: The `withdraw` and `transfer` functions, when interacting with external contracts, could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks if the recipient contract calls back to the `Escrow` contract before the state changes are finalized.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which exposes ownership information publicly. It's a good practice to keep sensitive data private.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas cost of operations within functions like `withdraw` and `transfer`, there may be a risk of running out of gas during the execution, causing the transaction to fail.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not have explicit checks for integer overflow or underflow, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the balances reach extreme values.

5) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `balances` are updated directly without proper validation or synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple interactions happen concurrently.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: reentrancy, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, integer overflow/underflow, and inconsistent state update.
