The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities in the following areas:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the state variable `lockedFunds` without proper validation or synchronization.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables `WETH`, `USDC`, and `pair` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract are declared as public, which could lead to potential security risks if accessed by unauthorized parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
