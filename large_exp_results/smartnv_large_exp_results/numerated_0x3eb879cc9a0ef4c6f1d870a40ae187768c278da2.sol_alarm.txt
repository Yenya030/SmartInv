The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) privilege escalation: The `changeAdmin` function allows admin privileges to be changed by anyone, not just the current admin.

2) inconsistent state update: The `deposit` and `withdraw` functions directly update `totalBalance`, which could lead to inconsistencies if multiple transactions are processed concurrently.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: There is no restriction on who can call the `getBalance` function, potentially exposing sensitive information about the contract's balance.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
