The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public totalVotes;

    function vote(address delegate, uint256 voteValue) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "Only registered voters can vote");
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Voter has already voted");
        require(delegate != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate vote to yourself");

        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].delegate = delegate;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = voteValue;
        totalVotes += voteValue;
    }

    function delegate(address to) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "Only registered voters can delegate");
        require(to != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate to yourself");

        address delegateTo = to;

        while (voters[delegateTo].delegate != address(0)) {
            delegateTo = voters[delegateTo].delegate;

            require(delegateTo != msg.sender, "Circular delegation is not allowed");
        }

        voters[msg.sender].delegate = delegateTo;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) ID uniqueness violation
2) Inconsistent state update
