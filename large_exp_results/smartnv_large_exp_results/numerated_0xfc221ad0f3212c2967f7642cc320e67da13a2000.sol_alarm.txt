Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal without using the `proposal` struct, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not properly defined in terms of visibility, making it accessible outside of the contract where it could be manipulated.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a significant amount of gas if there are a large number of users with locked funds, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
