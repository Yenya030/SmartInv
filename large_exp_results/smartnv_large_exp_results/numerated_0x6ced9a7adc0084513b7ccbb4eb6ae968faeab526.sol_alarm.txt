The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function may allow for inconsistent state update if multiple calls are made at the same time.
2) Atomicity violation: The endExecute function may have an atomicity violation issue if the requirements are not properly sequenced.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of ID uniqueness violation, as the proposal struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal.
4) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of functions that involve token transfers.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.
