Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute()` updates `proposal.votedAmount` without considering potential race conditions or reentrancy attacks.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not provide the required functions such as `transfer()` or `transferFrom()`. This could lead to issues with contract interoperability.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` contains a potentially costly operation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`. If the operation requires too much gas, the function may fail to execute entirely.
4) Atomicity violation: The logic in `endExecute()` to check `balanceOf(address(this))*2 > totalSupply()` and then set `lockedFunds` may not be atomic, leading to potential inconsistencies.
