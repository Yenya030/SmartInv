This contract may potentially have the following vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without resetting the previous proposal state, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the proposal state without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a significant amount of gas to execute, which could lead to out-of-gas exceptions and contract failures.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the intended access control mechanism for ownership management.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Insufficient gas
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
