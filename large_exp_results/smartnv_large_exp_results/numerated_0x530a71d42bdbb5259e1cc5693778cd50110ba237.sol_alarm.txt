Vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: Lack of checking for duplicate proposals may lead to ID uniqueness violation.
2) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes within functions that might not be atomic.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract doesn't explicitly define the visibility of functions and variables, which can lead to incorrect visibility and ownership concerns.
