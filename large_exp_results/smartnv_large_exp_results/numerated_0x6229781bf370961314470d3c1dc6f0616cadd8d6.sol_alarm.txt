The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable "proposal" is updated in the "startExecute" and "execute" functions but it is not updated atomically, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Privilege escalation: The "startExecute" function allows any caller to start a new proposal, which may lead to unauthorized privilege escalation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables "owner" and "votingToken", which may lead to incorrect access control.
4) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may fail due to insufficient gas if the calculation of "lockedFunds" requires a large amount of gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
