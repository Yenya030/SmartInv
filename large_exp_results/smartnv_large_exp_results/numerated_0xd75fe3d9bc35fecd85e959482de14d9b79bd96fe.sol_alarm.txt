The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` modifies the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without any check against reentrancy, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined with a visibility keyword, which could lead to unexpected behavior or unintended accessibility.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the `liquidate` function could potentially lead to integer overflow if the values involved are large enough.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function contains a check that requires a gas-heavy operation `(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply())`, which could potentially fail due to running out of gas.
5) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes (transfer and update of `proposal.votedAmount`) without atomicity guarantees, which could lead to inconsistent or unexpected outcomes.
