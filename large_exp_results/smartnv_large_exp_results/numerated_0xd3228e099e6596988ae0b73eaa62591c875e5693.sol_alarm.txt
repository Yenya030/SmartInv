There are several potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: In the startExecute function, the startingBalanceList is updated without any validation or constraints, which might lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute function performs multiple state changes without using any form of atomicity, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if the function fails midway through its execution.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function relies on the availability of enough gas to transfer tokens and update state variables. If there is insufficient gas provided by the caller, this function may fail and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not explicitly defined in the contract, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities related to access control or unauthorized modifications.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
