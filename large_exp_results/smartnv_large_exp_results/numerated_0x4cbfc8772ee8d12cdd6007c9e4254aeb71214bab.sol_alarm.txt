Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without considering potential reentrancy issues.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The `owner` variable is defined as `internal` which may not be the intended visibility level for ownership.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The `execute` function may require significant gas to execute if the condition `proposal.votedAmount == 0` is never met, causing potential out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
