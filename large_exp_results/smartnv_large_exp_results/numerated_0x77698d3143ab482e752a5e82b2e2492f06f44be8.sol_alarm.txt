The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract at the end of execution. This can lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes during the execution of the function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not restrict access to only the intended parties. Consider using the `private` or `public` visibility specifier.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
