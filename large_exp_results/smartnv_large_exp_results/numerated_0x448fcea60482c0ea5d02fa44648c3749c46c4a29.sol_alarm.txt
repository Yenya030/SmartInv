The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The constructor should be marked as public to allow correct initialization of the contract.
2) Privilege escalation: There is a risk of privilege escalation if the 'releaseFunds' and 'refundFunds' functions are called by unintended parties.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is no logic implemented to prevent multiple calls to the 'releaseFunds' or 'refundFunds' functions, leading to inconsistent state updates.
