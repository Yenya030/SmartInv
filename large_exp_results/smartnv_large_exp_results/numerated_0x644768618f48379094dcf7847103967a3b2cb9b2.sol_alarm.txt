Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without any checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled properly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is defined as `internal` which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues if not properly managed.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas provided to execute the required operations, leading to potential issues with the execution of the function.

4) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, which could lead to potential issues if one operation fails while the others succeed.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract, such as `proposal.votedAmount += amount`, which could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.

6) Ether leakage: There are no explicit checks or validations to prevent ether leakage in the contract, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities related to ether handling.
