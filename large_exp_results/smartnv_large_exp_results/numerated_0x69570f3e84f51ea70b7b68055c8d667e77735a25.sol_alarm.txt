The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities such as:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no clear indication of how this value is being utilized or checked for consistency throughout the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which should typically be declared as public or private based on the intended access level. This could lead to ownership control vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas cost implications of the operations it performs, such as transferring tokens. This could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during contract execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
