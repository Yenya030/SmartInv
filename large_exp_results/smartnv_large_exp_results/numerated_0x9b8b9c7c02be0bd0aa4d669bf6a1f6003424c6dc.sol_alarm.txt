potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) atomicity violation: there are multiple state changes in the execute function that are not performed atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) inconsistency state update: the endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract, but this might not accurately reflect the current state due to external transfers.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: the visibility of the owner variable is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts.
4) insufficient gas: the endExecute function relies on the contract having enough gas to perform the desired operations, which could fail if the gas limit is exceeded.
5) ID uniqueness violation: there is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposals, which could lead to potential conflicts or issues with tracking and managing proposals.
