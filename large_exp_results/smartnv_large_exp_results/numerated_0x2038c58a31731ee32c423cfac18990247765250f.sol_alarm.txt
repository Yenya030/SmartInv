Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

3) Business logic flaw: The execute function allows for the possibility of re-voting on a proposal, as the check for proposal.votedAmount being equal to 0 may not prevent multiple votes by the same address.
8) Reentrancy: The transferFrom function in the liquidate function of ExchangeTokens could potentially enable reentrancy attacks if the receiving address performs additional logic that interacts with the contract.
