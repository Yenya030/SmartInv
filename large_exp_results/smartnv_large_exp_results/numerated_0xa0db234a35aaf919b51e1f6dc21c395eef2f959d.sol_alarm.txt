The contract provided for analysis:

contract StakingContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public stakingBalance;
    uint public totalStaked;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function stake(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        stakingBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalStaked += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(stakingBalance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient staked amount");
        stakingBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalStaked -= amount;
    }
}

Output: 
No vulnerabilities identified. Healthy.
