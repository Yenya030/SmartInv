The potential vulnerabilities in the contract to be analyzed are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - owner variable is defined as internal, which may not restrict access as intended.
2) Inconsistent state update - startingBalanceList is being updated in the startExecute function but it is not defined in the contract.
3) Insufficient gas - The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations.
