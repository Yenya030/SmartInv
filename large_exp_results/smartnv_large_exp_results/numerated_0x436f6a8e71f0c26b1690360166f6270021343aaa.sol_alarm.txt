The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call functions that should only be accessible to specific roles or addresses.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple functions that update the state variables like 'proposal' and 'startingBalanceList' without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

3) Atomicity violation: The functions like 'execute' and 'endExecute' perform multiple state changes without using proper atomicity mechanisms, which can result in unexpected behavior if one of the state changes fails.

4) Ether leakage: There is no proper handling of Ether transactions in the contract, which could lead to Ether being stuck in the contract or lost.

5) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility that some functions may require more gas than the default gas limit, leading to transaction failures or unexpected behavior.

6) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and state variables is not explicitly defined, making it unclear who can access or modify them, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.
