The contract being analyzed:

contract TokenCrowdsale {
    address public admin;
    address public tokenAddress;
    address public wallet;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    constructor(address _tokenAddress, address _wallet, uint _tokenPrice) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
        wallet = _wallet;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Incorrect ETH amount");

        ERC20(tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        wallet.transfer(msg.value);
    }

    function changeTokenPrice(uint _newPrice) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change token price");
        tokenPrice = _newPrice;
    }
}

Output: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The buyTokens function should update the token balance of the buyer and the ETH balance of the contract wallet atomically to prevent inconsistent states.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable should have restricted access such that only the designated admin can change the token price to avoid unauthorized modifications.
