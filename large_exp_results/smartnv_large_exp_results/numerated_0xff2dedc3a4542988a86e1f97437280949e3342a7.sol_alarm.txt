The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" field in the Proposal struct is updated directly in the execute function without using proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not provide implementations for the required functions, which can lead to ownership and visibility issues.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential integer overflow in the endExecute function where the balance of the contract is multiplied by 2 without proper overflow protection.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and integer overflow/underflow.
