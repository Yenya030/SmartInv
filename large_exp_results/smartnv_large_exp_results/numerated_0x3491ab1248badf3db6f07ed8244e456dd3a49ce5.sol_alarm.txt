This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the `startingBlance` variable is misspelled and may lead to inconsistency in state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the IERC20 interface, but there are no visible functions related to ERC20 token functionality like `balanceOf`, `transfer`, etc. This could lead to incorrect assumptions about the contract's visibility and ownership.
3) Atomicity violation: In the `execute` function, the increment operation `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` is not atomic and may cause issues if the operation is interrupted midway.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may encounter insufficient gas issues if the `require` statement `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` consumes too much gas.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposals if multiple proposals are submitted by the same address or at the same timestamp.
