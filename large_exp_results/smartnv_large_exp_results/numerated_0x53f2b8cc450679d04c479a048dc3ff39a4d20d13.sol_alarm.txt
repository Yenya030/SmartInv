The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to unintended access and manipulation.
2) Business logic flaw: The function startExecute allows for the same proposer to start multiple proposals without any check, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the votedAmount in the proposal, but there is no check to ensure that the amount is subtracted correctly, leading to potential inconsistency.
4) Atomicity violation: The function execute transfers tokens and updates state variables, but these operations are not wrapped within a single transaction, which can lead to inconsistencies in case of failures.
5) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks the balance of the contract, which can lead to out-of-gas errors if the contract has a large balance.
6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposals or addresses, which can lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Business logic flaw, Inconsistent state update, Atomicity violation, Insufficient gas, and ID uniqueness violation.
