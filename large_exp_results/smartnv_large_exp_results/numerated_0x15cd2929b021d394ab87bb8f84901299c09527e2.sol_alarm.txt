The contract to analyze is:

contract Escrow {
         mapping(address => uint) public balances;
         address public owner;
         uint public totalBalance;

         constructor() {
             owner = msg.sender;
         }

         function deposit() public payable {
             balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
             totalBalance += msg.value;
         }

         function withdraw(uint amount) public {
             require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
             balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
             totalBalance -= amount;
             payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
         }

         function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
             owner = newOwner;
         }
     }

The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:

- privilege escalation
- arbitrary transferownership
- ether leakage
