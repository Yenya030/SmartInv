The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not properly defined or enforced, which could lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
