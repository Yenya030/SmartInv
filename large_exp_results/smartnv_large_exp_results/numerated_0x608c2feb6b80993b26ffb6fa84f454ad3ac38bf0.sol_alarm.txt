The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without proper synchronization or validation checks, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
2) Atomicity violation: The update of `proposal.votedAmount` is not atomic, which may result in race conditions and unexpected outcomes.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.
4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, there may not be enough gas allocated for certain operations in the contract, potentially leading to failed transactions or vulnerabilities.
