Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state variable proposal.votedAmount directly without taking into account potential reentrancy attacks.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract implements the IERC20 interface, but it does not provide any implementation for the required ERC20 functions like transfer, approve, etc. This might lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with other contracts that rely on the ERC20 interface.
