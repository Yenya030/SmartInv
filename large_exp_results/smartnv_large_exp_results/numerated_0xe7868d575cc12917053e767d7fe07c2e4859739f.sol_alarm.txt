The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal is being updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal but may not be intended for internal use only, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
3) Insufficient gas: If the operations in the `execute` function consume a large amount of gas, there may be insufficient gas to complete the transaction, leading to a failed execution.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
5) Atomicity violation: The execution of multiple state-changing operations in the `execute` function is not wrapped in a single transaction, which could result in atomicity violations and inconsistent state updates.
