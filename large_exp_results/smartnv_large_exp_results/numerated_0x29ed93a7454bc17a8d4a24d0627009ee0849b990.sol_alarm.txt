The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the "endExecute" function may lead to inconsistent state updates because the calculation for "lockedFunds" relies on the balance of the contract at a specific point in time, which may change before the function finishes executing.

2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function includes a requirement that checks if the locked funds are greater than half of the total token supply, which may require a significant amount of gas to execute and could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility or ownership of variables and functions, which could lead to potential access control issues.
