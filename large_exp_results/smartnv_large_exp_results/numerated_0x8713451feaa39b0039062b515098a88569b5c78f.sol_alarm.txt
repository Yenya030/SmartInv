The contract that needs to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Escrow {
         address public seller;
         address public buyer;
         uint public price;

         function createEscrow(address _seller, address _buyer, uint _price) public {
             seller = _seller;
             buyer = _buyer;
             price = _price;
         }

         function releasePayment() public {
             require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can release payment");
             payable(buyer).transfer(price);
         }

         function refundPayment() public {
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can refund payment");
             payable(seller).transfer(price);
         }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
