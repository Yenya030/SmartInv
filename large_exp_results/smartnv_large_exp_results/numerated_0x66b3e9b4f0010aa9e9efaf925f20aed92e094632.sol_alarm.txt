The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without using safe arithmetic operations.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if the gas provided is not enough for the required operations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is internal, which may not be the intended visibility for ownership tracking in the contract.
