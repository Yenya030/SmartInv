This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without properly initializing it, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, which could lead to incorrect data.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` includes gas-intensive operations like `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may cause the transaction to run out of gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 

1) Inconsistent state update
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Insufficient gas
