Contract TimelockController is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the votedAmount in the Proposal struct directly without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The function execute transfers tokens and updates the votedAmount in multiple steps without proper atomicity checks, which can leave the contract in an inconsistent state if one of the steps fails.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function tries to compare the balance of the contract with a condition that requires double the total token supply, potentially leading to running out of gas during execution.

Contract ExchangeTokens is healthy.
