Contract to be analyzed:

contract TokenSwap {
         IERC20 public tokenA;
         IERC20 public tokenB;
         address public owner;
         
         constructor(address _tokenA, address _tokenB) {
             tokenA = IERC20(_tokenA);
             tokenB = IERC20(_tokenB);
             owner = msg.sender;
         }
         
         function swap(uint amount) public {
             tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
             tokenB.transferFrom(owner, msg.sender, amount);
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership (the owner variable is public and can be accessed/modified by any external contract)
2) Insufficient gas (if the swap function requires a significant amount of gas, it may fail when called due to gas limitations)
3) Atomicity violation (the swap function does two separate token transfers, which can result in inconsistency if one transfer fails and the other succeeds)
