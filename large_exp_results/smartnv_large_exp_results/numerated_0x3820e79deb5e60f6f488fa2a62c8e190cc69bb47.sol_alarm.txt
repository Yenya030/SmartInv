Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the variables votingToken, proposal, startingBalanceList, lockedFunds, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
2) inconsistent state update: The execution of execute function updates the state of the proposal struct without checking for proper validation, which can lead to inconsistent state.
3) atomicity violation: The execute function transfers tokens and updates the state in multiple steps without atomicity, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
4) insufficient gas: The endExecute function may run out of gas if the balance check consumes too much gas, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
