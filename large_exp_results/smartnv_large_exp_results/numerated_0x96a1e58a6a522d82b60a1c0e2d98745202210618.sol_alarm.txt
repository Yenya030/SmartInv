The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalVotes = 0;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the VotingSystem contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to prevent a user from voting multiple times by using different addresses.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is set as public, which may expose the contract owner's address publicly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the VotingSystem contract are ID uniqueness violation and incorrect visibility/ownership.
