Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for updating the state variables "lockedFunds" and "proposal.votedAmount" without proper synchronization or atomicity checks. This could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract, such as addition and multiplication, without explicit checks for potential integer overflow or underflow.
3) Business logic flaw: The logic for determining the success or failure of an execution in the "endExecute" function might be flawed, as it only checks if the balance of the contract is greater than twice the total supply of the voting token, which might not be a reliable indicator of successful execution.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables like "proposal" is not specified, which could lead to potential risks if these variables are accessed or modified from external contracts. Additionally, the ownership of certain functions or operations is not clearly defined, which could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
