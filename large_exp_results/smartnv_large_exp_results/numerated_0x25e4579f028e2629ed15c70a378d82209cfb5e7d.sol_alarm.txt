The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly updated in the `execute` function without properly handling potential race conditions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` and `votingToken` variables are marked as `internal` which might expose them to unintended access or manipulation.

Therefore, potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
