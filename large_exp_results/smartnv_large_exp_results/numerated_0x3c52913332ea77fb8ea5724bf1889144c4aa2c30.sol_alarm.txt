Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() modifies the state variable lockedFunds without any proper validation or protection.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables WETH, USDC, and pair in ExchangeTokens contract are public, which may expose sensitive information to external actors.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the liquidate() function could potentially result in integer underflow if the values are not properly checked and handled.
