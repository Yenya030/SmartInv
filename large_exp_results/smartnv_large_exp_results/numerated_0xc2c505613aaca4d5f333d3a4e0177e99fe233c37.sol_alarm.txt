The contract under analysis: 

contract Escrow {
    uint public balance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Integer Overflow/Underflow: 
   - In the 'deposit' function, if a large amount of value is sent causing an overflow in the 'balance' variable.
   - In the 'withdraw' function, if 'amount' is larger than the current 'balance', causing an underflow.

2) Insufficient Gas: 
   - In the 'withdraw' function, transferring 'amount' to 'msg.sender' might fail if the gas provided is not enough for the transfer operation.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are Integer Overflow/Underflow and Insufficient Gas.
