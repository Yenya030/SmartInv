The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering any synchronization or locks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which can lead to potential issues related to data visibility and ownership.
