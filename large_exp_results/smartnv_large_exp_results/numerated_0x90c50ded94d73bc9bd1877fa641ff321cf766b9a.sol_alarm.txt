Contract analyzed:

contract Voting {

    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint256 public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(hasVoted[msg.sender] == false, "You have already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function getVoteCount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return totalVotes;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for the uniqueness of voters' addresses, allowing the same address to vote multiple times.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variable totalVotes is public, which exposes the total number of votes to everyone, potentially leading to manipulation.
