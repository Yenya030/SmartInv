The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw:
- In the function "endExecute()", the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");" may result in incorrect state updates.

2) Inconsistent state update:
- In the function "execute()", the update to "proposal.votedAmount" may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for its functions, potentially leading to incorrect access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
