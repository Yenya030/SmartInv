The contract to analyze is:

contract Lottery {
    mapping(address => uint) public players;

    function enter() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Must send some Ether to enter");
        players[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function pickWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can pick a winner");

        uint winner = random() % players.length;
        address winnerAddress;
        uint winnings;

        for(uint i=0; i<players.length; i++) {
            if(i == winner) {
                winnerAddress = players.keys(i);
                winnings = players[winnerAddress];
                break;
            }
        }

        payable(winnerAddress).transfer(winnings);
    }

    function random() private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players.length)));
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) privilege escalation
2) inconsistent state update
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
