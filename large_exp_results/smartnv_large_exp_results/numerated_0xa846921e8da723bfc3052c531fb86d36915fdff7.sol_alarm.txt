The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of identifiers such as proposal addresses or indexes. 

2) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the operations in the functions, there may be a risk of running out of gas during execution.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership settings of the variables and functions are not explicitly mentioned, which could lead to unexpected access control issues.
