The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- In the endExecute function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` could lead to an inconsistent state update if the balance of the contract is not updated properly, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The contract does not specify the visibility of the votingToken variable, which can lead to potential issues with visibility or ownership control over the token.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
