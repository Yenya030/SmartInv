The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `votedProposal` function, which can lead to potential issues with contract interactions.

2) Inconsistent State Update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` line in the `execute` function directly updates the votedAmount variable without proper checks or validations, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient Gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas due to the `votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);` operation, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

4) Business Logic Flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` for execution validation, which might not be a suitable business logic constraint and can lead to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 

- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership
- Inconsistent State Update
- Insufficient Gas
- Business Logic Flaw
