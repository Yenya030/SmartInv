The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper checks and conditions, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
2) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function may have a business logic flaw, as it is unclear how this condition affects the execution of the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and business logic flaw.
