Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:


7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or errors in tracking proposals.

13) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of checks for gas limits in the contract functions, which could potentially result in out-of-gas errors during execution.

14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of some variables and functions in the contract may not be appropriately set, leading to potential issues with accessibility and ownership control.
