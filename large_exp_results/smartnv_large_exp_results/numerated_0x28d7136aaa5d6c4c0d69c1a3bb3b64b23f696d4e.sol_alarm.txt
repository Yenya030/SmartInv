This contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or validation checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `proposal` struct is not specified, which could potentially lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function has a large computation that depends on the size of the balance of `votingToken`, which may result in running out of gas during execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
