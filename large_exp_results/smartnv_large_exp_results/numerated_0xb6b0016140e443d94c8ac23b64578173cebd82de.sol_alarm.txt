The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state of the proposal by incrementing the votedAmount, but this update is not done in an atomic manner which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks the balance of the contract against a condition, but if the gas limit is exceeded during this check, the execution of the function could fail and potentially leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is declared as internal which could allow potential privilege escalation if not properly controlled.
4) ID uniqueness violation: It seems that the proposal variable is not properly initialized before being used, which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential ID uniqueness violations.
5) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function might suffer from an arithmetic flaw if the getPrice() function returns unexpected values, leading to incorrect liquidation results.
