Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" in the Proposal struct is updated without proper checking or protection mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to issues with ownership control and visibility.
