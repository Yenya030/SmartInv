Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates when executing the liquidate function due to the calculation logic for liquidating user funds.
2) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function could be susceptible to price manipulation if external factors influence the balances of USDC and WETH in the pair contract.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is unclear if the debt and collateral mappings should be public, potentially exposing sensitive information to external parties. Ownership of the contract is not explicitly defined, which could lead to ownership control vulnerabilities.
