The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute are not restricted to only the owner of the contract, which could lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. 
2) ID uniqueness violation - The proposal struct does not include a unique identifier, making it possible for multiple proposals to interfere with each other or cause inconsistent state updates. 
3) Inconsistent state update - The execute function updates the votedAmount without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates in a concurrent environment.
4) Business logic flaw - The endExecute function calculates the condition for execution based on the total supply of the voting token, which might not accurately reflect the intended logic and could be exploited for malicious purposes.
