Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals or other entities, which could lead to potential conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `proposal` struct directly, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple executions occur simultaneously.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of overflow/underflow protection in the calculations involving amounts in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions, which could result in unintended behavior.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of state variables and functions is not specified, potentially leading to incorrect access control or visibility issues.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions explicitly, leaving room for potential ether leakage or unauthorized ether transfers.
