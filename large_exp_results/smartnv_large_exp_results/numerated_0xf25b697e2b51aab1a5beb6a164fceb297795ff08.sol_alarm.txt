Potential vulnerabilities in the contract TimelockController:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct directly, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions attempt to update the same proposal simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the necessary functions to comply with the interface. This could lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect the standard ERC20 functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the TimelockController contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
