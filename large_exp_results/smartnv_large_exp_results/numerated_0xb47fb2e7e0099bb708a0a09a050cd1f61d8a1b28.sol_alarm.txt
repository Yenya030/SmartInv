The contract you provided has the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the IERC20 interface, but it is missing the required functions defined in the interface. This could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership of functions and variables.

2) Inconsistent State Update: In the function execute(), the update of the proposal's votedAmount is not done atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the votedAmount simultaneously.

3) Insufficient Gas: The function endExecute() requires checking the balance of the contract (lockedFunds) against the total supply of the votingToken, which could require a considerable amount of gas if the total supply is large, leading to insufficient gas errors.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Incorrect Visibility/Ownership, Inconsistent State Update, and Insufficient Gas.
