The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated inside the `execute` function, but there is no mechanism to ensure that this update is atomic or properly synchronized with other potential updates to `proposal`, which may lead to inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function requires a check that may consume a significant amount of gas (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`), potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not properly encapsulated and directly accessed in external functions, potentially exposing sensitive data.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any validation or enforcement of unique IDs for proposals, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
