The contract being analyzed may have potential vulnerabilities in the following areas:

1) inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring that it is the correct final balance, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `votedProposal()` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
