Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring atomicity, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute properly if there is insufficient gas provided for the required operations.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables `lockedFunds`, `votingToken`, `proposal` is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation of these variables.
4) privilege escalation: There is a potential privilege escalation vulnerability in the `execute` function where the transfer of tokens is not properly handled, allowing unauthorized access to token transfers.
5) reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks as external calls are made within the contract without considering potential reentrancy issues.
