The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` struct, `startingBlance`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, `votedProposal`, and `lockedFunds`. It is important to properly specify the visibility of variables and functions for security and clarity.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential issue with inconsistent state update in the `execute()` function where `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, opening up the possibility of race conditions.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function does multiple state changes without wrapping them in a single atomic operation, which can lead to inconsistent states in case of failures during execution.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are potential risks of integer overflow in the calculations involving `proposal.votedAmount`, which may lead to unexpected behavior if the values exceed the limits of uint256.
5) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions if they involve complex computations or interactions with other contracts. It is important to consider gas limits and optimize gas usage.
6) Privilege escalation: The lack of access control mechanisms or proper ownership verification could potentially lead to privilege escalation attacks where unauthorized users may perform critical operations.
7) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions or payments appropriately, leaving room for Ether leakage or loss if not managed correctly.
8) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute()` function for determining the success of execution based on the balance of the contract may have flaws and could lead to incorrect outcomes or vulnerabilities in the contract's behavior.
