The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` line in the `execute` function directly updates the `votedAmount` without considering potential reentrancy issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `struct Proposal` is being accessed and updated without any specific access modifiers, potentially allowing unauthorized access and manipulation.
