The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:

<\contract\> 
contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid vote amount");
        votes[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalVotes += amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(votes[msg.sender] > 0, "No votes to withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(votes[msg.sender]);
        totalVotes -= votes[msg.sender];
        votes[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
<\contract\> 

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract include:
1) inconsistent state update - totalVotes is updated before setting the votes[msg.sender] to 0
2) arithmetic flaw - totalVotes could potentially underflow if votes[msg.sender] is greater than totalVotes when withdrawn
3) ether leakage - there is a direct transfer of funds to the sender without proper checks and balances
4) ID uniqueness violation - multiple users could potentially have the same address, leading to conflicts in voting and withdrawal

Please analyze and identify potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract.
