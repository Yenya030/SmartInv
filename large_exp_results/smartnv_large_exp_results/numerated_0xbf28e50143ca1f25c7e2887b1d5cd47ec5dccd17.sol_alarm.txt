Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any explicit access control mechanisms, such as modifiers or access control functions, to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.

2) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function based on a condition that checks the balance of the contract against the total token supply. This can lead to inconsistent state if the condition is not properly met.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal visibility of the 'owner' variable may expose it to potential manipulation by external contracts and may not ensure proper ownership control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
