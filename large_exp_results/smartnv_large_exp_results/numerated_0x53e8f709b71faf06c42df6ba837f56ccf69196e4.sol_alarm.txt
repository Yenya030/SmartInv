The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may fail due to running out of gas when checking the condition on line 29 if the number of participants is large.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. 

Overall, the contract exhibits vulnerability potential.
