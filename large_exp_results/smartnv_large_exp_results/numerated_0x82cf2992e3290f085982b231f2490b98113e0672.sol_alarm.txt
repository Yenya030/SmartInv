The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` without considering other potential changes in the contract state, which could lead to inconsistencies.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `liquidate()` executes transfer functions which require gas, and if the user does not have enough gas to cover the cost, the transaction could fail.

3) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate()` function could potentially result in arithmetic flaws if the values of `getPrice()`, `cAmount`, or `dAmount` are manipulated or incorrect.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `calculatePrice()` function is set to `public`, which may expose sensitive information or functionality to external actors. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update 
2) Insufficient gas
3) Arithmetic flaw 
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership.
