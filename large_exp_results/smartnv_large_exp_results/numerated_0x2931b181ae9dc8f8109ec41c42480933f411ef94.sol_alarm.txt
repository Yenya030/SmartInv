Contract to analyze:
contract Vault {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can deposit funds");
        balance += _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        require(balance > _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= _amount;
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change owner");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
Output:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
