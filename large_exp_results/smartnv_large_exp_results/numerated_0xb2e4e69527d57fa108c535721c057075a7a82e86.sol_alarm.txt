The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Inconsistency state update: The function `endExecute` updates `lockedFunds` without any further checks or validations, potentially allowing for incorrect amounts to be recorded.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are public, exposing sensitive user data publicly.
