The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable 'proposal' without verifying if the proposal is already set, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide implementations for its functions, which could lead to incorrect access control and visibility issues.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations in the contract that involve arithmetic calculations without explicit checks for potential integer overflow or underflow, such as in the execute() function.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions but inherits from IERC20, which could potentially result in unintended ether leakage if the contract interacts with other contracts that send ether.

5) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks for the balance of the contract without considering the potential gas cost of the subsequent operations, which may result in insufficient gas to complete the function execution.

6) Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate() function in the ExchangeTokens contract contains an arithmetic operation that calculates the liquidation price, which could introduce arithmetic flaws if not handled accurately.

7) Insufficient validation: The liquidate() function does not perform thorough validation checks before initiating the transfer of funds, potentially exposing the contract to vulnerabilities related to insufficient validation of inputs.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Integer overflow/underflow
4) Ether leakage
5) Insufficient gas
6) Arithmetic flaw
7) Insufficient validation
