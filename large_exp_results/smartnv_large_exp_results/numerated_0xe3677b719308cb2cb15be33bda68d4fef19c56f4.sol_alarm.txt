This contract may have potential vulnerabilities:  

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or addresses used within the contract, which could lead to conflicts or misunderstandings.

10) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs arithmetic calculations without explicit checks for potential arithmetic overflows, underflows, or precision loss.

14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of some functions and variables in the contract may not be set correctly, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionalities to unauthorized access. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, arithmetic flaw, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
