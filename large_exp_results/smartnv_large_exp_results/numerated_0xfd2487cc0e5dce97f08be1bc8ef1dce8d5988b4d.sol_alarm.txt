The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: In the function startExecute(), the startingBalanceList is updated without explicitly initializing it or declaring it in the contract, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: In the function endExecute(), the execution could fail if the gas limit is not enough to cover the transfer of funds, which could result in lockedFunds not being updated correctly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update and Insufficient gas.
