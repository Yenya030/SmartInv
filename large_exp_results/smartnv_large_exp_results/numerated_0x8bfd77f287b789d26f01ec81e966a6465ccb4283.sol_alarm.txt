The contract you are going to analyze: 

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 
        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 
        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in this contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is updated directly, which can lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` do not have explicit visibility specified, which could lead to unintended visibility or access control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: If the operations within the functions consume too much gas, it might cause the transactions to fail due to insufficient gas provided.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could result in ID clashes and unexpected behavior.
