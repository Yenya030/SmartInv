The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows the update of the balance using the `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance;` without proper validation or atomic operation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal variable `owner` is declared as `address  internal owner;`, which may suggest an ownership mechanism, but it is not used or implemented in the contract. This inconsistency could lead to incorrect assumptions about ownership and visibility within the contract.
