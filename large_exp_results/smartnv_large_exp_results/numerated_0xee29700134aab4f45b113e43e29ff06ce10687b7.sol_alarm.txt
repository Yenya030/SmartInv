The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `votedProposal` function, which can lead to issues with who can call and access this function.
2) inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function without any additional checks or conditions, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) insufficient gas: The `transferFrom` function calls in the `execute` and `liquidate` functions could potentially run out of gas and cause the transactions to fail.
4) atomicity violation: The `execute` function has multiple separate operations that are not encapsulated within a single atomic transaction, which can lead to unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails midway.
