The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation - There are no mechanisms in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or users, which could lead to conflicts or errors.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The access modifiers for functions and variables are not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation by external contracts or entities.
3) Insufficient gas - There is a risk of running out of gas during contract execution, especially in functions like endExecute() where gas consumption is not accounted for.
4) Arithmetic flaw - There are arithmetic operations like multiplication and division without proper checks or overflow/underflow prevention, which can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
