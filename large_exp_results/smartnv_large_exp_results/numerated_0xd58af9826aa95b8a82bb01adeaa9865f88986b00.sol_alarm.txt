The contract provided for analysis:

contract SwapTokens {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function swapTokens(uint amountA, uint amountB) external {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountA, "Insufficient balance for token A");
        require(tokenB.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountB, "Insufficient balance for token B");

        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The contract allows users to swap tokens but does not update the balances of the tokens after the transfer, which could lead to inconsistencies in the token balances.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the tokenA and tokenB variables is public, which may not be ideal for certain scenarios where limited visibility is preferred.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas exceptions or provide gas stipends, which could result in failed transactions.
- Integer underflow/overflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations on token amounts without proper checks for potential underflow or overflow conditions.
