The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is being incremented in the 'execute' function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is declared as public, which can expose sensitive information to external parties.

3) Insufficient gas: If the 'execute' function requires a large amount of gas for execution, it may fail due to insufficient gas limit set by the user.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'lockedFunds' variable is not specified with a visibility modifier, making it publicly accessible.

5) Atomicity violation: The operations in the 'execute' function are not atomic, which can lead to undesirable outcomes if one of the operations fails midway.

6) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of duplicate IDs for proposals if proper uniqueness checks are not implemented.

7) Ether leakage: There is a potential for ether leakage if ether transactions are not handled properly within the contract.
