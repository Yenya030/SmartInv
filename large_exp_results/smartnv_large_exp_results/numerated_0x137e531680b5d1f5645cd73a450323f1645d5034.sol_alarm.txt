The potential vulnerabilities in the contract include:
1) inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state update as the payments mapping can be modified by any user calling the makePayment function.
2) ether leakage: The contract transfers ether to the owner without checking if the transfer was successful, which may lead to ether leakage. 
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes the owner's address to everyone. This could potentially pose a security risk.
