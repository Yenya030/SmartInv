Contract to be analyzed:

contract PaymentGateway {
     address public owner;
     mapping(address => uint) public balance;

     function deposit() public payable {
         balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }
   
     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
         payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
     }
} 

Potential vulnerabilities identified in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The balance of the user is updated directly without any checks which may lead to inconsistent state if proper checks are not implemented.
2) Ether leakage: The transfer function sends ether to the caller without proper handling which can lead to ether leakage if the call stack is not handled properly.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify the gas limit for the transfer function which may cause transactions to fail due to insufficient gas.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public which may expose sensitive information about the contract owner and ownership control. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, ether leakage, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
