Contract TimelockController contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The function endExecute checks if the lockedFunds are greater than half of the total voting token supply for a successful execution. This logic may be flawed and could lead to incorrect outcomes.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not properly define the functions required by the interface, which could lead to issues with contract visibility and ownership.
