The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Insufficient gas: The contract may encounter gas limit issues due to complex operations in functions that involve token transfers and balance calculations.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the desired access control mechanism for ownership.

3) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the `proposal` is updated without proper synchronization or locking mechanism, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are executed concurrently.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of `proposal.addr` values, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- ID uniqueness violation
