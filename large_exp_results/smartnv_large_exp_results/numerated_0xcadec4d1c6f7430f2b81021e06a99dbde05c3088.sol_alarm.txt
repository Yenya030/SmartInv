The contract has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the starting balance is updated without initializing `proposal`. This can lead to an inconsistent state and potential issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly without considering potential concurrency issues, leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Inconsistent state update: Similar to the `execute` function, the `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without a proper check or protection against inconsistent state updates.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface, but it is not clear if the necessary functions are properly implemented or if the contract has the required ownership setup.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple calculations and assignments in the contract that involve arithmetic operations, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow issues if not handled carefully.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Integer overflow/underflow
