Potential vulnerabilities in the TimelockController contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from starting, executing, or ending proposals, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the startExecute function, the variable startingBalanceList is updated without any safeguard to ensure that it is done consistently with other state changes, which may lead to an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may impact the intended visibility or ownership design of the contract and result in unexpected behavior.
