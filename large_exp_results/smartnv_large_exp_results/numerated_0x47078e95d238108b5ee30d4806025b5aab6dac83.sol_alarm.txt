The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function allows for the possibility of failing the execution based on the comparison of `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` and `votingToken.totalSupply()`. This logic could potentially be flawed, leading to unexpected behavior.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBlance` variable in the `startExecute` function is declared locally and not used outside of the function. This could lead to unintended results if the intention was to use it elsewhere in the contract.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are business logic flaw and incorrect visibility/ownership.
