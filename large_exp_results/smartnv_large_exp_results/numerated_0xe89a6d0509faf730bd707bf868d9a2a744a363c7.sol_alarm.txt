The contract being analyzed may have potential vulnerabilities in the following areas:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface, but it is missing the necessary functions for transferring tokens, which could lead to issues with ownership and visibility.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'startExecute' function updates the 'proposal' state variable without checking if it is already in use, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function checks the balance of the contract and total supply of the token, which can consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas issues.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be a mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or incorrect data handling.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations involving addition and division of integers that could potentially result in overflow or underflow vulnerabilities if not properly handled.
