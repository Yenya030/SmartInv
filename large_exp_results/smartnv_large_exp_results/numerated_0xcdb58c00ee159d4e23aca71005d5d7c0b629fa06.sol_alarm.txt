The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities: 

<\contract\>
contract Auction {
         mapping(address => uint) public bids;
         uint public highestBid;
         address public highestBidder; 

         function placeBid(uint _amount) public {
             require(_amount > highestBid, "Bid amount is not higher than the current highest bid");
             bids[msg.sender] = _amount;
         }

         function finalizeAuction() public {
             require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can finalize the auction");
             // code to transfer assets to the highest bidder
         }
}
<\contract\>

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
