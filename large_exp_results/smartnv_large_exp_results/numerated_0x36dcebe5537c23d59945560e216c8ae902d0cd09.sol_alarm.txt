The following contract may have potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` seems to update the state of the contract by setting the `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList`, but it does not check if the `proposal.sTime` is already set, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` implements the interface `IERC20`, but it is unclear if the necessary functions from the interface are implemented with the correct visibility and ownership. 

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` might require a significant amount of gas to perform the check `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`, which could potentially lead to running out of gas during execution. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
