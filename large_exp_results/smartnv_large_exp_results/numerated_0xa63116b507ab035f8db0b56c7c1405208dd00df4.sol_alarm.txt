The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Inconsistent state update - The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if a proposal is already ongoing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Atomicity violation - The increment operation on proposal.votedAmount in the execute() function is not protected by any locking mechanism, which may lead to race conditions.
3) ID uniqueness violation - There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could result in conflicts or data corruption.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not specify visibility (public, private, internal) for functions and variables, which may lead to unintended access or manipulation of contract state.
