Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution of certain functions, leading to incomplete transactions or potential security risks.
2) inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data states.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain functions and variables is not specified, which can lead to potential accessibility and ownership issues.
