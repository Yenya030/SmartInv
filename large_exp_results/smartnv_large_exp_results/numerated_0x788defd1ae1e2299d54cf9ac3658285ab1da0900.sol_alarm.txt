The potential vulnerabilities in the contract at the end are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "lockedFunds" is updated in the "endExecute" function without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The "execute" function updates the "proposal.votedAmount" variable without proper atomicity checks, leaving room for race conditions and incorrect calculations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "lockedFunds" variable is not specified, potentially leading to unexpected access or visibility issues.

4) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function performs multiple state checks and calculations which may require high gas costs, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors during execution.
