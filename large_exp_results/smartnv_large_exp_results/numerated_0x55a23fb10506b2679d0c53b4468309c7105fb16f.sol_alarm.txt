The contract you are going to analyze: 

contract TokenSwap {
     IERC20 public tokenA;
     IERC20 public tokenB;
     address public owner;

     constructor(address _tokenA, address _tokenB) {
          tokenA = IERC20(_tokenA);
          tokenB = IERC20(_tokenB);
          owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function swap(uint amount) public {
          require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
          tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
          tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
     }

     function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can perform this action");
          owner = newOwner;
     }
}

Output: 
1) privilege escalation: The changeOwner function allows the owner to be changed by calling the function, which can lead to privilege escalation if not properly restricted.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which could pose a security risk if sensitive information is exposed or manipulated.
