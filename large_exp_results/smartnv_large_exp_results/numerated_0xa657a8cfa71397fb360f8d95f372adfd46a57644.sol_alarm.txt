The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: Proposal state variables are modified directly without using proper checks and balances.
2) Atomicity violation: Multiple state changes occur within the same function without proper safeguards, which could lead to unexpected behaviors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify proper visibility for the state variables and functions, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
