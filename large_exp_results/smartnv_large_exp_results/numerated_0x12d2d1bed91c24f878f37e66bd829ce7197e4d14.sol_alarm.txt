The provided contract is:

```solidity
contract KYCContract {
    mapping(address => bool) public isVerified;

    function verify(address user) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can verify users");
        isVerified[user] = true;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is not defined in the contract, so the `require` statement checking for ownership in the `verify` function won't work as intended.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerability in the contract is incorrect visibility/ownership.
