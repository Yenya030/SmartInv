The contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
        totalVotes = 0;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "You are not authorized to change admin");
        admin = newAdmin;
    }

    function removeVote(address user) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "You are not authorized to remove a vote");
        require(hasVoted[user], "This user has not voted");
        totalVotes--;
        hasVoted[user] = false;
    }
}

Output:
- privilege escalation
- incorrect visibility/ownership
