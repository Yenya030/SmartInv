The contract being analyzed contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not ensure consistent state updates when executing proposals. There is a risk of inconsistent state due to lack of proper synchronization mechanisms.
2) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, which may lead to incomplete or failed operations. Additional gas considerations should be implemented.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is unclear if the visibility and ownership settings for certain variables and functions are appropriately defined, raising concerns about potential unauthorized access or manipulation.
