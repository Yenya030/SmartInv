The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any check or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "pair" variable in the ExchangeTokens contract is public, which could potentially expose sensitive information or functionality.
3) Arithmetic flaw: The "liquidate" function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs arithmetic calculations on prices without proper handling for potential underflow or overflow situations.
