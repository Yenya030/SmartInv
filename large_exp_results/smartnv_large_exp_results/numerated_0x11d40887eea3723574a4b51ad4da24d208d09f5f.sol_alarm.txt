Given contract: 

contract Vault {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limits for functions such as withdraw, which may result in transactions failing if they require more gas than available.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public which exposes it to potential manipulation by external actors. It should be made private and have a getter function if needed.
3) Ether leakage: When transferring funds in the withdraw function, the use of transfer can lead to reentrancy attacks. Using a withdrawal pattern with checks-effects-interactions can mitigate this vulnerability.
