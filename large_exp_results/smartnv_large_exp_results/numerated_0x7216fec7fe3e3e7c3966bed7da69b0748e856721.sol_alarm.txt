potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is missing visibility specifier for the IERC20 interface, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- insufficient gas: The execution of functions like `execute` and `endExecute` may require significant gas to process the transactions, which could result in an out-of-gas error.
- inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, changing the `proposal.votedAmount` without performing proper checks and balances could result in inconsistent state updates.
