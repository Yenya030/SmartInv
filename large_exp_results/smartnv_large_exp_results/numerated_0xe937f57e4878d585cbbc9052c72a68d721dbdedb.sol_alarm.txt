The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Insufficient gas: There are functions in the contract that require external calls to transfer tokens, which can consume a considerable amount of gas. If the contract does not provide enough gas for these operations, they may fail unexpectedly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, which can lead to confusion and potential security risks if certain functions are meant to be restricted to specific users.

3) Inconsistent state update: The state variables in the contract are updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data and unexpected behavior.

4) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute` function might not achieve the intended result of validating the execution, as the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` could be flawed.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Insufficient gas, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Business logic flaw.
