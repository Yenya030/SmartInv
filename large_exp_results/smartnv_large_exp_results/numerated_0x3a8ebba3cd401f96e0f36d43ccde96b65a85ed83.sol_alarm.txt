Contract Analysis:

The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:

contract PaymentSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[to] += amount;
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer underflow in the withdraw function if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than the balance of the sender. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as public, which exposes it to the outside world. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the owner state.
