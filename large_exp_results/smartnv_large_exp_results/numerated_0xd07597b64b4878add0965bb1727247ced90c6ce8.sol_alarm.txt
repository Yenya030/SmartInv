The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: 
The variables `lockedFunds` and `proposal.votedAmount` are being updated without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
The `votingToken` contract is being accessed internally without explicitly specifying visibility (like private or internal), which could potentially expose sensitive functions or data to external entities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
