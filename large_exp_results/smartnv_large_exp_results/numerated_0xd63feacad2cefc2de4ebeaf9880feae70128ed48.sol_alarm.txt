The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly specify the visibility of variables and functions, which can lead to unintended access and manipulation by external contracts.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is updated in the `startExecute` function and then checked in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions, which can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially gas-intensive operation by checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may exceed the gas limit and cause the function to fail.
4) Privilege escalation: There is no clear access control mechanism in place to restrict certain functions to only be called by authorized users, leading to potential privilege escalation issues.
