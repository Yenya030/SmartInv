The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without utilizing a proper locking mechanism, which could lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and `proposal` variable are accessed externally without proper access control mechanisms, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposal data.
