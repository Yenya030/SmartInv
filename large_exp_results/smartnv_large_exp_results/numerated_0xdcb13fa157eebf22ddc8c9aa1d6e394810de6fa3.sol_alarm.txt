Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function does not properly update the state of the contract by setting the correct value for "lockedFunds."
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, internal, private) for the "proposal" variable, which can lead to issues related to data visibility and ownership control.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the system.
