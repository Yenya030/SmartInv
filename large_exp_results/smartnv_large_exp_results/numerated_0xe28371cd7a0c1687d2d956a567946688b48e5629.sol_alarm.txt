The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            payable(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid);
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can withdraw");
        uint amount = highestBid;
        highestBid = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract Auction:
1) Insufficient gas
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
