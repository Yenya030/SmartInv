The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users or roles. This can lead to privilege escalation issues where unauthorized users can access and manipulate critical functions.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state within the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of insufficient gas provided for certain functions, which can cause them to fail or behave unexpectedly.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables are not clearly defined in the contract, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
