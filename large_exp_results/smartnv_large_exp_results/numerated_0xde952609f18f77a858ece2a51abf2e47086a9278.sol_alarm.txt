The given contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper checks in the "execute" function to ensure that only the rightful proposer can execute the proposal. This can lead to unauthorized individuals executing proposals.

2) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function modifies the state of the proposal without updating the "votedAmount" in a way that may lead to inconsistent data.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function might fail if there is insufficient gas to complete the computation, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
