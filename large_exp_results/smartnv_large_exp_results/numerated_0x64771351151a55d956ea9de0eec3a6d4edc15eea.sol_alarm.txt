The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state of `proposal` without any validation or check, which may lead to inconsistent data. 

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may run out of gas as it is doing a complex computation of `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which can potentially result in out of gas error. 

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract seems to be implementing the interface `IERC20`, but the visibility of the functions is not specified, which can lead to incorrect visibility and potential issues with ownership control. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent state update, Insufficient gas, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
