The contract provided for analysis appears to contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() is updating the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or checks, which may lead to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20 but is missing the required functions, which may result in incorrect visibility or ownership of functions.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() is performing multiple operations that involve external calls and calculations, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially fail due to gas limits.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to enforce uniqueness for proposal identifiers like proposal.addr, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

5) Atomicity violation: The functions startExecute() and execute() are performing multiple operations that should be executed atomically but are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, potentially leading to unexpected results.

6) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have any mechanism to prevent self-destruct operations, which may allow malicious actors to terminate the contract and disrupt its functionality.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, atomicity violation, and suicidal contracts.
