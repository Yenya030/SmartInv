The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the proposal state without properly checking if there is an ongoing proposal, allowing for inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow: The execute function does not have proper checks for potential integer overflows when adding the voted amount to the proposal.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, potentially leading to issues with visibility and ownership control.

4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may run out of gas when checking if the execution failed, potentially leading to incomplete execution.

5) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply, which may not be the intended business logic.

6) Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract uses arithmetic operations that may not produce the intended results, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

7) Cross bridge inconsistency: The liquidate function transfers tokens between the contract and user without properly handling potential inconsistencies, leading to cross-bridge inconsistency vulnerabilities.
