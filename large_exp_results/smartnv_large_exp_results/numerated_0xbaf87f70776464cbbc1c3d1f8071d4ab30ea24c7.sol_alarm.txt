The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: When the `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is updated, it is directly done using the `+=` operator, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not declared as public or internal, which may lead to incorrect visibility and ownership concerns.
3) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of the `endExecute` function, it may result in incomplete execution and potential vulnerabilities.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
5) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function may have a business logic flaw depending on the intended functionality.
