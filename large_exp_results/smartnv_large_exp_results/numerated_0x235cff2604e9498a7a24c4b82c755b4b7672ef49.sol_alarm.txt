The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the state variable lockedFunds without considering any locking mechanism to prevent reentrancy attacks.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, which could lead to unintended access control issues.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
