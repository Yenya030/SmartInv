Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no explicit ID generation or uniqueness check for proposals, which may lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
- Atomicity violation: Operations such as updating the votedAmount in the execute function are not atomic, leaving room for inconsistencies or race conditions.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables should be carefully considered to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.
