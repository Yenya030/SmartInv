For the contract provided, potential vulnerabilities are:

1) inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to unexpected behavior due to inconsistent state.
2) integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs mathematical operations without checking for potential overflow or underflow, which could result in unexpected values or vulnerabilities.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of its functions or variables, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by unauthorized parties.
4) ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transfers securely, which could result in potential leakage of Ether or loss of funds.
5) insufficient gas: The contract does not account for potential gas limits or gas costs, which could result in failed transactions or unexpected behavior due to insufficient gas provided.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, incorrect visibility/ownership, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
