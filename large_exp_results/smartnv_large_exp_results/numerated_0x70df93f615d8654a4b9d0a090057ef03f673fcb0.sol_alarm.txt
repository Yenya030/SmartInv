The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = IERC20(_token);
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) external {
        uint cost = amount * price;
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        owner.transfer(cost);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation `uint cost = amount * price;` in the `buyTokens` function may result in an integer overflow if the `amount` and `price` values are not constrained within safe ranges.

2) Ether leakage: The `owner.transfer(cost);` statement in the `buyTokens` function can lead to ether leakage if the transfer is not handled properly, potentially leaving the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

3) Insufficient gas: The `owner.transfer(cost);` statement in the `buyTokens` function may fail if the gas stipend provided by the EVM is insufficient for the transfer, leading to a denial of service vulnerability.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Ether leakage
- Insufficient gas
