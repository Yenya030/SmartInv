Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement proper access control mechanisms, potentially allowing unauthorized users to call sensitive functions or modify state variables.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly define the visibility of functions or ownership of certain actions, which can result in unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.
