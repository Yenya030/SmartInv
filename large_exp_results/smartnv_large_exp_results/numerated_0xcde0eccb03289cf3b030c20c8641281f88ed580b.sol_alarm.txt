The contract to analyze:

```solidity
contract LoanContract {
    
    address public lender;
    address public borrower;
    
    uint public loanAmount;
    uint public interestRate;
    uint public remainingBalance;
    
    function loan(uint _amount, address _borrower) public {
        require(msg.sender != _borrower, "Lender cannot borrow from themselves");
        loanAmount = _amount;
        lender = msg.sender;
        borrower = _borrower;
        remainingBalance = loanAmount;
    }
    
    function payback(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == borrower, "Only borrower can pay back the loan");
        require(_amount <= remainingBalance, "Cannot pay more than the remaining balance");
        remainingBalance -= _amount;
    }
    
    function chargeInterest(uint _rate) public {
        require(msg.sender == lender, "Only lender can charge interest");
        interestRate = _rate;
        remainingBalance += (remainingBalance * interestRate) / 100;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: In the `chargeInterest` function, there is a risk of integer overflow when calculating `remainingBalance += (remainingBalance * interestRate) / 100;`.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions `payback` and `chargeInterest` should have stricter access control modifiers to ensure that only the intended parties can call them.
