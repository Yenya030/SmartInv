The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates, especially in functions like `execute()` where the `proposal.votedAmount` and `votedProposal` are updated without proper synchronization.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which may lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to visibility.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not have explicit checks for potential integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in functions like `execute()` where arithmetic operations are carried out without proper bounds checking.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract may be vulnerable to running out of gas in scenarios where the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of functions like `endExecute()` due to potential operations consuming excessive gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, integer overflow/underflow, and insufficient gas.
