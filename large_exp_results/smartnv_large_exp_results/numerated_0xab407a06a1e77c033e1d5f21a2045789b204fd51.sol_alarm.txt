The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance = 0;
    }

    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        balance += _amount;
        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= _amount;
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The `deposit` and `withdraw` functions are susceptible to integer overflow/underflow if the amount deposited or withdrawn exceeds the maximum or minimum uint value.

2) Ether leakage: There is no function to withdraw Ether from the contract, so Ether sent to the contract will be stuck indefinitely, leading to ether leakage.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which may expose the owner's address to unauthorized parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow, ether leakage, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
