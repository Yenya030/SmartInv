1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which could potentially allow unauthorized access or manipulation of the owner.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of synchronization mechanism such as mutex or locking mechanism in the execute function, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple executions occur simultaneously.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function might fail to execute if there is not enough gas provided, leading to potential issues in the execution process.
