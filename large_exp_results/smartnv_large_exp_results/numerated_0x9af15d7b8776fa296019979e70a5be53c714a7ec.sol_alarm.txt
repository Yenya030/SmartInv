The contract provided for analysis is: 

contract MultiSigWallet {
    uint[] public transactions;
    address[] public owners;
    mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) public approvals;
  
    function submitTransaction(uint txId) public {
        transactions.push(txId);
    }

    function approveTransaction(uint txId) public {
        approvals[txId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function executeTransaction(uint txId) public {
        require(transactions[txId] != 0, "Transaction does not exist");
        
        // Check if all owners approved
        for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            require(approvals[txId][owners[i]], "Not all owners approved");
        }
        
        // Execute transaction
        transactions[txId] = 1;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: It allows changing the state of the transaction without checking for the actual approval status of all owners.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The transactions are indexed by ID, but there is no explicit check for ID uniqueness when submitting a transaction.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the ownership and control mechanisms, which may lead to unauthorized operations.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract executes multiple operations within loops which can lead to running out of gas during transaction execution.
