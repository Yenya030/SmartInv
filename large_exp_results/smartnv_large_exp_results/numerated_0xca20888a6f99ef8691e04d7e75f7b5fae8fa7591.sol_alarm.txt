The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]`, which might lead to inconsistent states if not managed properly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` implements `IERC20` interface but does not contain the required functions for ERC20 tokens. This could lead to issues related to incorrect visibility or ownership of functions related to ERC20 standard.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a calculation that involves querying the balance of the contract, which might consume too much gas and result in an out of gas error if the contract balance is too large.
