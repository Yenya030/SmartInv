Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility in variables and functions (owner, votingToken, proposal, startingBalanceList, lockedFunds).
2) Atomicity violation in the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions.
3) Insufficient gas in the endExecute function.
4) Possible privilege escalation issues by allowing anyone to call the startExecute function.
5) Inconsistent state update in the execute function with proposal.votedAmount += amount without proper checks.
6) ID uniqueness violation in the execute function with the proposal struct.
7) Integer overflow/underflow risks in the execute function with proposal.votedAmount and votedProposal.
