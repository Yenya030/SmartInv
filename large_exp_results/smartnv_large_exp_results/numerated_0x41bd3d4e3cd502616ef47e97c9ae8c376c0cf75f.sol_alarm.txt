The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update in the function startExecute() as the proposal is updated before the starting balance, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may face insufficient gas as the amount of lockedFunds is updated based on the balance of the contract, which could exceed gas limit and fail to execute.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not fully define the functions from the interface, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
