Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility - Some functions are marked as external when they should be marked as public.
2) Inconsistent state update - The function execute() updates proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent states.
3) Insufficient gas - The endExecute() function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the operations within the block limit.
