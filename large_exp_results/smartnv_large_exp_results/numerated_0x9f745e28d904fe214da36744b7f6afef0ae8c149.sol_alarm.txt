The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Insufficient gas: There is no gas stipend provided for the withdrawal function, which can lead to failures in the withdrawal process due to out-of-gas errors.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, which exposes sensitive information about users' balances to anyone who interacts with the contract.
