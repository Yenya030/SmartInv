There are several potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function, but there is no indication of how this variable is being used or managed elsewhere in the contract. This could potentially lead to inconsistent states or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is marked as internal, which may not provide the desired visibility or ownership control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- inconsistent state update
- incorrect visibility/ownership
