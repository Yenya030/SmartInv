Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is not initialized before being accessed in various functions, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which may lead to incorrect visibility and ownership concerns.
- Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas estimation or handling in the contract functions, which may result in transactions running out of gas.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique IDs when storing data in mappings, which may lead to ID uniqueness violations.
- Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function for the liquidation threshold may have arithmetic flaws, as it relies on the result of `getPrice()` which may be manipulated.

Overall, the contract contains multiple vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the system.
