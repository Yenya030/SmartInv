The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- In the `startExecute` function, the starting balance of the proposal addr is obtained and stored in the `startingBalanceList`, but the startingBalanceList mapping is not defined in the contract. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide implementations for the functions defined in the interface. This could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

3) Business logic flaw:
- The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than double the total supply of the voting token before ending the execution. This logic may not be appropriate for the intended functionality and could be a business logic flaw.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
