The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() external {
        votes[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function getVotes(address _voter) external view returns(uint) {
        return votes[_voter];
    }

    function getTotalVotes() external view returns(uint) {
        return totalVotes;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
7) ID uniqueness violation - There is no mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of voter addresses, which may lead to mismatches or inaccuracies in the voting data.
11) Suicidal contracts - There is no implemented functionality to pause or stop the contract, leaving it vulnerable to potential suicide attacks.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The functions are declared as external, which may allow unauthorized access to critical functionality and data.
