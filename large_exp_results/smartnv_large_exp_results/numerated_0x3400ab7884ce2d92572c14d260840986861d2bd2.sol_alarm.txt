The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function may have a business logic flaw as the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` does not necessarily ensure correct execution logic.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership control.
