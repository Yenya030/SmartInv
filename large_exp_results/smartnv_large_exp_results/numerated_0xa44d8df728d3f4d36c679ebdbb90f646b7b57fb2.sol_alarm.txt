The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state variable without proper validation or synchronization, leading to potential inconsistent state.
2) Atomicity violation: 
   - The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, which could result in atomicity violations.
3) Ether leakage: 
   - There are instances where Ether or tokens are transferred without proper checks or validation, which could potentially lead to ether leakage vulnerabilities.
