The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

- Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` sets the `lockedFunds` variable without proper validation or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, leading to potential issues with accessibility and ownership control.
