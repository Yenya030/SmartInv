Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) The contract does not include a modifier to restrict the withdraw function only to the owner, which could lead to privilege escalation if malicious users are able to withdraw funds from other addresses.
2) There is a possibility of insufficient gas being provided for the withdraw function, resulting in a failed transaction or reentrancy vulnerability if the transfer fails halfway through the process.
3) There is an inconsistency in updating the balances mapping in the deposit and withdraw functions, which could lead to atomicity violation or inconsistent state update issues.
4) There is no check for possible integer overflow/underflow in the balances mapping, which could result in unexpected behavior if large amounts are deposited or withdrawn.
