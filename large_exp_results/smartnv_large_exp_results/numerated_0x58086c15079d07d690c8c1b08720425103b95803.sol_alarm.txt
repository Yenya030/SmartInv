Output: 
- ID uniqueness violation: The submitTransaction function increments the transactionId without ensuring the uniqueness of the transactionId, which could lead to overwriting existing transactions.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The addOwner function allows any address to be added as an owner without any authorization or verification process.
