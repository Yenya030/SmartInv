The contract to be analyzed:
<\contract_to_be_analyzed\> 
contract MultiSigWallet {
    address[] public owners;
    mapping(address => bool) public isOwner;
    uint public transactionCount;
    
    struct Transaction {
        address from;
        address to;
        uint amount;
        bool executed;
    }

    mapping(uint => Transaction) public transactions;
    
    constructor(address[] memory _owners) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; i++) {
            owners.push(_owners[i]);
            isOwner[_owners[i]] = true;
        }
    }

    function submitTransaction(address _to, uint _amount) public {
        transactions[transactionCount] = Transaction(msg.sender, _to, _amount, false);
        transactionCount++;
    }

    function executeTransaction(uint _transactionId) public {
        require(transactions[_transactionId].executed == false, "Transaction already executed");
        require(isOwner[msg.sender], "Only wallet owners can execute transactions");

        transactions[_transactionId].to.transfer(transactions[_transactionId].amount);
        transactions[_transactionId].executed = true;
    }

    function revokeTransaction(uint _transactionId) public {
        require(msg.sender == transactions[_transactionId].from, "Only transaction sender can revoke");

    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The function 'executeTransaction' allows any caller to execute a transaction, which could lead to privilege escalation.
2) Reentrancy - The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks in the 'executeTransaction' function.
3) ID uniqueness violation - There is a possibility of transaction ID collision as the transaction ID is incremented without ensuring uniqueness.
4) Atomicity violation - The 'executeTransaction' function does not perform all actions atomically, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.

Please note that the contract does not have inherent vulnerabilities of integer overflow/underflow, arithmetic flaw, suicidal contracts, ether leakage, insufficient gas, price manipulation, cross bridge inconsistency, or ID uniqueness violation.
