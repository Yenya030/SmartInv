Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to prevent multiple executions of the same proposal, leading to possible inconsistencies in the state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility for this variable. Review if it should be `public` or if additional access control mechanisms are needed.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially costly operation by checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may require large amounts of gas and could lead to out-of-gas exceptions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
