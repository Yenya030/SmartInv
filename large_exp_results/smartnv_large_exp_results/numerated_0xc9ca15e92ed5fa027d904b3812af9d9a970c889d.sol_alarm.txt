The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:
- Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state if other operations are performed on the contract balance concurrently.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for an integer underflow in the liquidate function if the calculation getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 results in a value that is higher than dAmount.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the functions in the contract is not specified, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to access control.
