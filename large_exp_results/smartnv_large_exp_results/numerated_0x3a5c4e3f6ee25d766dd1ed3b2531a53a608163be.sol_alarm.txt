The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` may not accurately determine the execution status due to the use of `proposal.sTime` and `block.timestamp`.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` does not lock the state variables during the transfer operation, which may lead to race conditions and inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility and ownership modifiers for the functions, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of contract state by external entities.
