contract SwapContract {
         IERC20 public token1;

         uint public rate;

         function swapTokens(uint amount) public {
             require(token1.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
             uint amountToReceive = amount * rate;
             token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
             token2.transfer(msg.sender, amountToReceive);
         }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the SwapContract are:
- Arithmetic flaw in the calculation of amountToReceive.
- Insufficient gas for executing the swapTokens function.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership in the token1 and token2 variables.
