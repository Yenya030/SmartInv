The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    address public owner;
    bool public votingOpen;
    
    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        votingOpen = true;
    }
    
    function delegate(address to) public {
        require(votingOpen, "Voting is closed");
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Delegate loop detected");
        }
        
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
        Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];
        if (delegateTo.voted) {
            delegateTo.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }
    
    function vote(uint256 option) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(votingOpen, "Voting is closed");
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted");
        
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = option;
    }
    
    function closeVoting() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can close voting");
        votingOpen = false;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: There is no access control on the `closeVoting` function, allowing anyone to call this function.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle cases where a voter has already voted or delegated their vote, leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Business logic flaw: The `delegate` function does not adequately handle delegate loops, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The `delegate` function could run out of gas in case of delegate loops, resulting in an incomplete transaction.
