Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without using a proper locking mechanism, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is defined as internal, which could potentially lead to confusion or unintended access if not properly managed.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than provided, leading to it failing to execute completely, especially if the transferred `amount` is large.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique proposal IDs, which could potentially lead to conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
5) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple operations that should be executed atomically to avoid unexpected behavior, such as transferring tokens and updating proposal state.
