The potential vulnerabilities in the mentioned contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function 'endExecute' updates the 'lockedFunds' variable based on the balance of the contract, but there is no indication of how this variable is being used or managed in the contract.

2) Insufficient gas: The function 'endExecute' performs a comparison operation on the balances, which can potentially consume a large amount of gas and result in an out-of-gas error.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as internal, which may lead to discrepancies in ownership and control of the contract. It is recommended to specify the visibility (public, private, internal) clearly.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
