The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable in the `TimelockController` contract is defined as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility level. It could potentially lead to vulnerabilities related to external access to sensitive data.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function in the `TimelockController` contract updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal directly, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if not properly handled.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function in the `TimelockController` contract may encounter an issue of insufficient gas if the operation of checking the balance and updating `lockedFunds` exceeds the gas limit.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities identified in the provided contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Insufficient gas.
