This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

3) business logic flaw: There is a potential business logic flaw in the `endExecute` function where the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` could lead to unexpected behavior if the balance calculation is not accurate or if there are discrepancies in the total supply.

8) reentrancy: There is a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `execute` function where the order of operations could allow for reentrancy attacks.

12) ether leakage: There is a potential ether leakage vulnerability in the contract where ether can be sent to the contract address but is not handled or accounted for in the functions.

Please note that the contract does not contain vulnerabilities: privilege escalation, price manipulation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, cross bridge inconsistency, ID uniqueness violation, integer overflow/underflow, arithmetic flaw, suicidal contracts, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
