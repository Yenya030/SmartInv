Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle the transfer of Ether (if any) properly, which may lead to Ether leakage.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of functions and variables, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation.
3) Inconsistent state update: There are scenarios where the state variables might not be updated consistently, leading to unexpected behavior.
