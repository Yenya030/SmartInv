Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state without checking if there is an ongoing proposal, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute()` function may require a significant amount of gas to execute, depending on the size of `votedAmount`, leading to potential gas estimation issues.

4) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute()` function checks if the execution has not ended based only on the timestamp, which may not be a robust way to ensure execution completion.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of its operations.
