Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The use of the "proposal" struct for tracking proposals and their status may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously or if multiple transactions interact with the same proposal at the same time.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could potentially lead to conflicts if multiple proposals share the same identifier.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions within the contract is not explicitly defined, which could lead to accessibility issues or potential ownership concerns.
