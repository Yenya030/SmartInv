There are multiple potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Incorrect visibility: The contract does not specify visibility for the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute. This can lead to potential issues if the intended visibility is not correctly set.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have proper mechanisms to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may result in conflicting or duplicate proposals.

3) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions (e.g., proposal, lockedFunds) without clear synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

4) Reentrancy: The execute function calls external contract function votingToken.transferFrom without proper checks for reentrancy, which can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks.

5) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a potentially gas-intensive operation by checking if the balance of the contract has exceeded a certain threshold without gas stipend, which may lead to out-of-gas exceptions.

6) Business logic flaw: The logic for determining the success of execution in the endExecute function is based on a comparison between the balance of the contract and the total supply of the votingToken, which may not accurately reflect the intended business logic.

7) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, leaving room for potential Ether leakage vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 1) incorrect visibility, 2) ID uniqueness violation, 3) inconsistent state update, 4) reentrancy, 5) insufficient gas, 6) business logic flaw, and 7) ether leakage.
