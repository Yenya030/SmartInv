Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is inherited by the TimelockController contract, but it doesn't define any of the required ERC20 functions like transfer, approve, etc. This could lead to incorrect behavior or ownership issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for the balance of the contract, but if the gas limit is reached during the function execution, the check may fail, leading to incorrect outcomes.
