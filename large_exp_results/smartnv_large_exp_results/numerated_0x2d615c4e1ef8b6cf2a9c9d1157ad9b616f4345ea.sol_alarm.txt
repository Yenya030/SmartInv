The contract you provided for analysis contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or validation, which could lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as `public` or `private`, which may lead to potential unauthorized access or manipulation of proposal data.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the loop for checking `votingToken.balanceOf` requires more gas than available, leading to potential issues in the contract execution.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
