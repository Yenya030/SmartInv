The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:
1) Business logic flaw: The function execute() allows for the transfer of funds without ensuring that the proposal has been properly approved by users, potentially leading to unauthorized fund transfers.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() allows for the updating of the lockedFunds variable without proper checks or validation, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
