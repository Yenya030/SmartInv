Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not contain any of the required functions as defined in the interface. This could lead to inconsistency in the contract state and unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the function execute(), the update to the votedAmount in the proposal struct is not properly protected by ensuring atomicity. This could lead to inconsistent state updates and potentially malicious behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: The function execute() lacks proper atomicity checks, allowing multiple transactions to manipulate the votedAmount in the proposal struct simultaneously, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The mappings lockedFunds, startingBalanceList, and proposal are not specified with any access control modifiers, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation.
