The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly specify the visibility of variables and functions, which can lead to potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount variable is updated without using proper synchronization methods, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
