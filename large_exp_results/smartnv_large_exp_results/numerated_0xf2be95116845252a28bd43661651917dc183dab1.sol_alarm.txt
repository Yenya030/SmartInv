Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- The contract is missing proper access control mechanisms for certain functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- There is a lack of input validation or checks in functions like execute and liquidate, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or business logic flaws.
- The use of integer arithmetic in functions like liquidate without checks for integer overflow or underflow may result in vulnerabilities.
- Visibility modifiers are not specified for the variables and functions, potentially leading to incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerabilities.
