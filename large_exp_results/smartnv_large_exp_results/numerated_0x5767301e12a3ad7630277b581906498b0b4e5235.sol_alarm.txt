Contract You Are Analyzing:
```solidity
contract SwapContract {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;
    uint public rate;

    function swap(uint amount) public {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        uint bAmount = amount * rate;
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, bAmount);
    }
}
```

Based on the given contract, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Arithmetic flaw: Calculation of `bAmount` may lead to arithmetic overflow if the `rate` is very large.
2) Insufficient gas: Lack of gas stipend might cause the operation to fail if the gas provided by the caller is not enough for the contract execution.
```
