The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization and could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` variable and `startingBalanceList` mapping are not specified with a visibility modifier, which could lead to potential access control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function requires checking the balance of the contract against the total supply of the token, which may require excessive gas in case of a large number of token holders.
