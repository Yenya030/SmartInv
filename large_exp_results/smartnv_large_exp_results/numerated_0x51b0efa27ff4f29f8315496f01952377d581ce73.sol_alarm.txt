The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without using a safe method like SafeMath, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not include any of the required functions like `balanceOf`, `transfer`, etc. This could lead to issues with contract visibility and ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
