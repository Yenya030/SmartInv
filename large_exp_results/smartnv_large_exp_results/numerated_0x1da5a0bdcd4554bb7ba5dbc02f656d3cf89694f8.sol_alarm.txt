Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal struct but does not use proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity in updating the state variables.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() might fail to execute successfully if the gas limit is insufficient to complete the required operations, especially when checking the balance and transferring tokens.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not explicitly defined if certain functions are meant to be external, public, or internal, risking unauthorized access to critical functionalities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
