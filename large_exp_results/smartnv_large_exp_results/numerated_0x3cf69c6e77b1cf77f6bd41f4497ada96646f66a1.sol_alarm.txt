The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

contract TokenSale {
    address public tokenAddress;

    function buyTokens(uint256 amount) external {
        require(tokenAddress != address(0), "Token address not set");
        // Transfer ETH to token address
        tokenAddress.call{value: amount}("");
    }

    function setTokenAddress(address _tokenAddress) external {
        tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Reentrancy: The call to tokenAddress in the buyTokens function can potentially allow reentrant calls if the tokenAddress is a malicious contract that triggers another function call, resulting in unexpected behavior.
- Ether leakage: If the tokenAddress is a malicious contract that does not handle incoming Ether properly, it can result in Ether being stuck in the contract or not being utilized correctly.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: Depending on the intended functionality, the visibility of tokenAddress and the permissions to setTokenAddress may need to be carefully considered to prevent unauthorized changes to the token address.
