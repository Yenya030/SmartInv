The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the owner variable, leaving it as internal. This could potentially lead to issues with ownership control and visibility.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency in the state update of the proposal struct. The execute function updates the votedAmount without any checks or validations, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves calculating the balance of the contract, which could consume a significant amount of gas. If the contract runs out of gas during this calculation, it could result in unexpected behavior.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks any explicit checks for ensuring uniqueness of proposal IDs, potentially leading to conflicts or errors in the system.
