The contract to be analyzed:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    uint public price;
    uint public totalSold;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
        totalSold = 0;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _quantity) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _quantity * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        balances[msg.sender] += _quantity;
        totalSold += _quantity;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner");
        address payable recipient = msg.sender;
        recipient.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
