The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function swapTokens(uint amountA, uint amountB) external {
        require(amountA > 0 && amountB > 0, "Cannot swap zero tokens");
        
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);
        
        tokenA.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountA);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not perform the swap of tokens atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state if one of the transfers fails after the other has succeeded.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any access control mechanisms, which could lead to unauthorized access to the swap function or token variables.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include any gas stipend for the token transfers, which could result in out-of-gas errors during the execution of the swap function for users with low gas limits.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
