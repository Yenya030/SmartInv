The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The functions `votingToken.transferFrom` and `votingToken.balanceOf` are used to update the state of the contract, but there is a possibility of inconsistent state updates if any external factors affect these operations.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` is not specified. It is essential to define the visibility of variables to ensure proper access control.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, there might be scenarios where these functions require more gas than available, leading to failed transactions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
