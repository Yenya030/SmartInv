The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function without considering the possibility of reentrancy or other state changes that may affect the accuracy of the update.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `votedProposal()` function is not specified, potentially leading to accessibility and ownership issues.
