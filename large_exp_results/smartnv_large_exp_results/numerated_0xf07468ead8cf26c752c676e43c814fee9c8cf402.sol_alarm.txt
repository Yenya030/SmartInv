The contract under analysis contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables directly within functions without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` might require a large amount of gas to execute if there are a high number of token holders, potentially leading to out of gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of some functions or variables, which can lead to unexpected access or ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
