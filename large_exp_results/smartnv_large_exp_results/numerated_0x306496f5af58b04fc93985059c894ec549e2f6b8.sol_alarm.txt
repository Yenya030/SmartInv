The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" and "startingBalanceList" variables are only accessible within the contract scope and cannot be accessed by external contracts or users. This may limit the functionality and transparency of the contract.

2) Inconsistent state update: Some state variables like "proposal.votedAmount" are updated without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data and unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The "execute" function may require a significant amount of gas due to the transfer operations, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
