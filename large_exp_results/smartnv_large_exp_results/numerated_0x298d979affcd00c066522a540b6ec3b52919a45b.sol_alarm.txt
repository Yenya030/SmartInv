In the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal state variable "owner" is not specified with a proper visibility keyword, making it inaccessible outside the contract and potentially leading to ownership control issues. 
2) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the "lockedFunds" variable without a corresponding implementation to release or utilize these locked funds, potentially causing inconsistencies in the contract state.
