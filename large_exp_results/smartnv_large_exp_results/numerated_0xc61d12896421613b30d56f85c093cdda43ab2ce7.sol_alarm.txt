<\TimelockController\>
1) Business logic flaw: The function endExecute does not check for the possibility of division by zero when calculating if the execution failed, which could potentially lead to an inconsistent state update.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the startingBalanceList without properly initializing it, potentially causing an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not define the required functions, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

<\ExchangeTokens\>
1) Price manipulation: The function liquidate allows for potential manipulation of the debt and collateral amounts based on the price returned by the getPrice() function, which could lead to fraudulent liquidation of funds.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate function performs arithmetic operations on potentially untrusted inputs (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100), which could lead to arithmetic flaws such as overflowing or underflowing.
