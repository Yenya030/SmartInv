The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: the contract does not seem to have a mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals or addresses, which can lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts.
2) Insufficient gas: the contract may run out of gas during execution as there are several operations that require significant gas, such as transferring tokens or performing calculations.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation and insufficient gas.
