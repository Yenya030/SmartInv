The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the state variables without proper synchronization, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution, causing transactions to fail or leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
