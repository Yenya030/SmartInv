Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The deposit function allows anyone to deposit funds as long as they have the buyer's address, which could lead to unauthorized deposits.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is no check to ensure that the release or refund functions are only called once the corresponding conditions are met, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.
