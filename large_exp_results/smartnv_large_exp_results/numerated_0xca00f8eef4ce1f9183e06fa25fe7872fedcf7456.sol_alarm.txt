Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract: 
1) privilege escalation - The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling critical functions.
2) inconsistent state update - There are instances where state variables are updated without proper checks or validations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
3) integer overflow/underflow - There are calculations involving uint variables without overflow/underflow checks, which could result in unexpected outcomes if the values exceed the maximum or minimum range.
4) atomicity violation - Certain functions perform multiple state changes without utilizing appropriate synchronization mechanisms, leading to potential race conditions.
