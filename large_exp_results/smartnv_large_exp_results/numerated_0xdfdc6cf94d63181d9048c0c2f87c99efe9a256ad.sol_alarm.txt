The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;

    enum State {AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE, REFUNDED}
    State public currentState;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = _amount;
        currentState = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;
    }

    function releaseAmountToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Incorrect state for release");
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
        // transfer funds to seller
    }

    function refundAmountToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund funds");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Incorrect state for refund");
        currentState = State.REFUNDED;
        // transfer funds back to buyer
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions `releaseAmountToSeller` and `refundAmountToBuyer` should have additional access control measures to ensure that only the arbiter can call them.
- Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of transitioning to an incorrect state if the `currentState` is not properly checked before changing it.
- Privilege escalation: The arbiter has significant authority in the contract, which may lead to cases of privilege escalation if not handled carefully.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and privilege escalation.
