Contract you are analyzing:
contract Crowdsale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public investors;
    uint public totalInvestment;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function invest(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        investors[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalInvestment += amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
} 

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
