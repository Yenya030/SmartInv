This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of ID uniqueness violation in the contract as there are no checks or mechanisms in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not specified with an access modifier, which can lead to visibility or ownership issues.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, such as execute(), due to the lack of gas optimization.
4) Atomicity violation: The execution of the execute() function is not atomic and can lead to inconsistent state updates if any of the require statements fail after the transferFrom operation.
5) Inconsistent state update: The implementation of the execute() function may lead to inconsistent state updates as the votedAmount is updated before calling the votedProposal() function, potentially causing discrepancies in the contract's state.
