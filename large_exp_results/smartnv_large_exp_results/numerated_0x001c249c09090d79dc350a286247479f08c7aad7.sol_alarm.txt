The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is called in the `execute` function, but `votedProposal` is not defined in the contract, potentially leading to a visibility issue if it is supposed to be an internal or external function.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `endExecute` function, the `lockedFunds` variable is updated based on the balance of the contract, but there doesn't seem to be any logic or condition that ensures the correct calculation of `lockedFunds`.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function involves a transfer operation (`votingToken.transferFrom`) which may require significant gas fees. If the caller does not provide enough gas, the transaction may fail due to insufficient gas.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is mentioned but not defined in the contract. If this function is meant to validate the uniqueness of proposals or votes, its absence could lead to a violation of ID uniqueness.
