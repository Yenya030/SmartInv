Potential vulnerabilities in the contract to be analyzed:

1) Inconsistent state update: the `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistencies.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the `lockedFunds` variable is modified externally in the `endExecute` function, which might not have the appropriate visibility or ownership control.

3) Atomicity violation: operations within the `startExecute` and `endExecute` functions are not atomic, which could result in unexpected behavior if multiple transactions interact with the contract concurrently.

4) Insufficient gas: the contract does not consider gas limitations for complex operations, which may lead to out-of-gas errors in certain scenarios.

5) ID uniqueness violation: there is no mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could result in conflicts or ambiguities.

6) Ether leakage: the contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, potentially leading to Ether leakage or loss.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, and ether leakage.
