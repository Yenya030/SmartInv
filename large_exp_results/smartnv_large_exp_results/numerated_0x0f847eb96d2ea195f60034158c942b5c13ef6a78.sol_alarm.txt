The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables `startingBalanceList`, `lockedFunds`, and `proposal` is not specified, which can lead to potential security issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency in the state update of the `proposal.votedAmount` variable, as it is updated without proper synchronization mechanisms.
3) Insufficient gas: If the `execute` function requires a large amount of gas to execute, there is a possibility of running out of gas and causing the function to revert, leading to incomplete execution.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier, which can lead to potential conflicts and vulnerabilities in the system.
