The contract you provided is:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    address internal owner;

    function vote(uint _proposalId) public {
        require(votes[msg.sender] == 0, "Already voted");
        votes[msg.sender] = _proposalId;
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change owner");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- privilege escalation: The `changeOwner` function allows the owner to be changed by any address, not just the current owner.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, meaning it can be accessed by external contracts, which may lead to unauthorized access and manipulation.
