Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct without any synchronization mechanism. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal at the same time.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not define any of the required functions specified in the interface. This could lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect the IERC20 interface to be properly implemented.
