Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions, which can lead to potential security risks.
- Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the contract's functions and the operations performed, there may be instances where insufficient gas is provided, leading to function failures or unexpected behavior.
