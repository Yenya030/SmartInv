The contract above contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) privilege escalation: 
- The contract does not implement access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users, which could lead to privilege escalation.

2) inconsistent state update: 
- The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) atomicity violation: 
- The `execute` function transfers tokens and updates the `proposal.votedAmount` variable separately, which could lead to atomicity violations if one operation fails while the other succeeds.

4) reentrancy: 
- The contract does not implement mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks, leaving it vulnerable to reentrancy exploits.

5) incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The contract does not specify the visibility or ownership of certain variables and functions, which could lead to unexpected access or manipulation.
