This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined with a visibility modifier, which could lead to incorrect ownership or visibility concerns.
3) Insufficient gas: There might be potential gas issues depending on the gas consumption of the functions.
4) Arithmetic flaw: There are arithmetic operations in the `execute` function that may lead to arithmetic flaws if not handled carefully.
