Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect state update: The code does not properly update the `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function, as it directly assigns the balance of the contract instead of considering any executed logic.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The code does not ensure uniqueness of `proposal.addr` when creating a new proposal, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limitations that could potentially result in transaction failures or incomplete executions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and insufficient gas handling.
