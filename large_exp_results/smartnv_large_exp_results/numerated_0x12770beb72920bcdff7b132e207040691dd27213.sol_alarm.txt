Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract's address, but there is no indication of how this information is used or secured, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The startExecute() function allows any address to initiate a new proposal without proper authorization, potentially leading to privilege escalation issues.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the required functions to comply with the interface, indicating a possible incorrect visibility or ownership vulnerability.
