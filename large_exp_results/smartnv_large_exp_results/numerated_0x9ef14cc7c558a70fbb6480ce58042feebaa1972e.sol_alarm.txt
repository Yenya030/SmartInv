The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `votingToken`, making them publicly accessible.
2) Mixing view and non-view functions: The `calculatePrice` function in the contract modifies the state by transferring tokens but is marked as view, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks a condition using `balanceOf(address(this))*2 > totalSupply()` which may not accurately represent the desired logic.
