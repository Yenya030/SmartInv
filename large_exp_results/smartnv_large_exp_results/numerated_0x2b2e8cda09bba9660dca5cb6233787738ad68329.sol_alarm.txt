The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() modifies the state of the proposal struct without properly initialising it, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The startExecute() function allows any caller to initiate a proposal without proper permission controls, leading to privilege escalation vulnerability. 

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, internal, etc.) for the proposal struct, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of the data.
