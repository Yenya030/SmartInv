Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the state variables without appropriate checks or validations, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not explicitly mentioned, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities related to access control.
