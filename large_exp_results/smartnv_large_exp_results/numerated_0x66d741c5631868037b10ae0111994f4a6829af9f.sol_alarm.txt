Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract's state may be inconsistently updated in the `execute` function where `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without using a proper atomic operation, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not check for the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could result in conflicts and data integrity issues.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of functions like `endExecute` which involves transferring tokens or checking token balances, leading to incomplete transactions.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions in the contract is not specified, which can create ambiguity and potential security vulnerabilities related to access control.
