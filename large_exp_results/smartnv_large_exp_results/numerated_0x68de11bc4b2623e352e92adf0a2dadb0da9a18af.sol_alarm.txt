The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:
- Insufficient gas
- Atomicity violation

Explanation:

The function `votedProposal(proposal)` in the `execute` function seems to be calling an external function (not provided in the code snippet) to process the voted proposal. If this external function requires a substantial amount of gas to execute, there is a risk of running out of gas during the contract execution, leading to an insufficient gas vulnerability. 

Additionally, the operations in the `execute` function involve multiple steps (transferring tokens and updating the proposal's state). If any step fails, it could leave the contract in an inconsistent state, violating the atomicity principle. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are insufficient gas and atomicity violation.
