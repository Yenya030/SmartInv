The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update:
   - The function `startExecute()` updates the state of `proposal` without checking if the proposal is already in progress, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation:
   - The function `execute()` involves multiple state updates without being wrapped in a single transaction, which can lead to atomicity violations.

3) Incorrect visibility:
   - The variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, and `startingBalanceList` are not specified with any visibility modifier, which can lead to issues related to incorrect visibility.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Atomicity violation, and Incorrect visibility.
