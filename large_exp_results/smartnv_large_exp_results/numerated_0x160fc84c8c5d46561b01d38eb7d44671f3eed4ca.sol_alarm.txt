The contract that needs to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
     IERC20 public token;
     address public owner;

     constructor(address _token) {
         token = IERC20(_token);
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _amount) external {
         require(token.balanceOf(owner) >= _amount, "Not enough tokens available");
         token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
     }

     function withdrawTokens(uint _amount) external {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw tokens");
         token.transfer(owner, _amount);
     }
}
```

Please identify potential vulnerabilities in the above contract.
