The following contract may contain potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `startingBlance` is spelled incorrectly as `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` in the `startExecute` function. This could lead to unintended behavior or errors in the contract logic.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier for each proposal. If multiple proposals are created by different users at the same time, it could lead to confusion or conflicts in the contract.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as `internal`, which may not provide the appropriate access control or visibility level for managing ownership of the contract. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
