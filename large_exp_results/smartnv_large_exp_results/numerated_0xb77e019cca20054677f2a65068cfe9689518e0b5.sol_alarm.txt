Vulnerabilities:
3) business logic flaw: The release function does not involve the arbiter in the release of funds, even though the arbiter is defined in the contract.
7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique identification of parties, which could lead to identity confusion or misuse.
