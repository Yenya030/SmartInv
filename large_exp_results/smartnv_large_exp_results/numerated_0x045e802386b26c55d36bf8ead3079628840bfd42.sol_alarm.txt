The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function but is never used or reset, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define or implement any of the functions required by the interface, which may result in incorrect visibility or ownership of functions.
