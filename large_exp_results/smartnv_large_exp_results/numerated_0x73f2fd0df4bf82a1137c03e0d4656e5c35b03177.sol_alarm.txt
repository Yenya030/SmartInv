Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: In the function calculatePrice(), there is a potential for integer overflow if the result of the division operation exceeds the maximum uint value.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables debt and collateral are declared as public which may expose sensitive user data. Consider using appropriate access modifiers like private or internal.
