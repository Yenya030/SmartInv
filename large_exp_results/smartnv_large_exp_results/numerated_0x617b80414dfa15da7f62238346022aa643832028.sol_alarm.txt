Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which may not provide the intended access control.
2) Inconsistent state update: The startingBlance variable is misspelled, leading to potential unintended behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: The execution of the execute function may not be atomic due to the lack of locking mechanisms, potentially leading to race conditions.
4) Insufficient gas: If the contract relies on external calls, insufficient gas may prevent the successful execution of certain functions.
5) Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws in the implementation of the startExecute and endExecute functions that could lead to unexpected behavior.
6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, but if it were required, there is a potential for unintended Ether leakage.
