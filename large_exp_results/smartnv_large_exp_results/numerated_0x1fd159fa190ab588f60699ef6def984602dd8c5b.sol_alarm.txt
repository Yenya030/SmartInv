The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Marketplace {
         address public owner;
         mapping(uint => uint) public products;

         constructor() public {
            owner = msg.sender;
         }

         function addProduct(uint id, uint price) public {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can add products");
            products[id] = price;
         }

         function buyProduct(uint id) public payable {
            require(products[id] != 0, "Product does not exist");
            require(msg.value >= products[id], "Insufficient funds");
            address payable _owner = address(uint160(owner));
            _owner.transfer(products[id]);
            // Transfer ownership of the product to the buyer
            owner = msg.sender;
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract are:

4) inconsistent state update
8) reentrancy
