The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without checking if it is appropriately updated or used elsewhere in the contract. This can lead to inconsistencies in the data stored in the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface, but it does not provide the necessary functions required by the interface. This can lead to incorrect visibility of functions or ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
