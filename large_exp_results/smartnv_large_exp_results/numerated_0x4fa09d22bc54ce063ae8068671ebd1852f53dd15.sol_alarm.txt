Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the `proposal` struct to store proposal information, but certain functions like `startExecute()` and `endExecute()` do not consistently update or check the state of the proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent or unintended behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which might lead to potential vulnerability if the intention was to restrict access to certain functions or variables using the `owner` variable.

3) Insufficient gas: There is no explicit handling of gas limits in the contract, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during transactions that require more gas than available.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations like `proposal.votedAmount += amount` which could potentially lead to integer overflow if the voted amount exceeds the maximum value for the data type used.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior if multiple entities share the same identifier.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions explicitly, but if there are any ether transactions involved, there might be potential vulnerabilities related to ether leakage or improper handling of ether.

7) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have any mechanism to prevent or handle suicidal (self-destruct) actions, which could potentially lead to the contract being destroyed and funds becoming inaccessible.

8) Privilege escalation: There might be potential vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation if certain functions are accessible to unauthorized or unintended users, allowing them to perform actions beyond their intended privileges.
