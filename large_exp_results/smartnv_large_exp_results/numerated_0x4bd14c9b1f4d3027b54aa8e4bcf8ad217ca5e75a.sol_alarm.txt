The contract you provided seems to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `votingToken` variable, which may lead to potential issues with contract visibility and ownership.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated within the `execute` and `endExecute` functions, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract against the total supply of the `votingToken`, which may require significant gas usage and could result in insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.

4) Business logic flaw: The `execute` function relies on a condition `require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through")`, which may be prone to business logic flaws depending on the context of the application.

Please ensure to thoroughly review and address these potential vulnerabilities in the contract.
