Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `lockedFunds` and `startingBalanceList` are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization or validation checks, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions like `endExecute`, especially if the gas limit is not set high enough, leading to incomplete execution and potential issues.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables `owner`, `votingToken`, and the struct `Proposal` is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation by external contracts or users.
