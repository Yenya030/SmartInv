The contract you provided has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) atomicity violation: The function `endExecute()` does multiple state changes without using proper atomic operations, which can lead to inconsistent state updates in case of reentrancy or interruption.

2) insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a gas-intensive operation within a require statement, which can lead to out-of-gas errors and prevent the function from executing successfully.

3) inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is directly incremented in the `execute()` function without proper checking or validation, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates or unauthorized vote manipulation.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, internal, external) for some of its functions, which can lead to unintended behavior or accessibility issues.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, insufficient gas, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
