Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without properly checking if an existing proposal is already ongoing.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20, but it should implement and use the functions defined in the interface correctly to avoid inconsistency.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
