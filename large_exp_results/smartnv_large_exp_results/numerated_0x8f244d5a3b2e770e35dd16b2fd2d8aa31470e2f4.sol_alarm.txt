Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as public in the `ExchangeTokens` contract, potentially exposing sensitive information to all external parties.
