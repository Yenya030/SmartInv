The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The deposit and withdraw functions only check the sender's address but do not utilize the 'msg.sender' correctly to check the ownership. This can potentially lead to privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'locked' state is being updated without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates in certain scenarios.
