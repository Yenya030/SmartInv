Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function based on the balance of the contract, but this does not ensure that the contract is in a consistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations, which can result in the function not performing as intended.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is defined as internal, which may lead to potential issues with ownership control and visibility within the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
