The contract provided for analysis is:

contract SimpleContract {
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;

    function mint(uint amount) public {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the SimpleContract are:
1) Integer Overflow: The totalSupply variable could potentially overflow if the mint function is called with a very large amount.
2) Inconsistent State Update: If an exception is thrown after totalSupply is increased but before the balanceOf is updated in the mint function, the contract's state will be inconsistent.
3) Insufficient Gas: If the transfer function requires a large amount of gas to update the balanceOf mappings, it could fail to execute due to insufficient gas.
4) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: Depending on the context of the contract, the visibility of totalSupply and balanceOf variables might need to be restricted for security reasons. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the SimpleContract are Integer Overflow, Inconsistent State Update, Insufficient Gas, and Incorrect Visibility/Ownership.
