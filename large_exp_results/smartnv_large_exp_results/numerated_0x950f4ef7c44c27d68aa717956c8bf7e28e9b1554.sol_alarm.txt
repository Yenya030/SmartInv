The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBlance` variable is used without defining its visibility, which could lead to unintended behavior.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
