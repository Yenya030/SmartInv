The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is no check to ensure that the votingToken.transferFrom is successful before updating the proposal.votedAmount.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement IERC20 interface but does not actually define the required functions.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController does not specify the visibility of the proposal struct.
