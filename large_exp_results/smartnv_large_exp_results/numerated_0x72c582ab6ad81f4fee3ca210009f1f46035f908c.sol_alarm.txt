Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The "liquidate" function in the ExchangeTokens contract could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if the transfer operations fail after updating the debt and collateral mappings. This could result in funds being transferred without updating the corresponding debt or collateral amounts, causing inconsistencies in the contract state.
- Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the "liquidate" function may be prone to arithmetic flaws if the values of getPrice(), cAmount, and dAmount are not carefully validated before performing the computation. This could lead to unexpected results or vulnerabilities such as integer overflow/underflow.
