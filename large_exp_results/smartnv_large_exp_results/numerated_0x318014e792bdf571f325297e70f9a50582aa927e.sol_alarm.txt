Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

2) Privilege escalation: The execute function allows the sender to transfer tokens and update the voted amount without adequate checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
4) Inconsistent state update: The endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract, which can be manipulated by external factors, leading to inconsistent state updates.
