<\example_1\> 
1) Inconsistent state update: The startingBalanceList is updated in the startExecute function without any condition checks or validation.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to ensure unique identification of proposals, which may lead to conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.

<\example_2\>
1) Price manipulation: The liquidate function does not consider potential price manipulation through the getPrice() function, which can lead to incorrect liquidation calculations.
2) Atomicity violation: The transfer of USDC and WETH tokens in the liquidate function is not done atomically, which can result in inconsistencies if one transfer fails while the other succeeds.

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure its security.
