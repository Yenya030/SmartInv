Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state without any consideration for the ongoing state of proposals, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which may not properly restrict access to sensitive functions or data.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function includes a gas-intensive operation (checking balance compared to total supply) which may lead to out of gas exceptions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, potentially leading to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
