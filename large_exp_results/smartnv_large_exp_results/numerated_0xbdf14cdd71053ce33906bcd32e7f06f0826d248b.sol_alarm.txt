The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of synchronization in updating the state variables within the functions, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data stored.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of the contract functions and variables are not clearly defined, potentially allowing unauthorized access to critical functions and data.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, leading to incomplete or failed transactions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
