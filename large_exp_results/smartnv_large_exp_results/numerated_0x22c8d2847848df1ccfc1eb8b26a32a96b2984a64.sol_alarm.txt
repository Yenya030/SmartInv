The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as it is checking if the value of collateral is less than 80% of the debt amount, which could potentially allow for liquidation without proper validation.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract is public, which may not be necessary and could expose sensitive information to external parties.
