The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without checking if it has already been set elsewhere in the contract. This can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal()` function is referenced in the code snippet, but it is not included in the contract. This could potentially indicate incorrect visibility or ownership of functions in the contract.
