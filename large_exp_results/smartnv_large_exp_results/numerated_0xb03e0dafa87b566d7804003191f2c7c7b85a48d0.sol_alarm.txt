This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute(uint256 amount)` updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without properly handling synchronization or atomicity concerns, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` may fail to execute if the gas limit is exceeded due to potentially consuming too much gas when checking the condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`.
