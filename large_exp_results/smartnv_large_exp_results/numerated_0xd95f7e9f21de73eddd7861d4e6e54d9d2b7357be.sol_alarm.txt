1) Inconsistent state update: The update of 'proposal.votedAmount' in the 'execute' function is not atomic and could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions attempt to update it simultaneously.

1) Price manipulation: The comparison in the 'liquidate' function where the debt amount is compared against 80% of the product of collateral amount and price can be manipulated if the 'calculatePrice' function is manipulated.
2) Insufficient gas: If the 'calculatePrice' function consumes too much gas, it could lead to the 'liquidate' function failing due to insufficient gas.
