The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` mapping are not specified with any visibility modifier, potentially causing issues with data access and manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a considerable amount of gas due to the possibly large loop in the `require` statement, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
