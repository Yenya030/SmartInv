The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` field of the `proposal` struct without properly managing concurrency, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute if there is not enough gas supplied to complete the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
