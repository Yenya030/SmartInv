Contract to be analyzed:
<\example_3\>
contract Crowdsale {
         address public owner;
         IERC20 public token;
         uint public rate;
         
         constructor(address _owner, IERC20 _token, uint _rate) {
             owner = _owner;
             token = _token;
             rate = _rate;
         }
         
         function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
             uint cost = amount * rate;
             require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cost, "insufficient balance");
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), cost);
             token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         }
}
<\example_3\> 

Output:
- Business logic flaw: The calculation of cost in the buyTokens function may lead to incorrect token transfer amounts due to the multiplication of amount and rate.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable and constructor in the Crowdsale contract are public, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- Inconsistent state update: The transfer of tokens in the buyTokens function may lead to inconsistencies in the contract state if the token transfers fail for any reason.
