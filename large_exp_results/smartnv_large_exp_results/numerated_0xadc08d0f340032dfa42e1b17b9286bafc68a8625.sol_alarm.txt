The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - In the function startExecute(), the startingBalanceList is updated without clear initialization.
2) ID uniqueness violation:
   - There is no check for uniqueness of proposals, which could lead to conflicts or overwriting of data.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined or enforced, leaving it open to potential unauthorized access.
