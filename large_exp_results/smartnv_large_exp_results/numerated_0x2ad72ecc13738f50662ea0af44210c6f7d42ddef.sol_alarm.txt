The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can change ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
2) Reentrancy

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are potentially incorrect visibility/ownership and reentrancy vulnerabilities.
