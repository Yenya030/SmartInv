Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" in the Proposal struct is directly incremented without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The "votedAmount" in the Proposal struct is incremented without using any locks or atomic operations, potentially leading to race conditions and incorrect updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the necessary functions to fulfill the interface requirements, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership of the contract's functions and data.
