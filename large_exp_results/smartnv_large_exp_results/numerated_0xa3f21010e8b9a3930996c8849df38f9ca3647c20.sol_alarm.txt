The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: In the startExecute function, the startingBalanceList mapping is updated without any check to ensure that the proposal.addr value is valid or has been initialized properly. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if proposal.addr is not a valid address.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not explicitly set as private or public, which can lead to potential visibility issues if it needs to be accessed by external contracts.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function's logic to check if the execution is successful by comparing the balance of the contract with the total supply of the voting token could require excessive gas if the total supply is large, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
