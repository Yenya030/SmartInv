The following contract may have potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` struct, `Proposal` struct features in the `TimelockController` contract, which could lead to potential security issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is an inconsistent state update in the `execute` function of the `TimelockController` contract, where the `votedAmount` of the `proposal` is updated without proper synchronization measures, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function of the `TimelockController` contract may have insufficient gas provided, especially when checking the condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could potentially cause the function to fail unexpectedly.
