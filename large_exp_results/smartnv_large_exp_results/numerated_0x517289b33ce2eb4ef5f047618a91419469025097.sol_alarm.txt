The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as it does not seem to properly handle the calculation of cAmount compared to dAmount for liquidation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have an inconsistent state update issue as it transfers tokens based on a condition that may not be properly validated.
3) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have an arithmetic flaw as it divides two balanceOf() results without validating if the denominator could be zero.
