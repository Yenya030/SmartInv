The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable "proposal" without fully initializing it, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the necessary functions required by the interface, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() performs a potentially expensive operation by checking if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply, which may require excessive gas and lead to insufficient gas error.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
