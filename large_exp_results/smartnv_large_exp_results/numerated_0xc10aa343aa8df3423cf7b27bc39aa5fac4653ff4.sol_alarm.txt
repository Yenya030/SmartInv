The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalVotes = 0;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can change the owner");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

Based on the contract provided, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) privilege escalation: The `changeOwner` function allows the current owner to change the ownership to another address, potentially leading to privilege escalation if unauthorized users gain access to this function.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is set as public, exposing the ownership information publicly, which may not be desired in all situations.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation and incorrect visibility/ownership.
