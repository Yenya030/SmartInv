The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: In the function `endExecute`, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might have a business logic flaw as it is checking for a condition that may not make sense in the context of the contract.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not have any mechanisms in place to handle situations where there might be insufficient gas for executing transactions. This could potentially lead to transaction failures or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw and insufficient gas.
