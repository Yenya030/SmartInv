Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

3) business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw regarding the calculation of whether a user's funds can be liquidated.

5) atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the liquidate function of the ExchangeTokens contract, as the transferFrom operations for USDC and WETH are not performed atomically.

14) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract may be incorrect as it is marked as public, but it does not seem to interact with external parties.
