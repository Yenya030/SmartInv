The contract provided for analysis: 

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities found in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal' struct seems to be missing state information required to persist across different function calls, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as internal but seems to be unused, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or lack of proper ownership control.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no apparent mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposals or addresses, which could lead to conflicts or collisions.
4) Business logic flaw: The business logic involving proposal execution and ending might be susceptible to flaws or inconsistencies that could impact the contract's intended behavior.
