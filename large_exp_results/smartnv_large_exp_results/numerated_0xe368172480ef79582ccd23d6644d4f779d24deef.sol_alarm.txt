The contract provided below contains potential vulnerabilities:

contract Vault {
     address public owner;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
     function deposit() public payable {
         balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }
    
     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
         require(success, "Transfer failed");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
     }
    
     function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
         owner = newOwner;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Vault contract are:

1) privilege escalation
2) improper handling of transfer failure
3) inconsistent state update
4) incorrect visibility/ownership
