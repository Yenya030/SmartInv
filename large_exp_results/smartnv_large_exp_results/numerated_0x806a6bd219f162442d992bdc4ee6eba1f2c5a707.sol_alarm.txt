Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without checking if the conditions for ending execution are met. This could lead to incorrect state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is internal, which means that it cannot be accessed by external contracts or accounts. Depending on the intended usage, this could be a vulnerability.
