The contract you provided has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: 
- In the startExecute function, the startingBalanceList mapping is updated directly without protecting against re-entrancy or ensuring atomicity.

2) privilege escalation: 
- The startExecute function allows any address to potentially start a new proposal without proper authorization checks.

3) insufficient gas:
- The endExecute function may fail due to running out of gas while iterating through all addresses to check for a condition.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, and insufficient gas.
