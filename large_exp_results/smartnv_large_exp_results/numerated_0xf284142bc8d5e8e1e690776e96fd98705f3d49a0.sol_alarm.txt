Given the provided contract, here are the potential vulnerabilities identified:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure unique identifiers for proposals, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in managing multiple proposals.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for a variable holding owner address. This could lead to issues related to contract ownership and access control.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function performs multiple state changes without using proper atomicity measures, which could result in inconsistent or partially executed transactions.

4) Inconsistent state update: The `execute()` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without any check on the maximum amount that can be voted, potentially leading to inconsistent state or unexpected behavior.

5) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of explicit gas management in the contract, which could result in out-of-gas errors during the execution of complex operations.

6) Business logic flaw: The condition in the `endExecute()` function for checking if execution failed (`require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`) seems ambiguous and could potentially lead to unintended outcomes.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are ID uniqueness violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and a business logic flaw.
