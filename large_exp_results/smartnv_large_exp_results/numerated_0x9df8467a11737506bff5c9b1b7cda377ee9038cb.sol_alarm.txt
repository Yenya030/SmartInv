The contract given for analysis is:

contract VotingSystem {
     address public admin;
     mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
     uint public totalVotes;

     constructor() {
          admin = msg.sender;
          totalVotes = 0;
     }

     function vote() public {
          require(hasVoted[msg.sender] == false, "Already voted");
          hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
          totalVotes++;
     }

     function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
          require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
          admin = newAdmin;
     }
}
