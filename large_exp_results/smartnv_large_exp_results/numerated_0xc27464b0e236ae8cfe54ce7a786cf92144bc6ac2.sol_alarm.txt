The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which could potentially lead to issues related to visibility and ownership.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to insufficient gas if the gas limit is reached before the function execution is completed.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Insufficient gas.
