This contract is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function by directly adding the transferred amount. This could lead to inconsistency in the state if multiple transfers are made simultaneously.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` is updated in the `startExecute` function, but it could potentially be manipulated from outside sources, leading to inconsistency in the data stored.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of `proposal.addr`. This could potentially lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals have the same address.

4) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes happening in the `execute` function without using any atomicity mechanism, which could lead to incomplete or inconsistent updates if an error occurs during the function execution. 

5) Business logic flaw: The check `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function seems to have a flawed business logic, as it is not clear what the intended comparison is trying to achieve.

Overall, this contract has multiple potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to manipulate the state or behavior of the system.
