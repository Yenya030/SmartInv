Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

3) business logic flaw: The execute function allows for the transfer of tokens and updating the voted amount without proper verification mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized execution of actions.

5) atomicity violation: The endExecute function lacks atomicity in checking and updating variables, which could result in inconsistent state updates during the execution.

7) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, potentially leading to confusion or conflicts in the system.
