The contract to analyze:

contract CrossBridge {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) public {
        require(token != address(0), "Invalid token address");
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");

        balances[token] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) public {
        require(token != address(0), "Invalid token address");
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(balances[token] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[token] -= amount;
    }

    function transfer(address token, address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(token != address(0), "Invalid token address");
        require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(balances[token] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[token] -= amount;
        balances[token] += amount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the CrossBridge contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The transfer function does not correctly handle transferring the amount to the recipient, as it subtracts from the sender's balance but does not add to the recipient's balance.
2) ID uniqueness violation: To avoid potential conflicts, it's important to ensure that the addresses used as token or recipient are unique and not null values.
