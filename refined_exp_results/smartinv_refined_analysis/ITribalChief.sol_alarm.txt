Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated after transferring tokens in the `execute` function. This could lead to an inconsistent state if the token transfer fails.
- Atomicity violation: The state updates in the `execute` function are not enclosed within a single transaction, which could lead to atomicity violations.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique proposal IDs, which could lead to duplicate proposals being created and processed.
