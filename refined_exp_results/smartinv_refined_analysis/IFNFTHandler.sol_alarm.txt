The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The execute function allows the transfer of tokens and update of votedAmount without verifying the sender's authority, leading to potential privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal state (votedAmount) without ensuring that the operation is atomic, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The startExecute function does not ensure that each proposal is unique, which may potentially violate the uniqueness of proposal IDs and lead to confusion or unexpected behavior.
