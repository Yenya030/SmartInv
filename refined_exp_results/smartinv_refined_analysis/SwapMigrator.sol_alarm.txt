Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The "execute" function does not properly handle the case where the proposal has already received votes, potentially allowing for undesired behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential issue with the updating of the "votedAmount" in the "execute" function, as it could lead to inconsistent or incorrect state.
3) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the updating of the "votedAmount" in the "execute" function, which could lead to issues if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or confusion in tracking proposals.
