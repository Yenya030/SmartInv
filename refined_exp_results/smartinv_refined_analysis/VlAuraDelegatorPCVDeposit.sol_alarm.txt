The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how this variable is being used or what impact it has on the contract's state.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `Proposal` struct does not seem to have a unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to issues with tracking and managing multiple proposals.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `votingToken` contract being used in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions could potentially have inconsistency issues if the contract state is not synchronized properly across the bridge.

4) Business logic flaw: The `require` statement in the `endExecute` function to check if the execution has ended based on a 24-hour timeline could be flawed if the time calculation is not accurate or if there are edge cases that are not properly handled.
