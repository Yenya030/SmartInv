The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state variables proposal.votedAmount and proposal.addr without using the correct locking mechanism, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The function execute performs multiple state changes in a sequence without proper atomicity checks, which may result in unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails.
3) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions, allowing potential privilege escalation attacks.
