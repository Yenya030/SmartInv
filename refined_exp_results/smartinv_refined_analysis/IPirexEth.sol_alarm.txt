The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that the `proposal.addr` has actually approved the transfer of tokens. This could lead to an inconsistent state where tokens are transferred without proper authorization.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `startExecute` function creates a new `Proposal` struct without checking if a proposal with the same `proposal.addr` already exists. This could lead to ID uniqueness violations if multiple proposals are created for the same address.

3) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, leaving room for potential issues if one of the operations fails after another one has already been executed.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and atomicity violation.
