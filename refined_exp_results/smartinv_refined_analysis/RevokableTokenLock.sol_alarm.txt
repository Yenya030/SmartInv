The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `proposal` struct without considering potential race conditions or validation checks before updating the state. This can lead to inconsistent state updates and potentially result in errors or unexpected behavior.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state-changing operations (transferFrom, assignment, function call) without wrapping them in a single atomic operation. This can lead to atomicity violations where the state changes are not executed in a single step, potentially opening up vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of `votingToken` held in the contract. However, there is no synchronization mechanism to ensure consistency between the internal state of the contract and the external state of `votingToken`, which can lead to cross bridge inconsistencies and inaccurate calculations.
