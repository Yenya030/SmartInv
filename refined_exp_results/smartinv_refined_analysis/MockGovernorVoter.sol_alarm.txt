Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The startExecute function updates the state of the proposal and startingBalanceList but does not update the state of the startingBalanceList correctly, potentially leading to inconsistent states.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The proposal struct does not have any unique identifier for each proposal, which may lead to issues with identifying and managing multiple proposals.
