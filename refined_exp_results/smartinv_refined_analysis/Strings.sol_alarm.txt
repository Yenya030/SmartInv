Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the `startExecute` function to be called by any external address, potentially leading to unauthorized parties initiating proposals and executing transactions.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update as the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The uniqueness of proposal ID is not enforced, which may result in conflicting proposals with the same ID being processed simultaneously, causing unexpected results in the execution process.
