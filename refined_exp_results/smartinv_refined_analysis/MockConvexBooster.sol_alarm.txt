The contract provided in the prompt appears to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without ensuring atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent data state.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The address of the proposal creator (msg.sender) is used as an identifier for the proposal, which may lead to ID duplication issues if multiple proposals are created by the same address.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided contract snippet and may not cover all possible vulnerabilities.
