Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state without checking if a previous proposal is still ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent states.
2) Privilege escalation: The `proposal` struct is public and can be modified by anyone calling the functions, which could lead to unauthorized changes in the contract state.
3) Atomicity violation: There is no use of locks or mechanisms to ensure atomicity in the contract's state updates, which could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple transactions attempt to update the state simultaneously.
