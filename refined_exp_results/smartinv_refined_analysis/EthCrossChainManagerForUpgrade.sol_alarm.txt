Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal ID, which could lead to confusion or incorrect processing of proposals.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent states.
- Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does not ensure atomicity of state changes, which could result in unexpected behavior if multiple transactions try to interact with the same proposal simultaneously.
