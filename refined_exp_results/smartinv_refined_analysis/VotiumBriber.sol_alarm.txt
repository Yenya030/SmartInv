Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for changing the state of the proposal in the execute function without ensuring atomicity, which can lead to inconsistent states.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract relies on external calls to transfer tokens in the execute function, which can result in inconsistencies or failures due to external dependencies.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

4) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function has a condition that checks if the locked funds are greater than half of the total supply, which may not always be a valid business logic for execution.
