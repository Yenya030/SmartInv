Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execution function in the TimelockController contract updates the votedAmount of the proposal without checking if the transfer of tokens is successful. This can lead to an inconsistent state if the transfer fails after incrementing the votedAmount.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is no validation or verification mechanism for the data being passed between functions or contracts. This lack of data consistency checking can lead to cross bridge inconsistencies if the data passed is malicious or incorrect.
