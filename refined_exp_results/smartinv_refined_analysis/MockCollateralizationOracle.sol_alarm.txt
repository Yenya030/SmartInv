Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract at that moment, which may lead to inconsistent state if there are any further changes in the contract balance after this calculation.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The startExecute function relies on the getStartingBalance function to retrieve the starting balance of the proposal address, potentially introducing inconsistencies if the getStartingBalance function interacts with external contracts that may change the balance dynamically.
