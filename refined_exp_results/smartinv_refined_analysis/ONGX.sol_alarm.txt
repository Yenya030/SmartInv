This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state without ensuring that all necessary conditions are met, which can lead to inconsistent data.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract uses external data from getStartingBalance function without proper validation, which can result in inconsistencies between the bridge data and the contract data.
3) Privilege escalation: The contract does not properly check for the owner's privilege before allowing certain functions to be executed, opening up the possibility of privilege escalation attacks.
