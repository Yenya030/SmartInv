Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent or unexpected state changes.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of multiple state variables and functions without proper synchronization can lead to cross bridge inconsistencies, where data is not properly shared or updated between different parts of the contract.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any implementation related to unique identifiers for proposals or other entities, which could potentially lead to ID duplication and conflicts.

4) Business logic flaw: The logic implemented in the functions may not cover all edge cases and scenarios, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in certain situations.
