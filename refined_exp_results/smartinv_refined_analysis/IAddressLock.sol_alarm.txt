Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or atomicity, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `voteProposal` function or any other function that interacts with proposals does not ensure that the proposal IDs are unique, which can result in conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of validation or security measures to ensure the consistency between different parts of the contract or external dependencies, leading to potential cross bridge inconsistencies.

It is important to address these vulnerabilities to ensure the security and integrity of the contract's functionalities.
