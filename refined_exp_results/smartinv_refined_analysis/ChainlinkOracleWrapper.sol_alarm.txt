The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the `votedAmount` at the same time.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have any unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are created simultaneously or if there is a need to distinguish between different proposals.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract relies on external calls to `votingToken.transferFrom` and `votedProposal`, which can introduce cross-bridge inconsistencies if these external calls fail or behave unexpectedly.

4) Atomicity violation: The operations within the functions `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` are not wrapped in a single transaction, which could potentially lead to atomicity violations if one of the operations fails midway.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, cross bridge inconsistency, and atomicity violation.
