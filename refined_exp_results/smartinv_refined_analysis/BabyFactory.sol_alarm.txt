Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not account for potential inconsistencies in state updates, such as in the `execute` function where the `votedAmount` is updated without proper synchronization which may lead to incorrect behavior.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or proposals, which could potentially lead to conflicts or unintended behavior in the system. 

Please review and update the contract to address these vulnerabilities.
