The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the "execute" function updates the state variable "proposal.votedAmount" without proper synchronization or atomicity measures, which could lead to inconsistent state updates under concurrent calls.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The "startExecute" function sets the "proposal" struct with the block.timestamp and msg.sender address, which might not guarantee uniqueness for proposal identifiers, leading to potential conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
