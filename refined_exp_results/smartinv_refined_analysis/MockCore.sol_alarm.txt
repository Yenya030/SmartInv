Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is updated directly in the 'execute' function without properly checking and handling the state of the proposal. This could lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Atomicity violation: The 'execute' function does multiple state changes without using proper atomic operations or checks. This could result in partial execution of the function, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state. 

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs. This could potentially lead to conflicts or unintended behavior if multiple proposals with the same ID are created. 

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, atomicity violations, and ID uniqueness violations.
