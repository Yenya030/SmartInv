The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "lockedFunds" is being updated in the endExecute function without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the owner to execute functions that manipulate the state of the contract and potentially escalate their privileges.

3) Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws in the contract that could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
