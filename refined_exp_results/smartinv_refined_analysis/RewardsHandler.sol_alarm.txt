The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function is updating the state variable proposal.votedAmount without using proper synchronization mechanisms, such as mutex or locking mechanisms. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if the function is called multiple times concurrently.

2) Cross-bridge inconsistency: The endExecute function is checking for the balance of the votingToken contract held by the current contract and comparing it with the total supply of the votingToken. However, this comparison may not accurately reflect the overall state of the system, as tokens could be deposited or withdrawn from the contract by other parties, causing inconsistency in the calculations.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The code does not include any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which could potentially lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.
