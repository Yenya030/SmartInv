Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is being incremented in the "execute" function without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The "startingBalanceList" mapping is being updated with the proposal address as the key without ensuring that the key is unique, leading to ID uniqueness violation.
