Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` struct without initializing it first. This can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state-changing operations without being wrapped in a single atomic transaction. This could potentially result in inconsistencies if one of the operations fails.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `startExecute` function does not ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier. This can lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are created with the same identifier.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential vulnerability related to cross bridge inconsistency since the `TimelockController` contract implements the `IERC20` interface but doesn't show the full implementation. It's important to ensure that the implementation of the `IERC20` interface is consistent with the expected behavior to prevent vulnerabilities related to data crossing from one contract to another.
