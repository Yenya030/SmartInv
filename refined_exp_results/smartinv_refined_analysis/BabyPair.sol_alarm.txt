Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The startExecute function updates the proposal state with the starting balance, but there is no guarantee that the starting balance will be accurate at all times.
2) Atomicity violation: The execute function updates the votedAmount without using any locking mechanism, which could lead to race condition issues.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could lead to conflicts or errors in tracking proposals.
