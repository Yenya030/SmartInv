The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedProposal" function is called without specifying what it does, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates within the contract.

2) Privilege escalation: The "startExecute" function sets the proposal details without proper access control, which could lead to unauthorized users manipulating proposals.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with an external contract (IERC20) without proper validation, which could lead to inconsistencies between the two contracts.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure that proposal addresses or other identifiers are unique, which could lead to conflicts or overwrite existing data.

5) Business logic flaw: The logic for executing proposals and ending executions could be flawed and lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

6) Atomicity violation: The operations within functions like "execute" are not atomic, which could lead to issues with transaction integrity and consistency.
