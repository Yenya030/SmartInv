Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" in the "execute" function is updated without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with the "votingToken" contract, but it is not clear whether the token contract is secure and free from vulnerabilities that could be exploited through interactions with this contract.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is a lack of enforcement of unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts in the system.

4) Business logic flaw: The calculation and comparison in the "endExecute" function may not accurately reflect the intended business logic, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes.
