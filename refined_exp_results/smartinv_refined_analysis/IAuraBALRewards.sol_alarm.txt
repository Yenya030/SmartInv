Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized users from calling sensitive functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract's token, but this calculation may not accurately reflect the actual locked funds if other transfers or actions occur simultaneously. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
