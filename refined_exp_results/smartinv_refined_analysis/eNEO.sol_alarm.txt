The contract mentioned for analysis is:

contract ExchangeTokens {
     IERC20 public WETH;
     IERC20 public USDC;
     function  calculatePrice() public payable returns (uint) {
         
        return (USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) /
         WETH.balanceOf(address(pair)));
  }
}

Based on the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities are:
1) Price manipulation
2) Inconsistent state update
