Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct with the current block timestamp without checking for existing proposals, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The function execute() allows transferring tokens from the proposal address to the contract without adequately verifying the proposal's integrity, potentially leading to cross-bridge inconsistency. 
3) ID uniqueness violation: The proposal struct does not include a unique identifier for different proposals, which could lead to ID uniqueness violations and confusion when managing multiple proposals.
4) Privilege escalation: The owner variable is not properly used in the contract, potentially allowing for privilege escalation attacks if not correctly managed.
