The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The implementation of the endExecute function may lead to inconsistent state updates due to the lack of proper synchronization or checking before updating the lockedFunds variable. 

2) Atomicity violation: There is a potential atomicity violation in the execute function where multiple state updates are made without proper atomicity guarantees, which could lead to unexpected behavior if an error occurs during the execution.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is a possibility of ID uniqueness violation in the startExecute function, where the proposal struct is not uniquely identified or managed, leading to potential conflicts or errors in tracking different proposals.
