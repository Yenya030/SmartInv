The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update, as the execution of functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute might update the state of the contract in an unpredictable manner.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency, since there is a possibility of inconsistencies arising when crossing data or functionality between different parts of the contract.
3) ID uniqueness violation: there is no check for unique proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
