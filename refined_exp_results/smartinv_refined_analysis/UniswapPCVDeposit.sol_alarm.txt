Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) inconsistency in state update: 
- The contract's execution logic has multiple state variables that are being updated in different functions, such as `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, `lockedFunds`, without ensuring atomicity or consistency across the updates. This could lead to inconsistent state and potential errors in the contract's behavior.

2) ID uniqueness violation:
- There is a possibility that the `proposal` struct's `addr` field is not guaranteed to be unique or may be manipulated to create multiple proposals for the same address, leading to confusion or unexpected behaviors in the contract.

3) business logic flaw:
- The `endExecute` function checks for a condition where the `lockedFunds` should be greater than half of the total supply of the `votingToken`. This logic may have unintended consequences or may not accurately represent the intended business logic of the contract.

Overall, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, ID uniqueness violations, and business logic flaws.
