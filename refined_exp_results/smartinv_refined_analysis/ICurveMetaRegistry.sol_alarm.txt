The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function has a requirement that checks if the balance of the contract is greater than twice the total supply of the token. This logic may not correctly capture the intention of the contract and could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using a safe method like SafeMath, which could lead to inconsistent state updates in case of overflow or underflow.
3) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single atomic operation, which could lead to partial completion of the function and cause unexpected behavior.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is no explicit check or validation to ensure that the `votingToken` being transferred in the `execute` function is the correct token, which could lead to inconsistent behavior if an incorrect token is transferred.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and cross bridge inconsistency.
