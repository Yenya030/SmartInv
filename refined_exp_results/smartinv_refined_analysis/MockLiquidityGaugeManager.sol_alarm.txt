The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract's state may become inconsistent due to the possibility of the "votedAmount" not being properly updated and managed in the execute function. This could lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect execution of proposals.
2) Atomicity violation: There is a potential violation of atomicity in the execute function where multiple state changes are made without being wrapped in a single transaction. This could lead to race conditions and inconsistent state updates.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract lacks proper synchronization mechanisms for cross-bridge interactions, which could result in inconsistencies between different systems or chains.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a clear mechanism to ensure uniqueness of identifiers for proposals, which could lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.
