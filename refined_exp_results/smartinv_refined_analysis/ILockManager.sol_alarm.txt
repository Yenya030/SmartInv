Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of duplication of proposal identifiers.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state update of startingBalanceList may not be synchronized with the proposal initiation.
3) Atomicity violation: The execution of transferFrom, adding votedAmount, and calling votedProposal are not atomic operations which may lead to unexpected behavior in case of failure.
4) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to critical functions.
