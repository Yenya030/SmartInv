The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not consistently update the state of the proposal struct throughout the functions, leading to potential issues with the integrity of the data.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential for inconsistency in the cross bridge transfer logic between the execute function and the endExecute function, which could lead to funds being locked or lost.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to have any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs associated with proposals, which could lead to conflicts or errors in the system.
