The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple functions that update the state of the proposal struct, such as startExecute, execute, and endExecute. There may be potential inconsistencies in the state updates if these functions are not carefully coordinated.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with the votingToken contract in the execute function by transferring tokens. This interaction could potentially lead to inconsistencies between the two contracts if not properly managed.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any checks to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could lead to issues if proposals are overwritten or duplicated.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, cross bridge inconsistency, and ID uniqueness violation.
