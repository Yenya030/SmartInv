Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronisation, which could lead to inconsistent state in the contract.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or errors in the system.
