The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of tokens held in the contract. However, there is no indication of what `lockedFunds` is used for or how it affects the contract's behavior. This inconsistency may lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state updates happening in the `execute()` function without utilizing any form of atomicity mechanism. This can potentially lead to race conditions or inconsistent state updates.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `execute()` function transfers tokens from the `proposal.addr` to the contract's address, which could potentially introduce inconsistencies if the owner or other parties rely on the balance of `proposal.addr`.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and cross bridge inconsistency.
