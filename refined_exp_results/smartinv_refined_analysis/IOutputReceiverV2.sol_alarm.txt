The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

- Inconsistent state update: There is no clear indication of how the `lockedFunds` variable is being used or updated in the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal in the `TimelockController` contract has a unique identifier, which can potentially lead to ID uniqueness violations.
