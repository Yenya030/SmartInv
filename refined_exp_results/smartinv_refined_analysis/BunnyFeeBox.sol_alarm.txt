The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount`, but it does not ensure that the state update is atomic, which could lead to inconsistent data if multiple transactions are processed simultaneously.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs. This could potentially lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if duplicate IDs are generated.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts such as `votingToken`, but there are no checks or validations to ensure the consistency and reliability of data transfer between contracts. This can lead to discrepancies or inconsistencies in data handling across different contracts.
