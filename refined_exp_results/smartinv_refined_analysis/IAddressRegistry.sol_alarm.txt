The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute()` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `proposal` struct without protecting against reentrancy, which could lead to an inconsistent state if another contract interacts with this contract during the execution process.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function performs multiple state changes without atomicity, which can lead to unexpected behavior if one of the state changes fails midway through the execution.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract does not handle potential inconsistencies between the state of the `proposal` struct and the actual execution of the proposal, which can lead to unexpected outcomes or vulnerabilities.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not implement any checks to ensure the uniqueness of proposals, which could result in conflicts if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.

5) Business logic flaw: The conditions for executing a proposal and ending execution may not adequately protect against all possible scenarios, leaving potential loopholes or vulnerabilities in the contract.
