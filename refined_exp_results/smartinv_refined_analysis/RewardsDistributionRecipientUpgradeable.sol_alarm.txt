Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state of "proposal" and "startingBalanceList" in the "startExecute" function without properly checking for existing proposals or handling potential reentrancy attacks.
2) Atomicity violation: The "execute" function performs multiple state changes without being wrapped in a single transaction, which could lead to inconsistent state if any step fails halfway through the execution.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts (ERC20 tokens) without proper validation, which could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior if the external contracts behave maliciously or unexpectedly.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no clear mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in the proposal handling process.
