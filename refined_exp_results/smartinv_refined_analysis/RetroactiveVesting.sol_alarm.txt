The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function may result in a business logic flaw as the condition for a successful execution (require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()) may not adequately ensure the correctness of the execution.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state updates in the startExecute and execute functions, where the state variables proposal and startingBalanceList are being modified without proper synchronization.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: As the contract involves the transfer of tokens (votingToken) between different functions, there is a potential for cross bridge inconsistency if the state variables are not updated correctly after each transfer operation.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not include any explicit checks to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior.
