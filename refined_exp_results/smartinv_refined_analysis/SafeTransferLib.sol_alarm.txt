Contract to Analyze:

contract CrossBridge {
    address public tokenBridge;
    mapping(uint256 => bool) processedTransactions;

    function transferToken(uint256 transactionId) external {
        require(processedTransactions[transactionId] == false, "Transaction already processed");
        require(msg.sender == tokenBridge, "Only tokenBridge can call this function");
        
        // Process transfer logic
        
        processedTransactions[transactionId] = true;
    }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Privilege Escalation: The `transferToken` function only checks if the caller is the `tokenBridge`, but it does not have any other access control mechanisms in place. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation if unauthorized users gain access to the `tokenBridge` account.
2) Inconsistent State Update: The `processedTransactions` mapping is updated to mark a transaction as processed without any further verification or validation logic, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or vulnerability to reentrancy attacks.
