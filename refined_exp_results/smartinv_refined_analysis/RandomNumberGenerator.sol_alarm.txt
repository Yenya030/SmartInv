Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the startExecute function updates the state of the proposal without checking for existing proposals, leading to potential inconsistencies.
2) Atomicity violation: The execution of the execute function involves multiple state changes without utilizing locking mechanisms, which can lead to atomicity violations.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The implementation does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, potentially leading to conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
