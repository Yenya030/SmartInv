The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates as various state variables like `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` are being modified in different functions without adequate checks.
2) Atomicity violation: There is a possibility of atomicity violation as the `execute()` function involves multiple steps where the state is modified without the use of proper synchronization mechanisms.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have any uniqueness checks for the `addr` field, which may lead to ID uniqueness violations.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `owner` address is declared as internal, but its functionality and usage across the contract are not defined, potentially leading to cross bridge inconsistency.
