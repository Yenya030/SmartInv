Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal struct without checking if any proposal is already ongoing, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function performs multiple state-changing operations without using proper synchronization techniques to ensure atomicity, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if the function reverts midway.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of validation or synchronization mechanisms between different functions in the contract, which could potentially lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors due to different parts of the contract operating on different assumptions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure that proposal IDs are unique, which could lead to conflicts or confusion in the future if duplicate IDs are created.
