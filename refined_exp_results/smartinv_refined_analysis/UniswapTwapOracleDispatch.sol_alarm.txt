Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or atomicity checks.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping is being updated based on the `proposal.addr` without ensuring uniqueness of IDs.
3) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function seems to have a potential flaw in the logic.
