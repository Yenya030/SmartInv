Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There seems to be lack of consistent state updates in the contract, especially in the startExecute and execute functions where the proposal structure is being updated without proper synchronization.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is a possibility of ID uniqueness violation as the proposal identifier is not generated in a way to ensure uniqueness throughout the contract's lifecycle. 
3) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the execute function where multiple state changes are happening sequentially without proper checks or synchronization to ensure atomicity.
