Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without proper checks and can lead to inconsistent data.
2) Privilege escalation: The execution of the execute() function can be manipulated to escalate privileges and perform unauthorized actions.
3) Atomicity violation: The execute() function does multiple state changes without proper atomicity checks, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of proper validation or synchronization between the different functions in the contract, which can lead to inconsistencies in the data flow.
5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks proper checks to ensure uniqueness of certain identifiers, which can lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
