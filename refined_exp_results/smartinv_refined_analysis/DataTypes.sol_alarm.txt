The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without properly checking if the conditions for execution have been met. This could lead to an inconsistent state of the contract.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs assigned to proposals. This could lead to conflicts or overwrite existing proposals.
