Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable in the "endExecute" function is being updated based on the balance of the contract at that specific moment, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance changes before the function completes execution.
2) Privilege escalation: The "startExecute" function allows any caller to initiate a new proposal without proper authorization or verification, potentially leading to privilege escalation issues.
3) Business logic flaw: The requirement check in the "endExecute" function that compares the balance of the contract to double the total supply of the voting token may not accurately represent the intended business logic, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. 

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, privilege escalation, and business logic flaws.
