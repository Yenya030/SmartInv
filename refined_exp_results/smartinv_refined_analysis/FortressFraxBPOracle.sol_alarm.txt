Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function such as `transferFrom` and updating `proposal.votedAmount` are not wrapped in a single atomic operation, which could result in partial state changes if one operation fails.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `startExecute` function seems to use a single global `proposal` struct without any mechanism to ensure unique IDs, which could lead to data overwrite or confusion if multiple proposals are started simultaneously.

Please note that the contract seems to require further analysis for potential vulnerabilities not covered in this brief review.
