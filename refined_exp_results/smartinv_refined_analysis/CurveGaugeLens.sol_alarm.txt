Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is incremented in the 'execute' function, but it is not persisted anywhere in the contract state.
2) Atomicity violation: The 'execute' function involves multiple state changes (transferFrom, incrementing 'proposal.votedAmount'), but there is no mechanism to ensure that these changes occur atomically, leading to potential inconsistencies.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The 'proposal.addr' is used as a parameter for 'votingToken.transferFrom' in the 'execute' function, but the actual balance of 'proposal.addr' is only retrieved and stored in 'startingBalanceList' in the 'startExecute' function, potentially leading to inconsistencies.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The 'proposal' struct does not have any unique identifier associated with each proposal, which could lead to confusion or manipulation if multiple proposals are created.
