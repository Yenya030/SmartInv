Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal struct is being updated in the startExecute and execute functions without proper checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.
2) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the update of votedAmount in the execute function. If multiple users try to execute the function simultaneously, it could result in incorrect calculations.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that the proposal ID is unique, which could potentially lead to data conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
