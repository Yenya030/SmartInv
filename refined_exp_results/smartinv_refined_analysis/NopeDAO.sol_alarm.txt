The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute()` modifies the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` directly without any synchronization mechanism, which could result in inconsistent data updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `endExecute()` contains multiple state-changing operations without any atomicity guarantee, which could lead to partial execution of the function and unintended side effects.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract seems to involve multiple interactions with other contracts (such as `votingToken` and `pair`), introducing the possibility of cross-bridge inconsistencies if the data retrieved from these contracts is not verified or controlled properly.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The use of `msg.sender` in the `Proposal` struct could lead to potential ID uniqueness violations if multiple proposals are initiated by the same address.
