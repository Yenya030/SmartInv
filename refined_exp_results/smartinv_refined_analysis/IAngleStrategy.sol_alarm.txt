The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract TokenExchange {
     IERC20 public tokenA;
     IERC20 public tokenB;
     
     function swapTokens(uint amount) external {
         tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
         tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
     }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not check if the `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions execute successfully before updating the state variables, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The contract does not use any form of mutex or locking mechanism to ensure that the swap operation is performed atomically, leaving room for potential race conditions.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a risk of inconsistency between the two tokens being swapped, as the contract does not verify if the correct tokens are being exchanged in the `swapTokens` function.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, atomicity violations, and cross bridge inconsistency.
