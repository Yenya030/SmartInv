Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state of the proposal struct without using proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The startExecute function relies on the proposal struct being in a specific state (proposal.sTime == 0) before initializing it, which could introduce inconsistencies if multiple parties try to start an execution simultaneously.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that the Proposal struct's address field is unique, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
4) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to restrict certain functions only to authorized parties, potentially allowing unauthorized calls to critical functions like execute.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to state inconsistencies, potential conflicts due to lacking ID uniqueness validation, and unauthorized privilege escalation.
