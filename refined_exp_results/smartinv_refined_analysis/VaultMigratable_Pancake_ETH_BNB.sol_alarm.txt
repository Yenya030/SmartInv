Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which may lead to ID uniqueness violation.
3) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function, such as transferring tokens and updating the `proposal.votedAmount`, are not executed atomically, leaving room for atomicity violations.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract involves interactions with other contracts or external systems (e.g., `votingToken.transferFrom`), which can potentially introduce inconsistencies and vulnerabilities related to cross-bridge interactions.
