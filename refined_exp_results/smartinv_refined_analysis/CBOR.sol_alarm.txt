The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the proposal is actually in a state where it should be updated. This could lead to inconsistent data within the contract if not handled properly.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not contain a unique identifier for each proposal. This could potentially lead to issues with tracking and managing multiple proposals if identifiers are not implemented.
