Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute in the TimelockController contract updates the proposal.votedAmount without properly handling potential reentrancy attacks. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique identifiers for proposals, which could lead to issues with data integrity and potentially allow for unauthorized access or manipulation of proposals.
