Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables proposal and startingBalanceList are being updated in functions startExecute and execute without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The execution of multiple operations within functions startExecute and execute could potentially result in atomicity violations if the operations are not completed as a single, indivisible unit.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of consistency in handling proposals and balances, which could open up opportunities for cross bridge inconsistency issues.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The way proposals are stored and managed does not ensure unique identification, potentially leading to ID uniqueness violations.
5) Business logic flaw: The logic for executing proposals and ending execution may have flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the system for their benefit.
