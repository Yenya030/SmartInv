Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which may lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to modify the variable simultaneously.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could result in conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
