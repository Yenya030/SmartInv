Potential vulnerabilities in the contract to analyze:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is a lack of proper synchronization or locking mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function based on the balance of `votingToken` in the contract, but there is no direct correlation between this balance update and the completion of the execution process, potentially leading to cross bridge inconsistency.
