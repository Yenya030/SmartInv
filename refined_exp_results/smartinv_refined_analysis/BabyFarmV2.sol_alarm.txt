Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` of the `Proposal` struct in the `execute` function is being directly incremented without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes without using proper atomicity mechanisms, which could lead to issues if one of the changes fails midway through execution.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `votingToken.transferFrom` function in the `execute` function may interact with external contracts or systems, introducing the possibility of cross-bridge inconsistencies if the external call fails or behaves unexpectedly.
