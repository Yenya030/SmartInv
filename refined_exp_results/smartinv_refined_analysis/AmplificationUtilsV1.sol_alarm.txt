Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variable 'lockedFunds' in the endExecute function without resetting the proposal state to 0, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or confusion in tracking and managing proposals.
3) Business logic flaw: The execution logic in the execute function may not be appropriate, as there is a discrepancy between the time constraints and the voting status check, which could potentially lead to unintended consequences.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract references an external contract (IERC20) without ensuring consistency between them, which may result in data inconsistency or incorrect functionality.
