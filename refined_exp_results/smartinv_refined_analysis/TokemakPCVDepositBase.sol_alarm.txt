Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating state variables like proposal.sTime and proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state updates happening in the execute function without proper atomicity checks. This can lead to race conditions and inconsistent state updates.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract is not enforcing uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to confusion and potential conflicts in the proposal handling process.
