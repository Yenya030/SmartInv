Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without using any locking mechanism to ensure atomicity.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The votingToken.transferFrom function is susceptible to ID uniqueness violation if multiple calls are made with the same ID, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers.
