The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for the update of the proposal's votedAmount without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to an inconsistent state.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of the proposal's properties in multiple functions without proper validation or synchronization could lead to cross bridge inconsistency issues.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in handling multiple proposals.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, cross bridge inconsistency, and ID uniqueness violation.
