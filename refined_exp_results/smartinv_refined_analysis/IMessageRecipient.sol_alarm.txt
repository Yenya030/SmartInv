The contract provided for analysis:

contract Bridge {
    address public tokenAddress;
    
    function setTokenAddress(address _tokenAddress) external {
        tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
    }
    
    function getTokenBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return IERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The `setTokenAddress` function allows anyone to set the `tokenAddress` variable. Without proper validation, this can lead to the same tokenAddress being set multiple times, violating the uniqueness of the ID.
2) Business logic flaw: The contract does not restrict unauthorized access to the `setTokenAddress` function, allowing anyone to manipulate the tokenAddress. This can lead to unintended behaviors and exploit the business logic.
3) Inconsistent state update: If the `setTokenAddress` function is called multiple times without proper validation or safeguards, the contract's state can become inconsistent, affecting the overall functionality.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract lacks proper checks and validations when setting the `tokenAddress`, which can result in inconsistent state across different instances of the Bridge contract or with external systems.
