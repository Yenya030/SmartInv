The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 sTime;
        uint256 votedAmount;
        address addr;
    }
    
    address internal owner;
    IERC20 votingToken;
    Proposal public proposal;

    function startExecute() external {
        uint256 startingBalance;
        require(proposal.sTime == 0, "on-going proposal");
        proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
        startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
        startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance;
    }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
        require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through");
        votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
        proposal.votedAmount += amount;
        votedProposal(proposal);
    }

    function endExecute() external {
        require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
        require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) * 2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
        lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistencies in the state updates where the `proposal` struct is modified in different functions without proper synchronization.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There could be a violation of ID uniqueness if the `proposal` struct is not properly managed and there is a possibility of duplicate proposals being created or executed.
3) Privilege escalation: There is a potential for privilege escalation if there are vulnerabilities in the access control mechanisms for the `owner` and `votingToken` variables.
4) Business logic flaw: The business logic in the contract may have flaws that could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if not carefully reviewed and tested.
5) Atomicity violation: There might be a violation of atomicity if there are operations that need to be executed atomically but are not properly handled in the contract code.
6) Cross-bridge inconsistency: There may be inconsistencies in the interactions with external contracts or services, leading to potential vulnerabilities related to cross-contract calls or external dependencies.
