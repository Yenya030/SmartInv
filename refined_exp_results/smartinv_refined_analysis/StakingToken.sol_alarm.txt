The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the "execute" function updates the state variables "proposal.votedAmount" without proper synchronization or atomicity checks. This could result in inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal concurrently.

2) Cross Bridge Inconsistency: The contract uses the IERC20 interface, which indicates interaction with external tokens. If the external token contracts are not implemented correctly or behave unexpectedly, it could lead to cross-bridge inconsistency issues in this contract.
