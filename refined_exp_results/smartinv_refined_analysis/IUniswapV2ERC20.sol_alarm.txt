The contract is vulnerable to:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without ensuring that the token transfer is successful.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The function execute transfers tokens from proposal.addr to the contract's address without checking if the caller has the necessary permissions.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The code snippet does not provide a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or errors in tracking proposals.
