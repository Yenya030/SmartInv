The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract CrossBridge {
    IERC20 public token1;
    IERC20 public token2;
    
    function swap(uint amount) external {
        require(token1.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract `CrossBridge`:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly handle the state update during the swap process, which may lead to inconsistencies in the balances of `token1` and `token2`.

2) Atomicity violation: The swap function does not wrap token transfers in a single atomic operation, opening up the possibility of an incomplete swap if one transfer succeeds and the other fails.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract does not verify the consistency between the two tokens during the swap, leaving room for manipulation or unexpected behavior if one token's transfer fails while the other succeeds.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not verify the uniqueness of IDs or addresses involved in the swap, potentially leading to incorrect token transfers or other issues.
