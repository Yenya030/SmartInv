Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables that are updated without proper synchronization or validation checks, which could lead to inconsistent or unintended state changes.

2) Privilege escalation: The contract has functions that can be called by any address, potentially allowing unauthorized users to escalate their privileges and perform actions they should not be able to.

3) Business logic flaw: The contract logic for executing proposals and ending execution has vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the outcome of proposals.

4) Atomicity violation: The contract lacks proper atomicity checks when updating state variables, which could lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness checks for certain identifiers or addresses, which could lead to conflicts or errors in the system.
