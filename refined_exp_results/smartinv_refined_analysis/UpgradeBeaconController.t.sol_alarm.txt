Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state. 
2) ID uniqueness violation: The startExecute function does not check for the uniqueness of the proposal ID before creating a new proposal, which could lead to errors if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.
