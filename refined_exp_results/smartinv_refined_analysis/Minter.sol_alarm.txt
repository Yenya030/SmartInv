The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without properly checking if the proposal has already been executed. This can lead to inconsistent data state within the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` transfers tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract address and then increments the `votedAmount` of the proposal without using the appropriate techniques to ensure atomicity. This can lead to issues if the transfer is successful but the increment fails.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not seem to have a unique identifier to distinguish between different proposals. This can lead to confusion or potential security risks if multiple proposals are created and executed simultaneously.
