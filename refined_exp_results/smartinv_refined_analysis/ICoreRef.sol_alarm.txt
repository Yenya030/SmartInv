The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no locking mechanism or check to prevent multiple calls that may result in inconsistent state updates.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for the `addr` field in the `Proposal` struct, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are created with the same address.

3) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized users from starting, executing, or ending proposals. This could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
