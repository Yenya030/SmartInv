The contract to be analyzed is as follows:

contract CrossBridgeContract {
    address public token1;
    address public token2;
    
    function swapTokens(uint256 amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == token1 || msg.sender == token2, "Unauthorized access");
        
        // Swap tokens logic
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the CrossBridgeContract are:
1) Privilege escalation: The swapTokens function does not restrict access to only the intended token1 and token2 addresses, allowing unauthorized users to call the function.
2) Business logic flaw: The swapTokens function lacks adequate validation or checks on the token amounts being swapped, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploits.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract does not ensure that both token1 and token2 are properly swapped in an atomic and consistent manner, opening up the possibility of inconsistencies in token balances or states.
