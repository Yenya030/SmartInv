Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals or any other entities that may require unique identification. This could lead to potential conflicts or errors in the system.
2) Inconsistent state update: The way the `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the proposal struct may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal at the same time.
3) Privilege escalation: The use of the `owner` variable in the contract may lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities if there are no proper access control mechanisms in place to restrict access to sensitive functions or data.
