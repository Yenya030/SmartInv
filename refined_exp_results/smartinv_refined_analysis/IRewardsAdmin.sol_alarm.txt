Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the same account cannot vote multiple times or manipulate the `votedAmount` unfairly.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier associated with each proposal, which could lead to conflicts or confusion when multiple proposals are initiated.
3) Privilege escalation: The `owner` variable is not utilized in the contract, potentially leading to unauthorized access to critical functions or data.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, ID uniqueness violations, and potential privilege escalation.
