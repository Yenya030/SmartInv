Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
2) Price manipulation: The `calculatePrice()` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract calculates the price based on the balance of USDC and WETH in the `pair` address. An attacker could potentially manipulate the price by controlling the balances of USDC and WETH in the `pair` address.

6) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is no explicit check or validation to ensure the consistency between the data being used for price calculation in `calculatePrice()` and the actual token balances in the `pair` address. This could lead to inconsistencies and potential manipulation of prices.
