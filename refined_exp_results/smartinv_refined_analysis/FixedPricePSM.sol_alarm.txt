Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposals, which could potentially lead to ID collision or confusion.
