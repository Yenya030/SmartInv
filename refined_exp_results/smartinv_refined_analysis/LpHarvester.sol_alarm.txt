The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract's logic allows for changing the state of the proposal without proper synchronization and could lead to inconsistent data.

2) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the `execute` function where multiple state changes happen without proper atomicity protection, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with multiple external contracts (such as `votingToken`), which can introduce inconsistencies if the state of these external contracts changes during the execution of the contract.
