Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw - The function `endExecute` checks if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total supply of the voting token to determine if the execution was successful. This logic may not accurately reflect the success or failure of the execution.
2) Inconsistent state update - The calculation of locked funds in the `endExecute` function is based on the balance of the contract at a specific point in time, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance changes before the function completes.
3) ID uniqueness violation - The `proposal` struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, which may lead to issues in tracking and managing multiple proposals.
