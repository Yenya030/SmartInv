Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploits.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` is updated without proper validation, allowing potential manipulation of data across different parts of the contract.
