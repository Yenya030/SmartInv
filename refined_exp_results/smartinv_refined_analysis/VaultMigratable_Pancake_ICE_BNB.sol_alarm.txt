The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

- Privilege escalation: The contract allows the `startExecute` function to be called by any external account, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being taken.
- Atomicity violation: The `execute` function executes multiple operations that should be performed atomically, but they are not wrapped in a single transaction, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.
- Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that the voting operation is fully completed, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
- Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external token contracts (`votingToken`) without ensuring that the cross-bridge communication is secure and consistent, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

Overall, the contract has significant vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation, atomicity violation, inconsistent state updates, and cross bridge inconsistency.
