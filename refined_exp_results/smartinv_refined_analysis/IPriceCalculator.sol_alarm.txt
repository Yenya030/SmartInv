Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no check to ensure that it is being updated correctly or consistently with the rest of the contract state.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There are no mechanisms in place to ensure that `proposal.addr` values are unique, which could lead to potential conflicts or inconsistencies in the contract logic.
