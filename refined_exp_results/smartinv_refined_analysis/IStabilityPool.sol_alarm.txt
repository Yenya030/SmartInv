Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function does not accurately check if the execution has ended and if the voting has gone through.

2) Atomicity violation: There is no atomicity check in the execute function when transferring tokens and updating the voted amount.

3) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct but does not update any state variable related to the proposal itself, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for uniqueness of proposal ID when starting a new proposal, which could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple proposals are started simultaneously.

5) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is no clear indication of how the TimelockController contract interacts with other contracts, potentially leading to inconsistent behavior when interacting with external contracts.
