It has the role\n/// \"operator\" that is the one used by a backend app to make some calls\n/// @dev It saves in an ordered array the player wallet and the current\n/// entries count. So buying entries has a complexity of O(1)\n/// For calculating the winner, from the huge random number generated by Chainlink\n/// a normalized random is generated by using the module method, adding 1 to have\n/// a random from 1 to entriesCount.\n/// So next step is to perform a binary search on the ordered array to get the\n/// player O(log n)\n/// Example:\n/// 0 -> { 1, player1} as player1 buys 1 entry\n/// 1 -> {51, player2} as player2 buys 50 entries\n/// 2 -> {52, player3} as player3 buys 1 entry\n/// 3 -> {53, player4} as player4 buys 1 entry\n/// 4 -> {153, player5} as player5 buys 100 entries\n/// So the setWinner method performs a binary search on that sorted array to get the upper bound.\n/// If the random number generated is 150, the winner is player5.

Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and\n * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you\n * @dev want to generate randomness from.\n *\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.\n *\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value\n * @dev generated from your seed.\n *\n * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by\n * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent\n * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is\n * @dev associated with which randomness.

If your contract must store the response (or\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n *\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n *\n * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the\n * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact\n * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API\n * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.\n *\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n * @dev to the VRF.
