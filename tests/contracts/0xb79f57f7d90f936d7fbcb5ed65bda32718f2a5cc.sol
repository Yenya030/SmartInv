Withdraws will remain open, and funds will be added while users are staked.\n\nThere is a Bad Actor mapping to tag users who potentially are looking to game the contract, we are watching, you will be seen.\nPlay Nice, you get one warning.\n\n0xA8A837E2bf0c37fEf5C495951a0DFc33aaEAD57A\n714000000000000\n\n*/\n\n\n\n\n\ncontract LinqStakingV1 is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {\n\n\n    struct
