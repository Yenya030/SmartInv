Create subscription, fund it\n * @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\n * @dev subscription management functions).\n * @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\n * @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),\n * @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).\n *\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\n *\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\n * @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\n *\n * @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\n * @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\n * @dev with which randomness request.\n * @dev See \"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\" for principles to keep in mind,\n * @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\n *\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\n * @dev differ.\n *\n * *****************************************************************************\n * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n *\n * @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\n * @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\n * @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\n * @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\n *\n * @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\n * @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\n * @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\n * @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\n * @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n * @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n * @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n *\n * @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n * @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n * @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n * @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n * @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n *\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n * @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n * @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n * @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n * @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n * @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n * @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software).\n */\nabstract contract VRFConsumerBaseV2 {\n  error OnlyCoordinatorCanFulfill(address have, address want);\n  address private immutable vrfCoordinator;\n\n  /**\n   * @param _vrfCoordinator address of VRFCoordinator contract\n   */\n  constructor(address _vrfCoordinator) {\n    vrfCoordinator = _vrfCoordinator;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @notice fulfillRandomness handles the VRF response.
