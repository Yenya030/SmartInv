3 /* A small utility contract that sends ether to other addresses by means of 
4  * SUICIDE/SELFDESTRUCT. Unlike for a normal send/call, if the receiving address
5  * belongs to a contract, the contract's code is never called; one can
6  * forcibly increase a contract's balance!
7  *
8  * To send $x to y using this technique, simply call `suicideSend(y)` with a 
9  * value of $x.
10  *
11  *
12  * If you're interested in the implications of this trick, I recommend
13  * looking at Jo√£o Carvalho's and Richard Moore's entries to the first
14  * Underhanded Solidity Contest [1]. Anybody writing smart ontracts should be 
15  * aware of forced balance increases lest their contracts be vulnerable.
