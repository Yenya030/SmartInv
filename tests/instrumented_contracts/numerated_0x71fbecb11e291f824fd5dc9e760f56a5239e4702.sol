108      *
109      * The following scenario could be the expected outcome by Alice, but if not, Alice would need to set
110      * her approval to Bob to 0 before Alice purchases more tokens.
111      *
112      *  1. Alice has 100 tokens.
113      *  2. Alice approves 50 tokens for Bob.
114      *  3. Alice approves 100 tokens for Charles
115      *  4. Bob calls transferFrom and receives his 50 tokens.
116      *  5. Charles calls transferFrom and receives the remaining 50 tokens
117      *  6. Charles still has an approval for 50 more tokens from Alice, even though she now owns 0 tokens.
118      *  7. Alice purchases 50 more tokens
119      *  8. Charles sees this, and immediately calls transferFrom and receives those 50 tokens.
120      *
121      * Scenario 2:
122      *
123      * This is a race condition. To mitigate this problem, Alice should set the allowance to 0 in step 2,
124      * then wait until it's mined, then if Bob didn't take the 100 she can set to 50. (Otherwise Bob may
125      * potentially get 150 tokens)
126      *
127      *
128      *  1. Alice approves Bob for 100,
129      *  2. Alice changes it to 50
130      *  3. Bob sees the change in the mempool before it's mined, and sends a new transaction
131      *     that will hopefully win the race and withdraw the 100 first, meanwhile the 50 will
132      *     be mined after and allow Bob to withdraw another 50.
