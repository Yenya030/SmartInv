7     All of the following might at times be used to refer to this coin: "MILS", 
8     "MILs", "MIL$", "$MILS", "$MILs", "$MIL$", "MilitaryToken". In social 
9     settings we prefer the text "MILs" but in formal listings "MILS" and "$MILS" 
10     are the best symbols. In the Solidity code, the official symbol can be found 
11     below which is "MILS".
