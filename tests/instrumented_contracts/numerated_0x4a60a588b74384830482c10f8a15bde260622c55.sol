243  * to implement supply mechanisms].

247  * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
248  * applications.

251  * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
252  * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
253  * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
254  *
255  * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
256  * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
257  * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
