13 CONTRACT DESCRIPTION
14 -----------------------------------------------------------------
15 
16 A contract with an owner, that can push arbitrary data to be emitted
17 as an event.
18 
19 The intention of this contract is to post a merkle tree root hash of
20 a group of events, to ensure that data from an external source can
21 be validated as having not been altered.

40 A contract with an owner, to be inherited by other contracts.
41 Requires its owner to be explicitly set in the constructor.
42 Provides an onlyOwner access modifier.
43 
44 To change owner, the current owner must nominate the next owner,
45 who then has to accept the nomination. The nomination can be
46 cancelled before it is accepted by the new owner by having the
47 previous owner change the nomination (setting it to 0).
48 
49 If the ownership is to be relinquished, then it can be handed
50 to a smart contract whose only function is to accept that
51 ownership, which guarantees no owner-only functionality can
52 ever be invoked.
