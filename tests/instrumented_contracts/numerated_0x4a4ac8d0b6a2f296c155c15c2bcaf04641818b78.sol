106 On the Token Distribution Event, Company shall deliver to Buyer a number of
107 Project Tokens calculated by the following formula:
108 x=Pt∗(1+b)
109 where “x” is the number of tokens that the Buyer will receive after the Token

111 end of the Token Distribution Event) and “b” is Bonus Rate (e.g. 0.1 for 10%).
112 Example: 100 ETH / 1 ETH * (1 + 0.1) = 110 tokens.
113 Usage License
114 Ownership of Project Tokens carries no rights, whether express or implied, other
115 than a limited right (license) to use the Project Token Protocol, if and to the
116 extent the Project Token Protocol has been successfully completed and launched.
117 In particular, Buyer understands and accepts that Project Tokens do not
118 represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or
119 equivalent rights nor any right to receive future revenues, shares or any other
120 form of participation or governance right in or relating to the Project Token
121 Protocol and/or the Project Tokens.
122 By transferring ETH to Company and/or receiving Project Tokens, no form of
123 partnership, joint venture or any similar relationship between the Buyer and
124 Company is created.
125 Risks
126 The Buyer understands and accepts the risks in connection with making a
127 Contribution to Company and creating Project Tokens. In particular, but not
128 concluding, the Buyer understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter as
129 well as in the Contribution Terms, which will be handed over to Buyer:
130 Risk of software weaknesses: The Buyer understands and accepts that the Smart
131 Contract System concept, the underlying software application and software
132 platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage
133 and unproven, why there is no warranty that the process for creating Project
134 Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk
135 that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing,
136 inter alia, the complete loss of ETH and/or Project Tokens.
137 Regulatory risk: The Buyer understands and accepts that the blockchain
138 technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain
139 jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations
140 addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to
141 the current setup of the Smart Contract System and which may, inter alia, result
142 in substantial modifications of the Smart Contract System and/or the Project
143 Token Protocol, including its termination and the loss of Project Tokens for the
144 Buyer.
145 Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The Buyer understands and accepts that
146 the creation of the Project Tokens and the development of the Project Token
147 Protocol may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest
148 from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g.
149 caused by competing projects). The Buyer therefore understands that there is no
150 assurance that, even if the Project Token Protocol is partially or fully
151 developed and launched, the Buyer will receive any benefits through the Project
152 Tokens held by him.
153 Risk of withdrawing partners: The Buyer understands and accepts that the TGE and
154 the feasibility of the Project as a whole depends strongly on the collaboration
155 of banks and other crucial partners of Company. The Buyer therefore understands
156 that there is no assurance that TGE will take place as foreseen or the Project
157 as a whole will be successfully executed.
158 Risk associated with other applications: The Buyer understands and accepts that
159 the Project Token Protocol may give rise to other, alternative projects,
160 promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which Project Tokens will have no
161 intrinsic value.
162 Risk of loss of private key: Project Tokens can only be accessed by using an
163 Ethereum Wallet with a combination of Buyer’s account information (address),
164 private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. The
165 Buyer understands and accepts that if his private key file or password
166 respectively got lost or stolen, the obtained Project Tokens associated with the
167 Buyer's account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and will be
168 permanently lost.
169 Risk of theft: The Buyer understands and accepts that the Smart Contract System
170 concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the
171 Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals
172 that could result in theft or loss of Project Tokens or ETH.
173 Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: The Buyer understands and accepts that, as with
174 other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Smart Contract System is
175 susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend
176 attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race
177 condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Smart Contract
178 System, expected proper execution and sequencing of Project Token transactions,
179 and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.
180 Token Liquidity. Buyer understands that with regard to Project Tokens no market
181 liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value (if any) of Project Tokens over
182 time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate resulting in full and total
183 loss that will be borne exclusively by Buyer with respect to the Project Tokens
184 Buyer purchases under this Agreement.
185 Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The Buyer understands and accepts, that the
186 Wallet or Wallet service provider used for the contribution, has to be
187 technically compatible with the Project Token. The failure to assure this may
188 have the result that Buyer will not gain access to his Project Token.
189 Limited Warranties. Except as otherwise set forth herein, in the White Paper,
190 Token Characteristics Document, and/or the Token Distribution Plan, Buyer
191 understands and expressly accepts that there is no warranty whatsoever of the
192 Project Token and/or the success of the Project, expressed or implied, to the
193 extent permitted by law, and that Project Tokens will be created and delivered
194 to Buyer at the sole risk of Buyer on an “as is” and “under development” basis
195 and without, to the extent permitted by law, any warranties of any kind,
196 including, but not limited to, express or implied warranties of merchantability
197 or fitness for a particular purpose.
198 Limitations on Recovery. Buyer understands that Buyer has no right against any
199 Company or any other Person to request any refund or redemption of the Purchase
200 Price except as otherwise provided herein and/or as a result of, or in
201 connection with, Company’s breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful
202 misconduct.

204 Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer, as of the date hereof, as
205 follows:

212 material default under, with or without the passage of time or the giving of
213 notice (A) any provision of Company’s Organizational Documents; (B) any

221 not be well defined under law. The Company has taken reasonable steps to ensure
222 the legitimacy of its operations.

224 Property. To the extent that could be reasonably known to the Company, the

273 Token Liquidity. Buyer understands that with regard to Project Tokens no market
274 liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value (if any) of Project Tokens over
275 time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate resulting in full and total
276 loss that will be borne exclusively by Buyer with respect to the Project Tokens
277 Buyer purchases under this Agreement.
278 Sole Responsibility for Taxes. Buyer understands that Buyer bears sole
279 responsibility for any taxes as a result of the matters and transactions the

282 to hold Company or any of its Affiliates, employees or agents (including
283 developers, auditors, contractors or founders) liable for any taxes associated
284 with or arising from Buyer’s purchase of Project Tokens hereunder, or the use or
285 ownership of Project Tokens.
