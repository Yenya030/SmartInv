238  * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.

240  * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

243  *
244  * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
245  * this function so it returns a different value.
246  *
247  * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
248  * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
249  * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
250  * applications.
251  *
252  * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
253  * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
254  * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
255  * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
256  *
257  * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
258  * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
259  * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
