Please carefully study the following examples and identify potential vulnerabilities in the contract at the end from the following possible vulnerabilities: 1)price manipulation; 2) privilege escalation; 3) business logic flaw; 4) inconsistent state update; 5) atomicity violation; 6) cross bridge inconsistency; 7) ID uniqueness violation; 8) reentrancy; 9) integer overflow/underflow; 10) arithmetic flaw; 11) sucidal contracts; 12)ether leakage; 13) insufficient gas; 14) incorrect visibility/ownership. To provide examples, the code snippet in <\example_1\> contains privilege escalation bug. The code snippet in <\example_2\> contains price manipulation.
