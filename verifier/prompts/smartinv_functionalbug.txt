Please carefully study the following examples, pay special attention to cross bridge, and identify potential vulnerabilities in the contract at the end from the following possible vulnerabilities: 1)price manipulation; 2) privilege escalation; 3) business logic flaw; 4) inconsistent state update; 5) atomicity violation; 6) cross bridge inconsistency; 7) ID uniqueness violation; To provide examples, the code snippet in <\example_1\> contains privilege escalation bug. The code snippet in <\example_2\> contains price manipulation.

Please generate one of the followings: 1)price manipulation; 2) privilege escalation; 3) business logic flaw; 4) inconsistent state update; 5) atomicity violation;  6) cross bridge inconsistency; 7) ID uniqueness violation; 
Remember, your output should only include information from 1) to 7) that you identify in the following contract, NOT the examples above. Please do not output your reasoning about the examples. Remember, you MUST generate one of the 7 types, You CANNOT generate anything else. Please output healthy if a contract doesn't contain vulnerability.
