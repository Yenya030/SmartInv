Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle the update of proposal state consistently between the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

2) Business logic flaw: The requirement in the endExecute function to check if the locked funds are greater than half of the total supply of voting tokens could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

3) Atomicity violation: The contract is not ensuring atomicity in the execution of various functions, which could result in race conditions or vulnerabilities.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or vulnerabilities in the system.
