The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the execution has ended based on the time condition, but it does not take into account the actual completion of the proposed action. This could lead to issues if the proposed action is not completed even though the time has passed.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount variable without ensuring that it corresponds to the actual amount transferred. This may lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

3) Atomicity violation: The execute function transfers tokens and updates the votedAmount variable in separate steps, which could result in a scenario where the transfer succeeds but the variable update fails, leading to an inconsistent state.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could potentially lead to conflicts or unintended behavior if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously or have the same identifier.
