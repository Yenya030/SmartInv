Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount without proper synchronization or atomicity measures, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The startExecute function updates the startingBalanceList without proper validation or synchronization, which could result in inconsistencies in the data.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be a mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals or starting balances, potentially leading to conflicts or data corruption.
