Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is no check to ensure that the Proposal struct is properly updated in the startExecute function, potentially allowing for inconsistent state updates.
2) Privilege escalation: The execute function allows for the transfer of tokens without checking if the caller has the necessary privileges, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
4) Atomicity violation: The code in the execute function does not perform the token transfer and update of votedAmount atomically, leaving room for potential issues if the transfer fails after votedAmount is updated.
