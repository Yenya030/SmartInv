The contract provided for analysis is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The code in the contract does not properly update the state of the proposal before the execution, as the voted amount is increased without updating the proposal status appropriately.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract lacks proper synchronization between different components, such as the proposal, balance tracking, and execution, leading to potential inconsistencies and issues with cross-bridge interactions.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of ID clashes or lack of unique identification for proposals, which can lead to confusion and potential issues in tracking and managing multiple proposals simultaneously.
