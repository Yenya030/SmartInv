This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The startExecute function updates the proposal struct without ensuring that all necessary conditions are met, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute function performs multiple state changes without using appropriate atomicity mechanisms, which could result in unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The proposal struct is shared across multiple functions, increasing the risk of inconsistent data updates if not handled properly.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The proposal struct does not seem to have a unique identifier, which could potentially lead to conflicts or unintended overwriting of data.
