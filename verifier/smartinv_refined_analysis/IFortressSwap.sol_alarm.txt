Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update the state of the proposal before executing the function.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does not handle the transfer of tokens and state updates atomically, which can result in inconsistent data.
3) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function's logic for determining the success of execution based on the balance of tokens may not be appropriate and could lead to unexpected outcomes.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential for inconsistency in the state of the proposal and the execution process, which can lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized actions.
