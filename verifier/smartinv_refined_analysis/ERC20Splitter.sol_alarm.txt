Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the state variable `lockedFunds` consistently in the `endExecute()` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect data.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function performs multiple operations that involve transferring tokens and updating the `proposal` state without using any measures to ensure atomicity, which could result in inconsistencies or vulnerabilities.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of proper synchronization or checks between different functions in the contract, which could lead to inconsistencies or vulnerabilities in the data flow.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could result in duplicate or conflicting proposals being processed incorrectly.
