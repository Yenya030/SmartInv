Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function allows for the execution of proposals even if the conditions for ending execution have not been met, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct but does not ensure that the state is updated consistently, which could lead to incorrect data being stored.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes (transfer tokens, update voted amount, call votedProposal) without using proper mechanisms to ensure atomicity, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state if any operation fails.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `Proposal` struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously.
