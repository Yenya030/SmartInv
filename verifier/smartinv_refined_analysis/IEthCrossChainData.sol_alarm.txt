The contract provided for analysis is:

contract ExchangeTokens {
         IERC20 public WETH;
         IERC20 public USDC;
         function  calculatePrice() public payable returns (uint) {
             
            return (USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) /
             WETH.balanceOf(address(pair)));
      }
  }

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function may be vulnerable to price manipulation if the balance of USDC or WETH tokens held by the pair contract is tampered with to provide false price information.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of checks or validations in the function that could lead to inconsistent updating of price calculations based on potentially inaccurate token balances.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of address(pair) in calculating the price without verifying the legitimacy of the pair address can lead to inconsistencies and exploitability if attackers manipulate the pair address.
