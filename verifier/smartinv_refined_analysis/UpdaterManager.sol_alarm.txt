Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal, but it does not restrict multiple executions on the same proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `execute` function transfers tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract without proper validation, which can lead to inconsistencies in token balances.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to conflicts and confusion when processing multiple proposals.
