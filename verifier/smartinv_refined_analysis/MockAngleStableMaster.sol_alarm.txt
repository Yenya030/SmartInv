Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without checking for previous proposals, potentially allowing multiple proposals to be initiated simultaneously without proper handling.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The use of 'proposal' as a global variable without considering unique proposal IDs could lead to conflicts and errors if multiple proposals are created at the same time or under certain conditions.
3) Business logic flaw: The endExecute() function determines the execution status based on the balance comparison, which may not accurately reflect the success or failure of the execution process and can lead to incorrect outcomes.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, ID uniqueness violations, and business logic flaws.
