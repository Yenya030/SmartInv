The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the function `endExecute()` without any further action to ensure the consistency of the update.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function involves multiple state changes, but there is no mechanism to ensure that all these changes occur atomically.

3) Privilege escalation: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the contract to restrict certain functions to only authorized users, potentially leading to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with an external contract `IERC20` without explicitly defining the expected behavior of the external contract, which could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of an ID or identifier, which could lead to issues related to duplicate IDs.
