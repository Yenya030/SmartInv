Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() sets the proposal state without checking for any existing ongoing proposals. This could lead to inconsistent states if multiple proposals are created without completing the previous ones.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique proposal IDs in the contract, which could result in conflicts if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.

3) Atomicity violation: The function execute() updates the votedAmount state variable without using any atomic operation, opening up the possibility of race conditions and inconsistent data.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract uses external calls to interact with the votingToken contract, which can introduce inconsistencies and potential vulnerabilities if the external contract behaves unexpectedly or maliciously.

Overall, the contract exhibits vulnerabilities related to state management, ID uniqueness, atomicity, and external contract interactions.
