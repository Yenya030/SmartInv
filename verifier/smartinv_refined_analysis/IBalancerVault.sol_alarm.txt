The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without any proper synchronization or atomicity control, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The function `calculatePrice` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract relies on external state variables `WETH` and `USDC` without proper access control or checking, which could potentially lead to cross bridge inconsistencies.
