The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" in the Proposal struct is being updated in the execute function without any checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The execution of the execute function involves multiple state changes without proper atomicity guarantees, which could result in partial updates if an error occurs mid-way.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts (IERC20 interface), such as votingToken and pair, without sufficient checks on the consistency and integrity of the data being passed between them.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The use of addresses as identifiers in the startingBalanceList mapping may lead to potential ID uniqueness violations if there are duplicate addresses or collision issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, cross bridge inconsistency, and ID uniqueness violation.
