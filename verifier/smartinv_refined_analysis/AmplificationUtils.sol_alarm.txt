Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` without proper checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users, which could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
