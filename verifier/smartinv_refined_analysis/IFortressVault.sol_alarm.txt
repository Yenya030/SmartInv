The contract provided in the query is a TimeLockController contract, and potential vulnerabilities in this contract include:

1) Business logic flaw: There is a potential business logic flaw in the `endExecute` function where the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might not achieve the intended logic.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency in state update in the `execute` function where `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` might not accurately update the `votedAmount` variable.

3) Atomicity violation: There is a potential atomicity violation in the `startExecute` function where multiple state changes are made without ensuring atomicity.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is a potential violation of ID uniqueness if the same proposal ID is not properly managed and accounted for in the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and ID uniqueness violation.
