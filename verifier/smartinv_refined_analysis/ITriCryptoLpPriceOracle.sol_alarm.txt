The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" in the Proposal struct is directly modified in the execute function, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The execution flow involves calling external functions like transferFrom and balanceOf from the votingToken contract, which may introduce inconsistencies if these external calls fail or return unexpected results.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The proposal struct does not contain any unique identifier for each proposal, which may lead to ID uniqueness violations if multiple proposals are created without proper differentiation.
