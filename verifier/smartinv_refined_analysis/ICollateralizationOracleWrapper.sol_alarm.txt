Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not restrict who can call the execute function, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount variable is incremented without any checks or restrictions, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Atomicity violation: The votingToken.transferFrom function in the execute function is not wrapped in a try-catch block, which could lead to an atomicity violation if the transfer fails midway through the function execution.
