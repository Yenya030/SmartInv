The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper checks or validations, which may lead to inconsistent state of the contract.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or errors in the execution of proposals.
