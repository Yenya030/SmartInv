Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple instances where the state variables like proposal.votedAmount and proposal.sTime are updated without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The structure Proposal does not contain any unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to ID collision and potential vulnerabilities.
3) Privilege escalation: There are no checks in place to prevent unauthorized users from calling functions like execute and endExecute, potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks.
4) Business logic flaw: The business logic in functions like startExecute and endExecute could be improved to ensure proper execution flow and prevent unexpected behavior.
5) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts but lacks proper validation and error handling, which could lead to cross bridge inconsistency vulnerabilities.
