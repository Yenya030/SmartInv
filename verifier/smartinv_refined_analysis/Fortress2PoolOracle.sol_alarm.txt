The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state without checking if there is an existing proposal already ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function transfers tokens and updates the `proposal` state, but these operations are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, which could lead to inconsistencies if one operation fails.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not check for uniqueness of proposal ID, potentially allowing multiple proposals with the same ID to exist simultaneously.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and ID uniqueness violation.
