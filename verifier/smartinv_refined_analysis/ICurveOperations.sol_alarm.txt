Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle the updating of the `votedAmount` and `startingBalanceList` variables safely, which could lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce unique IDs for proposals, which could potentially lead to conflicts or unauthorized access to existing proposals.
