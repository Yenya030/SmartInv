Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes without using proper atomicity, which could result in unexpected behavior if an error occurs midway through the execution.
3) Privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any caller to initialize a new proposal, potentially leading to unauthorized privilege escalation.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could result in conflicts or incorrect behavior if multiple proposals share the same ID.
