The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that each `Proposal` struct has a unique identifier, which could result in ID uniqueness violations.
3) Business logic flaw: The logic for ending the execution in the `endExecute` function might not be correctly ensuring the proper conditions for execution, potentially leading to business logic flaws.
