The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Business logic flaw: The execution of a proposal is not properly verified, allowing for potential misuse of voting tokens.
2) Inconsistent state update: The way the votedAmount is updated in the execute function can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Atomicity violation: There is no atomic operation for updating the state variables, leaving room for unexpected behavior.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: There could be inconsistencies in the data related to proposals, especially when transferring tokens between addresses.
