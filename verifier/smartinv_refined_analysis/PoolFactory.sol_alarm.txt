Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` in the TimelockController contract updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The function `execute` in the TimelockController contract transfers tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract address without proper validation, potentially allowing for cross bridge inconsistency issues.
