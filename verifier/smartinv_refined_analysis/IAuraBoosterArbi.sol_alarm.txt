Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the state of both tokens atomically, which could lead to an inconsistent state if one transfer fails and the other succeeds.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract transfers one token first before transferring the other token, which can lead to inconsistencies if the second transfer fails after the first one has already been completed.
