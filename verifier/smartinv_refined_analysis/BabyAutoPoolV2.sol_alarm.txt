Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'startExecute' function updates the 'proposal' struct without checking if a previous proposal is already ongoing. This could lead to inconsistent state where multiple proposals are being started simultaneously.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, potentially leading to conflicts or confusion.
3) Privilege escalation: The 'execute' function allows the caller to transfer tokens without proper authorization, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers.
4) Business logic flaw: The 'endExecute' function calculates the success of an execution based on the balance of tokens held in the contract, which may not accurately reflect the actual success or failure of the execution.
