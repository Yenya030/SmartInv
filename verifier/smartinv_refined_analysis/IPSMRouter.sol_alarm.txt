Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The update of the proposal state in the startExecute function and the execute function is not consistent, as the startExecute function sets the votedAmount to 0, but the execute function increments it without checking for proper state transitions.

2) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the execute function, as the transferFrom function and the incrementing of votedAmount are not done atomically, leaving room for potential reentrancy attacks.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There does not seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to confusion or conflicts when multiple proposals are created.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates, atomicity violations, and ID uniqueness violations.
