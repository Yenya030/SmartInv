Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedProposal" function is mentioned in the code snippet, but its implementation is not provided. If the function performs state updates based on the proposal, there is a risk of inconsistent state if it is not implemented correctly.

2) Atomicity violation: The execution of the "execute" function involves multiple state changes (transferFrom, updating votedAmount, calling votedProposal). If any of these operations fail after others have already been executed, it can lead to an inconsistent state.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of the "votedAmount" and "proposal" structs can potentially lead to inconsistencies between them if not managed properly throughout the contract functions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique identification for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or errors if multiple proposals are created simultaneously or with the same ID.
