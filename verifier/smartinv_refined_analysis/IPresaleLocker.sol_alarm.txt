The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function in the contract updates the `votedAmount` without checking if the sender has the authorization to execute the function. This can lead to unauthorized changes in the state of the contract.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of validation or verification on the source of the `amount` being transferred in the `execute` function. This can lead to potential inconsistencies in the exchanged amount, causing financial losses.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check in place to ensure uniqueness of the `addr` field in the `Proposal` struct. This can lead to unexpected behavior if duplicate addresses are used in proposals.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, cross bridge inconsistency, and ID uniqueness violation.
