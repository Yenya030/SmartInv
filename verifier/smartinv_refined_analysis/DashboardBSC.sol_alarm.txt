Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized users from calling critical functions.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state updates as the `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper checks and balances.

3) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `endExecute` function are not atomic, leading to a potential vulnerability if multiple transactions are being processed concurrently.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for ID uniqueness when creating a new proposal, potentially leading to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
