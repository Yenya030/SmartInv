Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update:
   - The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the `votedProposal` event is emitted before updating the `proposal.votedAmount`, leading to a potential inconsistent state update.

2) Atomicity violation:
   - The `execute` function involves multiple state changes, like transferring tokens and updating the `proposal.votedAmount`, without utilizing the necessary mechanisms to ensure atomicity, potentially leading to atomicity violations.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency:
   - The `proposal` struct is not provided as a parameter in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions, making it possible for external calls to modify the state in unintended ways, potentially causing cross bridge inconsistencies. 

4) ID uniqueness violation:
   - The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier or compound key to differentiate between different proposals, which could lead to ID uniqueness violations and conflicts in the system.

It should be noted that the contract does not contain price manipulation, privilege escalation, business logic flaw, or other vulnerabilities listed.
