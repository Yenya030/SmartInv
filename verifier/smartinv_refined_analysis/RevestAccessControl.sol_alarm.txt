Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal is updated in the startExecute and execute functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data.

2) Privilege escalation: There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict certain functions to only be called by authorized users, allowing potential privilege escalation attacks.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract includes a reference to an interface IERC20, which may introduce cross-bridge inconsistency if the interface is changed in the future without updating the contract accordingly.
