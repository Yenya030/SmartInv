The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `lockedFunds` are being updated in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions respectively without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to restrict certain functions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute critical functions.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The code does not handle potential inconsistencies or conflicts that may arise when interacting with external contracts, such as the `votingToken` contract in the `execute` function.

4) Atomicity violation: The function `endExecute` performs multiple state-changing operations without proper atomicity checks, which could lead to unexpected outcomes if one of the operations fails midway.

5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in the system if multiple proposals share the same ID.
