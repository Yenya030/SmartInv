The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The contract allows for the execution of proposals based on the timing and the amount voted, which could potentially lead to incorrect execution of proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal and the executed amount are updated separately, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential risk of inconsistency in data transfer between different functions within the contract.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in the system.
