The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented in the `execute` function. However, if multiple calls are made to this function in quick succession, the state may become inconsistent due to the lack of proper synchronization or locking mechanisms.

2) Atomicity violation: The update of `proposal.votedAmount` and the call to `votedProposal` in the `execute` function are not atomic operations. If an external call is made between these two operations, it may lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not seem to have a unique identifier. This could potentially lead to conflicts or overriding of proposals if multiple proposals are created simultaneously.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and ID uniqueness violation.
