This contract potentially contains the following vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables (proposal) in different functions without ensuring consistency, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal IDs, which could result in conflicts or errors when managing multiple proposals.

3) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract perform multiple actions in sequence without employing proper atomic operations, which may lead to inconsistent states or vulnerabilities related to transaction ordering.
