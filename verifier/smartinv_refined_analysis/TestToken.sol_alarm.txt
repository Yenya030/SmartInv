The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract CrossBridge {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function swapTokens(uint amount) external {
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract performs two state updates in the `swapTokens` function, which can potentially lead to inconsistent state if one transfer succeeds and the other fails.
2) Atomicity violation: The `swapTokens` function lacks atomicity in the transfer operations, which could result in an incomplete swap if one transfer fails and the other succeeds.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks for duplicate transfers, leading to potential issues with ID uniqueness in the context of token transfers.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract facilitates token swaps between tokenA and tokenB without proper validation, raising concerns about potential inconsistencies or errors in the bridge mechanism.
