The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
3) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function does not properly check if the execution has ended before transferring locked funds, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
5) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the execute function, as the transfer and update of voted amount are not done atomically, leaving room for inconsistency.
7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to handle unique identifiers for proposals, which could potentially lead to conflicts or errors.
