The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "lockedFunds" is updated in the "endExecute" function without proper synchronization or validation, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential for cross bridge inconsistency when transferring tokens in the "execute" function without proper validation or checks, which can result in unintended behaviors or vulnerabilities.
