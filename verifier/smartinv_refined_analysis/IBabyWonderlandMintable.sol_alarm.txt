Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The function `execute` does not check if the caller is authorized to execute the proposal. This could lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

3) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` transfers tokens and updates the `votedAmount` in separate steps without using proper atomicity mechanisms. This could lead to atomicity violations.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract uses an external contract (`IERC20`) without explicitly verifying the external contract's behavior. This could lead to inconsistencies if the external contract behaves unexpectedly.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could result in overwrite or confusion of proposals.

Overall, the contract appears to have multiple potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
