Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update in the `execute` function where `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without proper synchronization.
2) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not properly atomic, which could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple transactions try to execute at the same time.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is called without any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of the proposal ID, which could lead to confusion or incorrect data handling.
