This contract may have potential vulnerabilities: 

1) inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates. 

2) atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple operations without ensuring that they all succeed or fail together, potentially leading to atomicity violations. 

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
