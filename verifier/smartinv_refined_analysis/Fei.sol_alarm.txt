The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or handling of race conditions, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The `endExecute` function performs multiple operations sequentially without ensuring that they are performed atomically. This can result in an inconsistent state if one of the operations fails midway through execution.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier for each proposal, which can lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are created simultaneously without proper identification.
