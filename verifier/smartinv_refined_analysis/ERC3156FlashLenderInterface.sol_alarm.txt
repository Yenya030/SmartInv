The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without checking if a proposal is already in progress, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() transfers tokens from the proposal.addr to the contract before updating the votedAmount, which could result in atomicity violation if the transfer fails after tokens have been deducted.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which could lead to ID uniqueness violation if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.

4) Business logic flaw: The endExecute() function could potentially fail to execute properly if the condition for checking if execution has not ended is not set correctly, leading to a business logic flaw.
