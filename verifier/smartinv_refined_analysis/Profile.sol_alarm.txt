Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute()` function without proper synchronization measures, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Cross-bridge inconsistency: The `votingToken.transferFrom()` function is called in the `execute()` function without proper checks and balances, potentially leading to inconsistencies between the token balances and the proposed changes.
