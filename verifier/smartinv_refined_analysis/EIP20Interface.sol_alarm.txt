Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The startExecute function updates the startingBalanceList without proper validation or synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent data state.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute function involves multiple operations (transferFrom, adding to votedAmount, calling votedProposal) without utilizing a mechanism to ensure atomicity. This can result in partial execution of the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of validation for cross-contract calls in the execute function, where the contract interacts with the votingToken contract. This can introduce inconsistency in the data flow and compromise the integrity of the contract.
