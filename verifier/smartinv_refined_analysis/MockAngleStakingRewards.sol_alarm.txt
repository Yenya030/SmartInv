Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: There are multiple actions being performed within the functions startExecute and execute without proper atomicity checks, leading to potential issues if one action fails while others succeed.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The use of proposal as a state variable without proper ID uniqueness checks could lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously or with the same ID.

4) Business logic flaw: The execute function allows for voting to be done before the specified time has passed, potentially allowing for manipulation of the voting process.

5) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of different state variables and functions without clear consistency checks can lead to cross bridge inconsistencies in the contract.
