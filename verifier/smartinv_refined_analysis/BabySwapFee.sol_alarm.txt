The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring proper synchronization to prevent potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts such as `IERC20` without adequate checks or validations, leaving room for possible inconsistencies or errors in communication between different contracts.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not explicitly handle unique identifiers for proposals, which could lead to potential conflicts or issues if multiple proposals with the same identifier are introduced.
