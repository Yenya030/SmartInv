The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute()` function updates the `proposal` state without considering any checks or validations that could potentially lead to incorrect state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function transfers tokens and updates the `votedAmount` in multiple separate steps, which could lead to inconsistencies if the state is not updated atomically.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal()` function is mentioned but not defined in the contract. If this function involves keeping track of unique identifiers for proposals, there could be a violation of ID uniqueness if not implemented correctly.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of multiple separate functions to handle different parts of the proposal execution could potentially lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior if the interactions between these functions are not carefully managed.
