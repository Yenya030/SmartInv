The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` field of the `proposal` struct, but it does not ensure that this update is atomic. If multiple transactions try to update the `votedAmount` field simultaneously, it could lead to inconsistent state.

2) Privilege escalation: The `owner` address is declared as internal, but it is not being properly checked or controlled throughout the contract. This could lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure that the IDs assigned to proposals are unique. This could lead to potential issues if duplicate IDs are generated.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, and ID uniqueness violation.
