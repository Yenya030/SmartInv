Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute sets the startingBlance variable without initializing it, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
