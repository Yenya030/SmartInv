The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state without ensuring proper synchronization or atomicity.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in the application logic.
