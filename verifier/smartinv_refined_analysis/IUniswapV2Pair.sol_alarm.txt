Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct without ensuring proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data state.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function transfers tokens and updates the `votedAmount` without using proper atomicity checks, which can result in partial execution and unexpected behavior.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is called without any checks for unique identifiers, which can lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are executed simultaneously.
