The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function appears to update the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract's token holdings, but does not provide any logic to account for any potential changes in the token balance during the execution process. This could result in an inconsistent state of the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple separate operations, such as transferring tokens and updating the proposal's voted amount. If an error occurs midway through these operations, it could lead to an inconsistent or incomplete state of the contract.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential for inconsistency in the state of the contract due to the lack of synchronized updates between the various functions within the contract. In particular, the `execute` function updates the voted amount in the proposal without ensuring that the `votedProposal` function is called to properly record the vote.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and cross bridge inconsistency.
