Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `startingBalanceList` is being updated in the `startExecute` function without proper validation or synchronization, which could lead to inconsistencies across different parts of the contract.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal.addr` is being used as a unique identifier for proposals without proper validation for uniqueness, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, cross bridge inconsistencies, and ID uniqueness violations.
