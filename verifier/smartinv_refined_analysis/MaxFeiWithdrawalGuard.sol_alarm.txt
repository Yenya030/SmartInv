The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions do not implement a fully secure timelock mechanism, which could lead to potential issues with proposal execution.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` and `proposal.sTime` are updated in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization or atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with the `votingToken` contract, which could potentially introduce cross bridge inconsistency issues if the token contract has vulnerabilities.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping uses the `proposal.addr` as a key, which could lead to ID uniqueness violations if the same address is used for multiple proposals.
