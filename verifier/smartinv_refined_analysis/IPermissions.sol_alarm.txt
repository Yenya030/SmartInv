Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, leading to a potential inconsistent state update vulnerability.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes (transfer of tokens, updating `votedAmount`, calling `votedProposal`), but there is no implementation of atomicity to ensure that all changes occur together or none at all.
3) Privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any caller to initiate a new proposal without proper access control or permission checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
