Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct without using proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent states.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The endExecute function checks the balance of the contract and total token supply without verifying the token types, which could lead to inconsistencies if different token types are involved in the calculation.
