Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple variables being updated within functions without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent states.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential for inconsistent data or actions between different parts of the contract, leading to unexpected behavior.
