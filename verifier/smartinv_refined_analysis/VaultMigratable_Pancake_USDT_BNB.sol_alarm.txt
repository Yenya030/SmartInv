Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` struct but does not consider the case where a new proposal is being initiated before the previous one has been completed or invalidated.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier for each proposal, potentially leading to confusion or conflicts when multiple proposals are being handled simultaneously.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes (transfer and update `proposal`), but these changes are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, making the contract vulnerable to inconsistency if one of the operations fails.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with the `votingToken` contract, but there is a lack of validation or verification to ensure that the interaction is secure and consistent, leaving room for vulnerabilities such as token manipulation or unauthorized access.

5) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks for the balance of tokens held by the contract against the total supply, but the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` seems incorrect and may lead to unexpected behavior or unintended consequences.
