Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is incremented in the 'execute' function without proper synchronization measures, which could lead to inconsistent updates of the state variable.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The 'startExecute' function stores the starting balance of a proposal in 'startingBalanceList', but it is not clear how this information is used or updated elsewhere in the contract, potentially leading to inconsistencies between different parts of the system.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The 'proposal' struct does not contain a unique identifier for each proposal, which could result in conflicts or overlapping data if multiple proposals are created simultaneously or in quick succession.

Overall, the contract may be susceptible to various vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, cross-bridge inconsistencies, and ID uniqueness violations.
