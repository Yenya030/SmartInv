The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update - The `lockedFunds` variable is updated without any synchronization mechanism, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation - There is no check to ensure that the `proposal.addr` is unique, which may lead to ID uniqueness violations.
