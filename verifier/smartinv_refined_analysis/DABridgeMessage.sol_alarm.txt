The contract provided for analysis is:

contract ExchangeTokens {
    IERC20 public WETH;
    IERC20 public USDC;
    function  calculatePrice() public payable returns (uint) {
             
        return (USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) /
        WETH.balanceOf(address(pair)));
    }
}

Based on the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities that can be identified are:
