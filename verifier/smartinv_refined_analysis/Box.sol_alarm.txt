The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` variable is being updated directly in the `execute` function without checking if the sender has the authority to do so or verifying the integrity of the transaction. This can lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The execution of the `execute` function is not atomic, meaning that the updates to `proposal.votedAmount` and the `votedProposal` event emit can be interrupted by external actions, leading to potential issues with data integrity.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could potentially lead to conflicts or data corruption if multiple proposals are started simultaneously.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to exploitation due to these identified vulnerabilities.
