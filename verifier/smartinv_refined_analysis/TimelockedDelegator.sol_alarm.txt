The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without considering the current state of the proposal, which can lead to inconsistent data.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of the proposal ID, which may lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are submitted with the same ID.

3) Atomicity violation: The function execute() updates multiple variables without using any atomic operations, leaving the contract vulnerable to race conditions.

4) Business logic flaw: The function endExecute() checks if the execution of a proposal has failed based on a condition that might not be a reliable indicator of success or failure, leading to incorrect outcomes.
