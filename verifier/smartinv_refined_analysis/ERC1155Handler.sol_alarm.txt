Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The proposal struct's votedAmount is directly updated in the execute function without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which can lead to inconsistent data updates.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with an external contract IERC20 without proper validation or ensuring the consistency of data between the two contracts, which can lead to unexpected behavior or inconsistencies.
