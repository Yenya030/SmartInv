The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct before updating the `startingBalanceList`, which could lead to inconsistent state if an error occurs after updating `proposal` but before updating `startingBalanceList`.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` updates the `proposal` struct and transfers tokens in separate steps, which could potentially result in a situation where tokens are transferred but the `proposal` struct is not updated correctly.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not seem to have a unique identifier associated with each proposal, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are created or processed at the same time.

Overall, it is recommended to review the contract to address these potential vulnerabilities and ensure the contract's security and functionality.
