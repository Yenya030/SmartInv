Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly in the `execute` function without properly handling state changes in a secure and consistent manner. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploit vulnerabilities.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs. This could result in conflicts or discrepancies if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `proposal.addr` is assigned directly from `msg.sender` without proper validation or authentication, potentially leading to inconsistency or unauthorized access issues.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, ID uniqueness violation, and cross bridge inconsistency.
