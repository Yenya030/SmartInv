There are potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state of the `proposal` struct without checking if the caller has the necessary privileges to do so.

2) Privilege escalation: The same function `startExecute` allows any external account to start a proposal without proper authorization checks.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without using any atomic operations, which could lead to inconsistent data if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could lead to conflicts or confusion in the system.

Overall, the contract has multiple potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
