The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains multiple functions that modify state variables such as `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` without ensuring that the state updates are performed atomically. This can lead to inconsistent state if multiple functions are called simultaneously.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not implement any checks to ensure that `proposal` IDs are unique. This could potentially result in conflicts or errors if two proposals are created with the same ID.

3) Atomicity violation: The contract does not use any mechanisms to ensure atomicity of operations, particularly in the `execute` function where multiple state changes are made sequentially without any protection against reentrancy or external interference.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and atomicity violation.
