The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` in the `endExecute` function might have a business logic flaw that could lead to unexpected behavior. 

3) Privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any caller to propose a new proposal without proper authorization checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
