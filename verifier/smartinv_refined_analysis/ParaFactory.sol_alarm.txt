The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function without considering the possibility of reentrancy attack or other potential issues related to updating state variables.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping is using the `proposal.addr` as a key, which may lead to ID uniqueness violation if the same address is used for multiple proposals.
