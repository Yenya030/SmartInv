The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without ensuring that it is in a consistent state, potentially leading to issues with the proposal data.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or inconsistencies in the data stored for different proposals.

3) Privilege escalation: There is a potential for privilege escalation if proper access control mechanisms are not in place to restrict certain functions from unauthorized users.

4) Business logic flaw: There may be business logic flaws present in the contract that could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

5) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract may not handle cross-bridge transactions consistently or securely, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in transferring tokens between different blockchains or networks.
