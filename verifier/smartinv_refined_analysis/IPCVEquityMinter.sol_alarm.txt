Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being directly incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Atomicity violation: The state changes in the `execute` function are not being handled atomically, potentially leading to partial execution of the function.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of `proposal` IDs, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
