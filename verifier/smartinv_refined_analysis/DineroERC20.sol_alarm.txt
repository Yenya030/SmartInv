Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains multiple state variables that are being updated in different functions without enforcing proper synchronization mechanisms. This could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract perform multiple state changes without wrapping them in a single atomic operation. This could result in partial state changes if an error occurs midway through the function execution.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts without proper validation or verification, which could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior due to differences in implementation between contracts.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of identifiers for proposals or other elements, which could potentially lead to conflicts or data corruption.

5) Business logic flaw: The contract's logic for executing proposals and ending executions may contain flaws that could be exploited to manipulate the contract's behavior or lead to unintended consequences.
