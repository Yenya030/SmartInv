The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a transaction or any form of atomicity guarantee, which can lead to issues if one operation succeeds while the other fails.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `votingToken.transferFrom` operation in the `execute` function interacts with an external contract, which may result in inconsistency if the external contract behaves unexpectedly or maliciously.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping stores starting balances for different addresses, but there is no uniqueness check or validation for address IDs, which may lead to unexpected behavior if duplicate IDs exist.
