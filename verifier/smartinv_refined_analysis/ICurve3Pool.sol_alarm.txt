Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal without ensuring that the previous proposal has been completed or reverted. This can lead to inconsistent data within the contract.
2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() performs multiple state-changing operations without ensuring that they are executed atomically. This can result in partial updates being applied, leading to unexpected behavior.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that proposal IDs are unique, which can lead to conflicts and confusion in the event of multiple proposals occurring simultaneously.
