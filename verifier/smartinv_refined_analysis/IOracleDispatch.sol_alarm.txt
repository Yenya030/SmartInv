The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedProposal(proposal)` function is called after updating `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function, which may lead to inconsistent state.

2) Privilege escalation: The `endExecute` function does not check if the caller is the owner of the contract, allowing anyone to potentially end the execution process.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or errors in the proposal handling process.
