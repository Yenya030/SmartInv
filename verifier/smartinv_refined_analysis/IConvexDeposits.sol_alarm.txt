The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without locking the state modification, which can lead to inconsistent data if multiple transactions try to modify the same state variable concurrently. 
2) ID uniqueness violation: There are no mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could potentially lead to conflicts or errors when handling multiple proposals with the same ID.
