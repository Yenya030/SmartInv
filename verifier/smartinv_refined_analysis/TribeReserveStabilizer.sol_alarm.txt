The contract provided for analysis:

```
contract CrossBridge {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function swapTokens(uint amount, address recipient) public {
        tokenA.transferFrom(recipient, address(this), amount);
        tokenB.transfer(recipient, amount);
    }

    function depositTokenA(uint amount) public {
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function withdrawTokenB(uint amount, address recipient) public {
        tokenB.transfer(recipient, amount);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `swapTokens` function does not ensure that the transfer of `tokenA` and `tokenB` occurs atomically, potentially leading to an inconsistent state if one transfer fails.
2) Atomicity violation: If an external function call is made after `tokenA.transferFrom` in the `swapTokens` function that changes the contract's state, it could result in an atomicity violation.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential risk of inconsistency in token swaps between `tokenA` and `tokenB` within the contract.
4) ID uniqueness violation: Depending on how `recipient` addresses are generated, there might be a risk of ID uniqueness violation if duplicate addresses are used for different transactions.
