The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract Bridge {
     address public tokenA;
     address public tokenB;

     function crossBridge(uint amount) external {
         //logic for swapping tokens
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Bridge contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the contract might become inconsistent if the swapping logic in the crossBridge function does not update the state variables (tokenA and tokenB) correctly.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: There might be inconsistencies in the swapping process between tokenA and tokenB if the function does not handle the cross-bridge transaction securely.
3) Business logic flaw: The swapping logic within the crossBridge function may have a flaw that could lead to unexpected behavior or malicious actions.
4) Atomicity violation: The swapping process may not be atomic, leading to partial or failed swaps, potentially causing loss of funds or tokens.
