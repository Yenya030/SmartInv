The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization measures, potentially leading to inconsistent data. 

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `endExecute` function tries to assess the execution success by comparing the balance of the contract with two times the total supply, which may lead to an incorrect evaluation of the execution outcome. 

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `Proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier for each proposal, which could lead to conflicts or confusion in managing multiple proposals.
