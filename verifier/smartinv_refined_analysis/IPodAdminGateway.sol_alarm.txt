Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates as the startingBalanceList is updated in the startExecute function, but it is not clear how and when it is accessed or used in other parts of the contract. This could lead to unexpected behavior or exploitation.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs. This could potentially lead to conflicts or errors when managing multiple proposals in the contract.
