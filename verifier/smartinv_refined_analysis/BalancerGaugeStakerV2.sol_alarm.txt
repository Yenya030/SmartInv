Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper checks or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state values.
2) Atomicity violation: The `votingToken.transferFrom` and `proposal.votedAmount += amount` operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, potentially leading to atomicity violations.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for duplicate proposals, which could lead to ID uniqueness violations and conflicts in the system.
