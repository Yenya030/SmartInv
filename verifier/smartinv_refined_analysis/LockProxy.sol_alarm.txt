The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without proper validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure uniqueness of the proposal ID, which may result in conflicts.
3) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the execution has ended based on a timestamp without considering potential delays or outside influences.
4) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes within the `execute` function without proper atomicity checks, which may result in partial updates in case of failures.
