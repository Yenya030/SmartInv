The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any checks to ensure that the same ID is not used for multiple proposals, which could lead to confusion or errors in the system.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state changes happening within the same function without proper checks or synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.

3) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract do not have proper mechanisms to ensure atomicity of operations, which could result in partial completion of operations and leave the contract in inconsistent states.

4) Privilege escalation: The contract may be susceptible to privilege escalation attacks, where an unauthorized user could gain access to functions or data that they should not have permissions for.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and privilege escalation.
