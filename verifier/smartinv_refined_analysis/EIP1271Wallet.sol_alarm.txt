The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is being updated without proper synchronization or atomicity checks. This can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the `votedAmount` variable simultaneously.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `votingToken.transferFrom` function in the `execute` function allows the `proposal.addr` to transfer tokens to the contract without proper checks or validations. This can potentially lead to inconsistency or unexpected behavior in the system.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` is being updated without checking for unique IDs, which could lead to overwriting existing data and causing unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, cross bridge inconsistency, and ID uniqueness violation.
