Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function sets the `proposal` struct without any checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does multiple state changes (transfer tokens, update votedAmount, call votedProposal) without proper atomicity checks, which could result in partially completed operations.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of proper synchronization between the different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) that interact with the `proposal` state, leading to potential inconsistencies.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of the proposals generated in the `startExecute` function, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
