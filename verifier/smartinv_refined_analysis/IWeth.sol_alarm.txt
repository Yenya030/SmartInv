Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation bug: The contract relies on the `proposal` struct to determine ownership and execution of functions, potentially allowing for unauthorized access to execute functions.
- Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` and `execute` functions, the `proposal` state is updated without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.
- Atomicity violation: The `execute` function updates multiple variables without proper atomicity, potentially leading to race conditions and unexpected behavior.
