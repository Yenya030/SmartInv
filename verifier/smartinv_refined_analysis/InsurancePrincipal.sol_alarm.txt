The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state without ensuring that previous proposals have been properly finalized.
   
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not include a unique identifier, which could lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are submitted simultaneously.

3) Privilege escalation: The `execute` function allows the `msg.sender` to execute proposals, which may lead to unauthorized parties tampering with the execution process.
