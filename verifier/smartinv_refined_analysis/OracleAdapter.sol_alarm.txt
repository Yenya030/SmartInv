Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without ensuring that the previous proposal has been properly closed or handled. This could lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behaviors.
2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function performs multiple operations without atomicity, which could lead to unexpected results if one operation fails while the others succeed.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract includes a reference to the IERC20 interface, which suggests a cross-bridge functionality. If this bridge is not implemented securely, it could introduce vulnerabilities related to data consistency and integrity.
