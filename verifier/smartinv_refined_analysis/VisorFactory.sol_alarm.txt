Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() is updating the state variable proposal.votedAmount without using any synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent data.

2) Privilege escalation: The owner of the contract is not properly defined or checked in the code, which could lead to unauthorized access to critical functions by malicious actors.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of validation or checks for data consistency when transferring tokens between the contract and external addresses, which could result in inconsistencies in the token balances.

4) Business logic flaw: The condition in the endExecute() function for checking if the execution has ended may not be correctly implemented, potentially leading to incorrect execution outcomes.

5) Atomicity violation: The functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() are performing multiple state changes without utilizing any mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which could result in partial state updates in case of failures.
