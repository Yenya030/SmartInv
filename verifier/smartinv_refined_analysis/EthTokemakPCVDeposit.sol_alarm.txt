The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without any checks or protections, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: Multiple state changes are made in the `execute` function without utilizing proper atomicity measures, which may result in unexpected behavior in case of reentrancy or other concurrency issues.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of `votingToken.transferFrom` in the `execute` function without proper verification or risk assessment may expose the contract to cross-bridge inconsistencies.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and cross-bridge inconsistency.
