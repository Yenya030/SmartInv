The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: In the function `endExecute`, the variable `lockedFunds` is being updated without any proper validation or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: In the function `execute`, multiple state changes occur without being executed atomically. If an exception happens between these state changes, the contract may end up in an inconsistent state.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
