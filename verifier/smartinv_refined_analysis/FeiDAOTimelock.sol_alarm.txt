Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables that are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization or validation checks, potentially leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

2) Atomicity violation: The contract does not use any mechanisms like locks or modifiers to ensure atomicity of operations, which could result in race conditions or unexpected behavior if multiple functions are called simultaneously.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There are references to proposal addresses without ensuring their uniqueness, which could lead to confusion or incorrect behavior if duplicate addresses are used or if addressing conflicts arise.

4) Business logic flaw: There may be potential logical flaws in the contract's flow and decision-making process, which could lead to unintended actions or vulnerabilities being exploited.
