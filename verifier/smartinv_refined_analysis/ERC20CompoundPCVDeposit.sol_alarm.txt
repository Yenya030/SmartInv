Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the caller of the `startExecute` function to become the owner of the proposal, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` of the proposal is updated without proper synchronization or atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of clear communication or synchronization between the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions, which could result in inconsistencies across different parts of the contract.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have a mechanism to ensure unique proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
