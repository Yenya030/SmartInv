The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update within the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute as they manipulate proposal's state without using proper synchronization mechanisms.
2) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing potential privilege escalation by unauthorized users.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure the uniqueness of proposals' IDs, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
4) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the execution of functions, which may result in unexpected outcomes or vulnerabilities.
5) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract does not handle potential inconsistencies that may arise when interacting with external contracts or systems, leading to a cross bridge inconsistency vulnerability.
