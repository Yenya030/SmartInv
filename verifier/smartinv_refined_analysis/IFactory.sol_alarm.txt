Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: the execution of the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute can lead to inconsistent state updates, especially with the manipulation of proposal variables.
- Business logic flaw: there may be business logic flaws in the execution of startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions, leading to unexpected behavior in the contract.
- Atomicity violation: there is a lack of atomicity in the execution of the functions, which could result in inconsistent execution of multiple operations.
- ID uniqueness violation: the lack of unique identifiers for proposals and addresses could lead to conflicts or duplication of data.
