The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function 'startExecute' updates the state variables 'proposal' and 'startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]' in a way that may lead to inconsistent data if multiple calls are made concurrently.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The function 'execute' interacts with the 'proposal' state variable, which can be modified by multiple users or contracts, potentially leading to inconsistency or unexpected behavior.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no clear mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of 'proposal' identifiers, which could result in conflicts or unintended consequences when managing proposals.
