Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call the execute function and potentially manipulate proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function does not properly update the state of the proposal, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the data.
3) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes happening in the execute function without proper atomicity, which can lead to unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with the votingToken contract without ensuring that the state updates are synchronized with the votingToken contract, leading to potential inconsistency issues.
