Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `startExecute` function updates the state of the `startingBalanceList` without providing any validation or checks on the input data, potentially leading to inconsistent or incorrect state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The `endExecute` function does not include any access control mechanism to restrict who can call it, allowing potential malicious actors to prematurely end the execution without proper authorization.

3) Cross bridge inconsistency: The use of multiple external contracts and functions for interaction (such as `votingToken.transferFrom` and `votedProposal`) may introduce inconsistencies or desynchronization between different parts of the contract, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
