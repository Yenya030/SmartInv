Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or validation, leading to a potential inconsistent state update vulnerability.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes without using proper locking mechanisms, potentially leading to atomicity violations and unexpected behavior.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check in place to ensure that each proposal has a unique identifier, which could lead to ID duplication and conflicts within the contract.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `votingToken.transferFrom` function in the `execute` function could be vulnerable to cross-bridge inconsistencies if the external token contract behaves unexpectedly or maliciously.

5) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function has a business logic vulnerability where the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` may not accurately represent the intended logic, leading to potential issues in the contract execution flow.
