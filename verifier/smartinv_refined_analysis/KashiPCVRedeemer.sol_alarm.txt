The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state variable `proposal` without properly initializing it, which could lead to inconsistent data.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute()` performs multiple state changes without using any locking mechanisms, which could result in inconsistent state if multiple calls are made simultaneously.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or incorrect data association.

4) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place to restrict certain functions to only authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized access and manipulation of critical functions or data.
