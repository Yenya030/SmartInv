The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function may have a logic flaw where the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` might not securely validate the execution state.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function may have a state update inconsistency as it updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring it is done atomically, potentially leading to incorrect balances.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does not perform atomic operations when updating `proposal.votedAmount`, which can lead to race conditions and inconsistent data.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no explicit checks to ensure that the proposals' addresses do not conflict or violate uniqueness, which may lead to unexpected behaviors.

5) Cross-bridge inconsistency: The use of multiple proposals and balances without proper synchronization mechanisms can result in inconsistent data across different parts of the contract.
