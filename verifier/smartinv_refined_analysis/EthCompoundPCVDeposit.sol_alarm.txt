The contract you provided for analysis:
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The logic of the startExecute function may potentially be incorrect as it checks if the proposal has started based on the sTime field, but then sets sTime to the current block timestamp. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount of the proposal is updated without any checks or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes happening within the execute function without any mechanism to ensure atomicity, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state if any of the transactions fail.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to handle uniqueness of Proposal IDs, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.

Please review and address these potential vulnerabilities in the contract.
