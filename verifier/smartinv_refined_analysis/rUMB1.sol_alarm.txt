Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent State Update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates under certain conditions.
2) Cross Bridge Inconsistency: The contract uses an external token (votingToken) for transfers and balances, which could lead to inconsistency issues if the external token contract has vulnerabilities or is manipulated.
3) ID Uniqueness Violation: The use of proposal.addr as an identifier for startingBalanceList could lead to ID uniqueness violations if multiple proposals are initiated by the same address, causing conflicts in tracking starting balances.
