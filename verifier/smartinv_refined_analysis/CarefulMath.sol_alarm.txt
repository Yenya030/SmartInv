The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variables proposal.votedAmount and proposal.votedProposal are being updated without proper checks which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Cross bridge inconsistency: The function startExecute() and endExecute() are dependent on the state of the proposal which can lead to inconsistencies if called in an unexpected order or by unauthorized users.
