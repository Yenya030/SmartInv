Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable without checking if the conditions are met, which could lead to inconsistent states.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the liquidate() function could potentially result in an integer overflow if the values are not properly constrained.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables WETH, USDC, and pair is set to public, which could expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access.
4) Business logic flaw: The liquidate() function's condition for liquidation might not cover all possible scenarios, leading to unintended behavior.
5) Insufficient gas: If the execution of functions requires a significant amount of gas, there could be a risk of running out of gas during the transaction.
