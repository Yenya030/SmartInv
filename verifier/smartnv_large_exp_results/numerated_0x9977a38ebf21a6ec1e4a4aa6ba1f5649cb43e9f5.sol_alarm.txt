The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSwap {
         IERC20 public token1;
         IERC20 public token2;

         function swap(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
             token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
             token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
         }
}

List of potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not check for the success of both token transfers before updating the state, which could lead to an inconsistent state if one transfer fails.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of token2.transfer in the swap function should be specified as public for external parties to access it.
3) Insufficient gas: The swap function may require more gas than specified, leading to a failed transaction if not enough gas is provided.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
