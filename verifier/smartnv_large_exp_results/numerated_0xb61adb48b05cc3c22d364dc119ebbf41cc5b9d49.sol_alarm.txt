Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to potential issues with identification and tracking of proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is being updated in the 'endExecute' function without clear indication of its purpose or how it is related to the overall functionality of the contract, which could lead to inconsistencies in state updates.
