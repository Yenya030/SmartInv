<output>
Corrected vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure uniqueness of voter addresses, leading to potential issues with multiple votes from the same address.
2) Business logic flaw: The voting system allows negative votes, which might not align with the intended functionality.
