The contract provided for analysis:
```
contract Voting {
   struct Voter {
       uint weight;
       bool voted;
       address delegate;
       uint vote;
   }
   
   mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
   address public admin;

   function delegate(address to) public {
       Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
       require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted");
       require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed");

       while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
           to = voters[to].delegate;
           require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation");
       }
       sender.voted = true;
       sender.delegate = to;
   }

   function vote(uint option) public {
       Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
       require(sender.weight > 0, "No right to vote");
       require(!sender.voted, "Already voted");

       sender.voted = true;
       sender.vote = option;
   }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
2) Inconsistent state update

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership and inconsistent state update.
