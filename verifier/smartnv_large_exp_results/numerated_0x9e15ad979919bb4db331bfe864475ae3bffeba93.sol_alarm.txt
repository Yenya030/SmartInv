The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract at the end of execution, but it doesn't ensure that the state changes are consistent with the overall intent of the contract. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms such as restricting certain functions to only be called by specific addresses. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical functions and data in the contract.
