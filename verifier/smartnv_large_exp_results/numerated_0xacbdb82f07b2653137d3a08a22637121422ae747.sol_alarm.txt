This contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `startingBlance` is misspelled as `startingBalance` when updating the state in the `startExecute` function.
2) Missing access control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the functions, allowing anyone to call them.
3) No input validation: The `execute` function does not validate the input `amount` parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
4) Lack of event logging: There are no event logs emitted in the contract, making it harder to track contract actions and state changes.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, missing access control, lack of input validation, and missing event logging.
