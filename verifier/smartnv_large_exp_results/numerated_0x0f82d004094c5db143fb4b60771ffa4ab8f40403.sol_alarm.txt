The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    mapping(address => uint256) public voteCount;
    address public admin;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote() external {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted.");
        voteCount[msg.sender]++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) external {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin.");
        admin = newAdmin;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract could include:
- Privilege escalation
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
