The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute" updates the proposal state without checking for the current state, potentially allowing for unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not define all the functions required by the interface, possibly leading to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
