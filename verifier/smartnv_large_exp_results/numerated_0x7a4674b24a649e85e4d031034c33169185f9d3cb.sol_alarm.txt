Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is claiming to implement the IERC20 interface but does not provide any implementation of the interface functions. This can lead to issues related to contract ownership and visibility.

2) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute sets the proposal variable but does not ensure that the proposal has not been set before, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Reentrancy: The execute function calls external functions (votingToken.transferFrom and votedProposal) before updating the state variable proposal.votedAmount, which can allow for reentrancy attacks.

4) Integer overflow: In the function endExecute, the expression votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 may lead to an integer overflow if the balance of the token is large enough, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

5) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves querying balances from external contracts (votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))), which may require significant gas and result in out-of-gas errors.

6) Privilege escalation: There is no proper access control mechanism in place to limit who can call certain functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
