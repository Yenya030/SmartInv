The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without ensuring that the proposal has successfully executed, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is not implemented correctly in the TimelockController contract, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership permissions.
