Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from initiating and executing proposals, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are scenarios where the state variables are updated without proper validation or synchronization, leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail due to insufficient gas if the execution of certain operations consumes more gas than available, potentially causing the function to fail unexpectedly.
