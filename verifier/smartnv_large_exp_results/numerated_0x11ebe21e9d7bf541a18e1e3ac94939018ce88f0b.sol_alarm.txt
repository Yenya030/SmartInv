1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable should be private to prevent unauthorized access to the owner address.

2) Inconsistent state update: The totalAmount variable should be modified within lock mechanism to avoid inconsistent updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas if the totalAmount becomes too large, leading to potential issues in processing transactions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the "PaymentContract" contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas.
