The contract provided for analysis:
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
    }
    address internal owner;
    IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
        uint256 startingBalance;
        require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
        proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
        startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
        startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 
    }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
        require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
        votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
        proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
        votedProposal(proposal); 
    }

    function endExecute() external {
        require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
        require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
        lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}


The potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not explicitly declared or defined, which could potentially lead to issues related to visibility and ownership within the contract logic.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being modified in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`), which could lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.
3) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the `votingToken` contract is greater than twice the total supply, which could potentially have unintended consequences or lead to incorrect execution logic.
