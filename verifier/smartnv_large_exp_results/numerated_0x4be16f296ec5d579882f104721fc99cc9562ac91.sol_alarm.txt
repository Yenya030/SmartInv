The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

5) atomicity violation: The contract does not use any locking mechanisms to ensure atomicity of operations, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are executed simultaneously.

7) ID uniqueness violation: There is potential for ID uniqueness violation as the contract does not have a mechanism to ensure that IDs assigned to proposals are unique.

14) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not properly defined, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract data by external parties.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
