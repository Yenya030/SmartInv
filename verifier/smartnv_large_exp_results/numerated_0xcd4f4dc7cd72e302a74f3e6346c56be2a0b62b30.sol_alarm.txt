contract Escrow {
     address public payer;
     address public payee;
     address public arbiter;
     uint public amount;
     enum State {Created, Locked, Released, Inactive}
     State public state;

     constructor(address _payer, address _payee, address _arbiter, uint _amount) public {
          payer = _payer;
          payee = _payee;
          arbiter = _arbiter;
          amount = _amount;
          state = State.Created;
     }
     
     function lockFunds() public {
          require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can lock funds");
          state = State.Locked;
     }
     
     function releaseFunds() public {
          require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
          require(state == State.Locked, "Funds are not locked");
          payee.transfer(amount);
          state = State.Released;
     }
} 

The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The lockFunds function doesn't restrict access to only the payer, allowing anyone to potentially lock the funds.
2) Inconsistent state update: There might be a scenario where the state is set to Locked but the funds are not actually locked, leading to inconsistencies.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a transfer of funds using payee.transfer(amount) without checking the success status of the transfer, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state if the transfer fails.
4) Insufficient gas: The transfer of funds in the releaseFunds function might fail if there's not enough gas provided, leading to a failed fund release.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure unique addresses for payer, payee, and arbiter, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or confusion in the contract execution.
