The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership in the `admin` variable, allowing potential privilege escalation.
- insufficient gas in the `buyTokens` function, potentially leading to failed transactions.
- inconsistent state update in the `buyTokens` function, where the transfer of tokens and Ether is not done atomically, which could lead to issues.
- price manipulation in the `setTokenPrice` function, where the admin can change the token price without proper validation or restrictions.
