Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions or variables, which could lead to potential issues with access control.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables like 'proposal' and 'startingBalanceList' being updated in different functions, which could lead to inconsistent state changes.

3) Insufficient gas: The function 'endExecute' may require a significant amount of gas due to the check on the balance of the contract, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals or users, which could lead to conflicts or errors in the system.

5) Atomicity violation: The 'execute' function performs multiple state changes without being wrapped in a single atomic operation, which could lead to issues if some operations fail midway.

6) Privilege escalation: The 'startExecute' function allows any user to initiate a new proposal without proper authorization or validation checks, which could lead to privilege escalation attacks.

7) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have any mechanism to prevent self-destruct operations, which could lead to accidental or malicious destruction of the contract and its assets.

8) Ether leakage: There are no mechanisms in place to handle ether transactions securely, which could lead to potential ether leakage or loss.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, atomicity violation, privilege escalation, suicidal contracts, and ether leakage.
