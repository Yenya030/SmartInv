The contract provided for analysis:
contract Lottery {
     uint256 public totalTickets;
     address public winner;
     mapping(address => uint256) public tickets;

     function buyTickets(uint256 numTickets) public payable {
         require(msg.value >= numTickets * 0.1 ether, "Insufficient payment");
         totalTickets += numTickets;
         tickets[msg.sender] += numTickets;
     }

     function selectWinner() public {
         uint256 randomNumber = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % totalTickets + 1;
         address selectedWinner;
         uint256 count = 0;
         for (uint i = 1; i <= totalTickets; i++) {
             if (tickets[i] > 0) {
                 count += tickets[i];
                 if (count >= randomNumber) {
                     selectedWinner = addresses[i];
                     break;
                 }
             }
         }
         winner = selectedWinner;
     }
}
Output: 
- Business logic flaw: The function selectWinner doesn't ensure a fair selection of the winner.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables addresses[i] and totalTickets are not defined, which may lead to incorrect behavior.
