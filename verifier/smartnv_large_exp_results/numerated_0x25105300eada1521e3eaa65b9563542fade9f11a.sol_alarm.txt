The contract is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the proposal state without initializing it first, which can lead to inconsistent data and unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not be intended and could lead to ownership control vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
