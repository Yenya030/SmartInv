The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if it is already in progress, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Integer overflow: There is a lack of overflow checks when updating votedAmount in the execute function, which can lead to unexpected behavior due to integer overflow.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not explicitly defined as private or internal, which can lead to issues with ownership control.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure its security.
