SuTimeController contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The startExecute function allows any address to start a new proposal, potentially allowing unauthorized individuals to create proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential issue in the execute function where the votedAmount is updated without proper accounting for the total voted amount.
3) Atomicity violation: The execute function involves multiple state changes without appropriate atomicity measures, which could lead to inconsistent states.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a significant amount of gas due to the comparison of balances, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not explicitly defined whether certain functions should only be accessible by the contract owner, leading to potential ownership vulnerabilities.
