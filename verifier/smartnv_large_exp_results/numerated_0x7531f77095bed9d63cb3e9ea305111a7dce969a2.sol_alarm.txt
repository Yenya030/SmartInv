The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incrementally updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization of the state, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility: The `lockedFunds` variable is not properly defined in the contract, making it potentially accessible from outside the contract. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the `lockedFunds` variable.
