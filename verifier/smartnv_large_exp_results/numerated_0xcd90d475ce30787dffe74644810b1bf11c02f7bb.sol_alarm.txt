The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are as follows: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates as there are multiple state variables being modified in different functions without proper synchronization or checks for concurrent access. 

2) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of functions and variables is not specified, which can lead to unintended access or modification of contract state by external or unauthorized parties.  

3) Insufficient gas: There might be a risk of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, especially if they involve complex computations or interactions with other contracts.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is a possibility of ID clashes or lack of uniqueness in certain operations within the contract, leading to unexpected behavior or conflicts in data management. 

5) Arithmetic flaw: There could be potential arithmetic flaws in calculations involving tokens or balances, leading to incorrect results or unintended consequences in the contract's behavior.  

6) Ether leakage: The contract might have vulnerabilities related to managing Ether transfers or storage, potentially leading to funds being lost or improperly handled.
