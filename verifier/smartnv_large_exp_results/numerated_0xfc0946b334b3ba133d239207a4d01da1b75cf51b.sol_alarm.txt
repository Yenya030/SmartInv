The contract that needs to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    address public owner;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint amount) public {
        votes[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function withdrawVotes(address recipient, uint amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(votes[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough votes to withdraw");
        votes[msg.sender] -= amount;
        // Send tokens or do something with the votes
    }
}
```

This code snippet contains the potential vulnerabilities of ID uniqueness violation and incorrect visibility/ownership.
