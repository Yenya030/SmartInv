Contract:

contract Payment {
    uint public totalBalance;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        totalBalance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalBalance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The totalBalance is updated in the deposit() function, but not updated again when a user withdraws funds. This could lead to inconsistencies in the totalBalance variable.
2) Reentrancy: The withdraw function allows for reentrancy by calling an external contract before updating the user's balance. This could lead to potential vulnerabilities if the external contract exploit this design.
3) Ether leakage: If an external attacker calls the deposit function with a large value, the totalBalance may overflow, leading to ether leakage. Additionally, there is no check for overflow in the contract.
