The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if it is the first time or if there is an existing proposal already. This can lead to inconsistent state updates and potentially unintended behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may fail if the gas limit is reached while processing the `require` statement that checks if `execution failed`. This can result in the function not executing as expected.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables, leaving them as internal by default. This can lead to potential issues with ownership and access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
