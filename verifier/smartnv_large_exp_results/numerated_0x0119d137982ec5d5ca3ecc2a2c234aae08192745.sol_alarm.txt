The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is being updated without any synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent states.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function comprises multiple external calls (e.g., `votingToken.transferFrom`, `votedProposal(proposal)`), which are not wrapped in a single atomic operation, potentially allowing for issues if one call fails.

3) Insufficient gas: There is no gas stipend set for any external calls like `votingToken.transferFrom`, which might lead to out-of-gas exceptions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and insufficient gas.
