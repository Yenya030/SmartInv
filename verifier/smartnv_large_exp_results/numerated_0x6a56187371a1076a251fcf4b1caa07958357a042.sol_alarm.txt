The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Crowdsale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function invest() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Invalid investment amount");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}

output: 
reentrancy.
incorrect visibility/ownership.
