The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - owner variable is not declared in the shown contract, so the ownership mechanism is not clear.
2) Privilege escalation - there is no proper access control mechanism in place for opening and closing voting, allowing potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
3) Inconsistent state update - the state variable votingOpen can be changed by anyone without proper validation, leading to inconsistent state updates.
