The contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
     struct Voter {
          bool voted;
          address delegate;
          uint vote;
          uint weight;
      }
     struct Proposal {
          bytes32 name;
          uint voteCount;
      }
      
      address public chairperson;
      mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
      Proposal[] public proposals;

    function delegate(address to) public {
         Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
         require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");
         require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is disallowed.");
         
         while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
             to = voters[to].delegate;
         }
         
         sender.voted = true;
         sender.delegate = to;
         Voter storage delegate_ = voters[to];
         if (delegate_.voted) {
             proposals[delegate_.vote].voteCount += sender.weight;
         } else {
             delegate_.weight += sender.weight;
         }
     }
     
    function vote(uint proposal) public {
         Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
         require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");
         sender.voted = true;
         sender.vote = proposal;
         proposals[proposal].voteCount += sender.weight;
     }
     
    function winningProposal() public view returns (uint winningProposal_) {
         uint winningVoteCount = 0;
         for (uint p = 0; p < proposals.length; p++) {
             if (proposals[p].voteCount > winningVoteCount) {
                 winningVoteCount = proposals[p].voteCount;
                 winningProposal_ = p;
             }
         }
     }
} 

Output: 
- `inconsistent state update`: The `delegate` function allows changing the delegate recursively without properly updating the state, potentially leading to inconsistencies.
- `ID uniqueness violation`: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of voter addresses, which may lead to voting irregularities.
- `arithmetic flaw`: The `vote` function can potentially lead to arithmetic flaws when updating the vote count for a proposal, as it directly adds the voter's weight to the proposal's count without proper validation.
