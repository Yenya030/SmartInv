The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring that it is the correct calculation, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variable `owner` is declared as `internal` instead of `public` or `private`, which could lead to incorrect access control or visibility concerns.
