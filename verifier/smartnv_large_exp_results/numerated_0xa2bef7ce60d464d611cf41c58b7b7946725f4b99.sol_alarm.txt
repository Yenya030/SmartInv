This contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() initializes the proposal struct and the startingBlance variable but does not update the state variable proposal. This can lead to inconsistent data state.

2) Missing visibility: The functions votedProposal() and getStartingBalance() are not defined in the contract, which may be intended to be internal functions. Adding the appropriate visibility modifier can prevent unauthorized access.

3) Missing access control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute(). This can lead to unauthorized users calling these functions and manipulating the proposal data.

4) Integer Overflow/Underflow: The calculations in the function liquidate() involve multiplication and division, which may result in integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly. 

5) Incorrect external call: The function liquidate() makes external calls to USDC and WETH contracts without checking the return values. This can potentially lead to unexpected behaviors if the external calls fail. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Missing visibility
- Missing access control
- Integer Overflow/Underflow
- Incorrect external call
