Contract analysis output:
The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function based on a condition, but the logic for updating this variable is not clear and may lead to inconsistent state handling.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but the `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may lead to ownership issues or incorrect visibility of the variable.
