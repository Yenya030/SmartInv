Given the contract provided for analysis:

contract SwapTokens {
        IERC20 public tokenA;
        IERC20 public tokenB;
        uint public totalSupply;

        function swap(uint amount) public {
            require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "insufficient balance");
            tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
            totalSupply += amount;
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The totalSupply variable is increased without any check or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if not managed carefully.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The tokenA and tokenB variables are declared as public, which may expose sensitive information about these tokens to external parties.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract SwapTokens are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
