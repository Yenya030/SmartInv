Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state of the proposal struct without checking for an existing proposal, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if the amount of gas provided is not enough to complete the required operations, risking the execution failed scenario.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal visibility of the owner variable may lead to a lack of access control and potential privilege escalation if not handled properly.
