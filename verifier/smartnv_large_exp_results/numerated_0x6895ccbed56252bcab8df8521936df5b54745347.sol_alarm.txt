The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the functions in the contract is not explicitly specified. 
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates within functions without proper checking or validation.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas consumption appropriately, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
4) Potential reentrancy vulnerability: The functions interact with external contracts without using proper checks to prevent reentrancy attacks.
