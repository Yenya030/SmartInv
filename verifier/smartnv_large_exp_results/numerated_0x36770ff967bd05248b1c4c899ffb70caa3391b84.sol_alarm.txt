The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistency state update: 
- In the `startExecute` function, the `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` is being updated without proper validation, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which might cause issues related to incorrect visibility levels or ownership control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistency state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
