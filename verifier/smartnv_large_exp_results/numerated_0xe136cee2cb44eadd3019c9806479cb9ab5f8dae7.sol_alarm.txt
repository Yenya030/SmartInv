contract TokenSwap {

    function swap(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
        require(token1.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount1, "Insufficient balance of token1");
        require(token2.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount2, "Insufficient balance of token2");

}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: There might be a risk of inconsistent state update if the transfers fail after the balance check, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow/underflow when handling the token amounts during the swap process.
3) Insufficient gas: If the token transfers require more gas than available, the swap function may fail, leading to insufficient gas vulnerability.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the token1 and token2 variables might expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to security risks.
