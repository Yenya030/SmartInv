The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update - There is a possibility of inconsistent state update in the function endExecute(), where the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` may not accurately capture the execution status due to potential updates in the blockchain state during the function's execution.

2) Atomicity violation - The function execute() lacks proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to atomicity violations if multiple executions interfere with each other.

3) Integer overflow/underflow - The use of arithmetic operations in various parts of the contract may lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities, especially in cases where the values reach their limits.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, leading to potential vulnerabilities related to unauthorized access or control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
