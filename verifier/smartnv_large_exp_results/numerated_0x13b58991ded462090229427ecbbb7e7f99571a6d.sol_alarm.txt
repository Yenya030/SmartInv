The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) inconsistent state update: The update of proposal.votedAmount and the call to votedProposal() should be performed atomically to prevent inconsistent state updates.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility modifiers for some functions, which may result in incorrect access control and ownership issues.
