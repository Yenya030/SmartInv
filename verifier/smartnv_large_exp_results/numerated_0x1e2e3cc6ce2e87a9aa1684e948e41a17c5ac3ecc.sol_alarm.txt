The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: In the function `startExecute`, when setting the starting balance for a proposal, the variable `startingBalanceList` is updated based on the initial value of `proposal.addr`. However, it seems that `proposal.addr` might be changed later, leading to a potential inconsistency in the stored starting balance.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20`, but it doesn't fully define all the required functions specified by the interface. This could lead to issues with contract interoperability.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` checks a condition that involves a potentially expensive operation, the calculation of `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2`. This could lead to running out of gas during the execution of the function.
4) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include a self-destruct mechanism, but it's worth noting that intentionally allowing the contract to self-destruct can be considered a vulnerability depending on the scenario.
