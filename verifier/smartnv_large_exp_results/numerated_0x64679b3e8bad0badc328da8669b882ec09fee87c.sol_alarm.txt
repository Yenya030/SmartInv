Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control measures to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent contract state.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations being performed without proper bounds checking, making the contract vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Visibility of functions and variables is not specified, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation by external parties.
5) Insufficient gas: The contract functions may require more gas than is provided, leading to execution failures or incomplete operations.
