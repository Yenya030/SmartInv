Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions release and refund allow anyone to call them, not just the intended buyer or seller, potentially leading to unauthorized fund transfers.
- Inconsistent state update: The deposit function does not update any state variables related to the deposited amount, which may lead to inconsistencies in tracking the deposited funds.
