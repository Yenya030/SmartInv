Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Insufficient gas: The contract does not provide enough gas for certain operations, which can lead to failures or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables in the contract may not be appropriately defined, leading to potential security risks.
