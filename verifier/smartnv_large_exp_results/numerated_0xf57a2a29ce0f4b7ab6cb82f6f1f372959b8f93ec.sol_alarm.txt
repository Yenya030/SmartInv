The contract provided for analysis:

contract Governor {
    address public governor;
    uint public totalVotes;

    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    function vote(address proposal, uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(amount <= votes[msg.sender], "Not enough votes");
        
        votes[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalVotes -= amount;
        
        // Logic for voting on the proposal
        // ...
        
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
    
    function changeGovernor(address newGovernor) public {
        require(msg.sender == governor, "Not authorized");
        governor = newGovernor;
    }
}

- Privilege Escalation
