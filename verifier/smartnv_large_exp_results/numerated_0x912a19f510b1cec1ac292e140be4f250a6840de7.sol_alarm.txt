The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votedProposal` function, which can lead to potential security issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no explicit check to prevent multiple executions of the same proposal, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does multiple operations without using any form of atomicity, which can lead to unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails midway.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially gas-intensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`), which could result in insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.
5) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function has a condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` that could potentially lead to incorrect execution outcomes depending on the total supply and balances of the tokens involved.
