The contract provided:

contract SaleContract {
    uint public price;
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    
    function setPrice(uint _price) public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can set the price");
        price = _price;
    }
    
    function buy() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can buy");
        require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient funds");
        seller.transfer(msg.value);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: Lack of proper access control mechanisms can lead to unauthorized parties gaining control over critical functions and data of the contract. 
2) inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state updates due to the lack of proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
