This contract could have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` without properly checking or updating the state of the proposal. This could lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility or ownership modifiers for the `votingToken` variable, which could lead to potential security issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` checks the balance of the contract before performing any actions, which may consume excessive gas and result in a potential vulnerability.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
