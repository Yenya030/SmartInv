Potential vulnerabilities in the contract at the end:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount of the proposal without ensuring that the required conditions are met, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not explicitly stated as public or private, potentially leading to issues with visibility and ownership control.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require excessive gas to execute if the totalSupply() function result is too large, leading to potential out of gas issues.
