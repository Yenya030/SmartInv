The contract for analysis is:

contract TokenSale {
     address public admin;
     IERC20 public token;
     uint public tokenPrice;
     uint public totalTokens;
     uint public tokensSold;
     
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;
     
     constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) {
         admin = msg.sender;
         token = _token;
         tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
         totalTokens = _totalTokens;
     }
     
     function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public {
         require(tokensSold + _numTokens <= totalTokens, "Not enough tokens available");
         uint cost = _numTokens * tokenPrice;
         require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cost, "Insufficient balance");
         
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, admin, cost);
         balances[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
         tokensSold += _numTokens;
     }
}
The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
- Insufficient gas: In functions that involve token transfers, insufficient gas may lead to the transaction failing midway, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: If certain functions or variables are meant to be restricted to the admin or specific users, improper visibility or ownership validation can lead to unauthorized access to critical functionalities.
- Business logic flaw: There may be potential flaws in the token sale logic that could lead to unexpected behavior or exploitation by malicious actors.
