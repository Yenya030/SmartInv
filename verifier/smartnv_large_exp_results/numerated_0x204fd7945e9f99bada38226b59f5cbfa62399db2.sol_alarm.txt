The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` modifies the state of the `proposal` struct without checking if it has already been initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `votingToken` variable, which can potentially lead to issues with visibility and ownership control.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a loop over all users, potentially leading to running out of gas if the number of users is large.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
