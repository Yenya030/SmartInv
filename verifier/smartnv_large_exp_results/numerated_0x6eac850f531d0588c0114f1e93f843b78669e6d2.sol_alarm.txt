The contract to analyze:
contract VotingSystem {
     address[] public voters;

     function addVoter(address _voter) public {
          voters.push(_voter);
     }

     function removeVoter(address _voter) public {
          for (uint i = 0; i < voters.length; i++) {
               if (voters[i] == _voter) {
                    delete voters[i];
               }
          }
     }

     function getVotersCount() public view returns (uint) {
          return voters.length;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The removal of a voter by setting the address to zero with `delete voters[i];` may not remove the address correctly, leading to an inconsistent state.
2) ID uniqueness violation: If the voters array allows duplicate entries, it may lead to ID uniqueness violation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Depending on the intended functionality, the visibility of the voters array may not be secure, or the ownership control could be a vulnerability.
