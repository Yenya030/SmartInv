Potential vulnerabilities:
7) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique identifiers for users voting, which may lead to voting manipulation.
13) Insufficient gas: Redemption logic may require more gas than available in a single transaction, causing it to fail.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The function redeemVotes can be misused if visibility modifiers are not correctly set or if ownership is not properly managed.
