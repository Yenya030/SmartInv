Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to enforce unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to potential issues with duplicate proposals or conflicting data.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain functions and variables such as `owner`, `votingToken`, and `startingBalanceList` is not specified, leaving them potentially accessible by external entities. Adding appropriate visibility modifiers can help in securing the contract.

Overall, the contract may be susceptible to ID uniqueness violation and incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerabilities.
