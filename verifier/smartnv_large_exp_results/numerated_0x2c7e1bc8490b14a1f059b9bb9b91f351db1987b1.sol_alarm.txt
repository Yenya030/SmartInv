The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is being called without being declared within the contract, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

2) inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the transfer of tokens was successful or not, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if the transfer fails.

3) atomicity violation: The `execute` function updates `proposal.votedAmount` and calls `votedProposal(proposal)` separately, which can lead to atomicity violation if one of the operations fails after the other has already been executed.

4) insufficient gas: If the `endExecute` function encounters a situation where the gas cost exceeds the gas limit, it may not be able to complete the execution, leading to insufficient gas vulnerability.
