The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without resetting the `proposal` state, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: If the `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract requires a large amount of gas to execute, it can potentially run out of gas and fail to complete, leading to insufficient gas vulnerability.
