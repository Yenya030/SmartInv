Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculatePrice() function if the balances of USDC and WETH become very large, as the division result may exceed the maximum uint value.

2) Inconsistent state update: There might be an issue with inconsistent state updates in the liquidate function, where the debt and collateral mappings are updated without proper synchronization or validation.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the debt and collateral mappings is public, which might expose sensitive information about user debt and collateral to unauthorized parties. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Integer overflow/underflow, Inconsistent state update, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
