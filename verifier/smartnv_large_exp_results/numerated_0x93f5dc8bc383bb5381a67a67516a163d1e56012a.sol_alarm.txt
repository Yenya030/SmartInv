The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: There could be inconsistency in updating the state of contributions as it only tracks the amount contributed but does not handle deductions or refunds.
2) Insufficient gas: If the contribution amount is large, transferring the amount to the owner using payable may encounter "out of gas" issues.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties.
