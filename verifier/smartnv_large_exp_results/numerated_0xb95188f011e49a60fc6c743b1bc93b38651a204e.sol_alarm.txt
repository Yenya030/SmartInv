The potential vulnerabilities in the contract Auction are:
- Reentrancy: The transfer function is called before updating the highestBidder and highestBid values, which could allow a malicious bidder to call a fallback function in the highestBidder contract before the values are updated, leading to reentrancy attack.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is no protection against overflow or underflow when updating the highestBid value, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the value exceeds the maximum uint size.
