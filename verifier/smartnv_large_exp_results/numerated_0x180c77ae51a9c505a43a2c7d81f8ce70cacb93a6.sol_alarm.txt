The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The `proposal` variable is updated in the `startExecute()` function without checking if there is an existing proposal in progress. This can lead to inconsistent state if multiple proposals are started simultaneously.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The `owner` variable is declared with internal visibility, which might restrict access to certain functions that require owner level access.

3) Insufficient gas: 
   - The `endExecute()` function performs a gas-heavy operation (`require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) which can potentially lead to out-of-gas exceptions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
