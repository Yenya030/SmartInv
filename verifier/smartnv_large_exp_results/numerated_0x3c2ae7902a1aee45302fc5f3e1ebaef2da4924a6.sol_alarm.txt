The contract under analysis contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or errors when processing multiple proposals simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables owner, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds is not specified, potentially exposing them to unintended access or modification.
3) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal and related variables is updated in startExecute() and execute() functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a high gas limit to execute due to the loop over all votingToken balances, which could result in out-of-gas errors.
5) Business logic flaw: The condition in the endExecute() function (require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()) may not accurately validate the execution conditions, potentially allowing for improper fund unlocking.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Business logic flaw
