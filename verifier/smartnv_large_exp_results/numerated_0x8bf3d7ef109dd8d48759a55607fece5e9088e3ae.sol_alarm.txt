Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail to execute if it requires a large amount of gas due to transferring tokens and checking balances.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear who has ownership over the contract as the owner variable is defined but not used or assigned in the contract.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
