Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings but does not validate if the necessary conditions are met before updating them. This could lead to inconsistent or incorrect state updates.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs arithmetic operations (division) without proper validation for potential division by zero or overflow/underflow.

3) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract relies on external state variables (balanceOf) which can be manipulated to influence the price calculation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: Inconsistent state update, Arithmetic flaw, and Price manipulation.
