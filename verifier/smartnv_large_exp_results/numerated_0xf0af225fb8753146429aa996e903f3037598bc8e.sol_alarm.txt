Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract. However, it does not reset the `proposal` struct or any other relevant variables, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not marked as `internal` or `private`, making it publicly accessible and potentially allowing unauthorized parties to manipulate the locked funds. Consider marking it with a more restrictive visibility modifier.
