The contract has the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without considering the possibility of reentrancy or multiple executions happening at the same time, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as private, making its data publicly accessible and potentially modifiable by external actors.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a loop over `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, which can potentially run out of gas if the contract holds a large number of tokens.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow/underflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` inside the `liquidate` function if the values involved are large enough.
5) Insufficient validation: The `endExecute` function should perform additional validation to ensure that the `proposal` data is correctly initialized and updated before proceeding with actions based on that data.
