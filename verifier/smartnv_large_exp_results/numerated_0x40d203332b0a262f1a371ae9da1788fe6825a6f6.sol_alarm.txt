The contract I am going to analyze is:

contract PaymentProcessor {
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     function deposit() public payable {
         balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }
    
     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- integer overflow/underflow: The balances are stored as uint, which could potentially lead to overflow if the balance reaches the maximum uint value.
- insufficient gas: If a user tries to withdraw a large amount that depletes their balance, the transfer of funds may fail due to insufficient gas.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, which exposes all user balances to the public, violating privacy and potentially leading to security concerns.
