The contract provided for analysis:
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;
    
    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }
    
    function resetVotes() public {
        require(totalVotes > 0, "No votes to reset");
        totalVotes = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
            hasVoted[msg.sender] = false;
        }
    }
}
