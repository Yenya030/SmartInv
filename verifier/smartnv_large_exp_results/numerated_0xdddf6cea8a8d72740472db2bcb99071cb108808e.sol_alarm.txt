Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent data.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a potentially costly operation of checking if the locked funds exceed a certain threshold without ensuring that enough gas is provided for this operation.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for ensuring proper access control.
