The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    address public admin;
    IERC20 public token;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    constructor(address _token) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        token = IERC20(_token);
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        uint cost = _amount * getPrice();
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        balances[msg.sender] += cost;
    }

    function getPrice() public returns(uint) {
        // pricing logic implementation
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

- Business logic flaw: The `getPrice` function is not implemented in the contract, which indicates a potential business logic flaw.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is public, potentially exposing ownership details.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw and incorrect visibility/ownership.
