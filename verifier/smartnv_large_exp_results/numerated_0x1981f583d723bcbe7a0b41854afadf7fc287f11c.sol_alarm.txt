potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) atomicity violation: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute seem to be separate parts of a process that should ideally be executed atomically to prevent inconsistent states or vulnerabilities.

2) inconsistent state update: The use of the proposal struct for tracking ongoing proposals and its manipulation in multiple functions may result in inconsistent state updates if not carefully managed.

3) integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations like adding voted amounts or calculating balances that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not properly checked and handled.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership control and visibility of certain variables and functions may not be clearly defined, leading to potential vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.

5) ether leakage: The contract seems to deal with ERC20 tokens, but the presence of Ether transfer functions like transferFrom may lead to potential ether leakage if not handled properly.

6) insufficient gas: The functions in the contract may require a significant amount of gas to execute, and if not enough gas is provided by the caller, it could lead to failed executions or vulnerabilities.

7) ID uniqueness violation: The use of addresses as identifiers in mappings may lead to potential ID uniqueness violations if not verified or handled properly.

8) business logic flaw: The overall flow and logic of the contract should be carefully reviewed to ensure that there are no logical vulnerabilities or flaws that could be exploited by malicious parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, incorrect visibility/ownership, ether leakage, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, and business logic flaw.
