Given the provided code snippet, potential vulnerabilities in the contract include:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" variable is updated directly in the "execute" function without any checks or validation, which could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the necessary functions for ERC20 token functionalities such as transfer, approve, or balanceOf. This could lead to ownership issues and lack of visibility for external interactions.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
