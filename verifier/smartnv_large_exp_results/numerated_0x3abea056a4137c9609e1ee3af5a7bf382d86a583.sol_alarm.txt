The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract are:

1) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation of `cost` in the `swap` function could potentially result in an arithmetic overflow or underflow if the `amount` and `exchangeRate` are not properly validated.
   
2) Insufficient gas: If the gas cost of the `transfer` functions exceeds the gas limit set for the `swap` function, the transaction may fail and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Depending on the intended functionality, the visibility (public, internal, private) of the functions and variables within the contract may not be appropriate, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of contract functionalities.
