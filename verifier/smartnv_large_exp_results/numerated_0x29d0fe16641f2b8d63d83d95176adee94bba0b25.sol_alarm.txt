Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the intended visibility or ownership control.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of functions that involve token transfers, leading to incomplete transactions.
4) Atomicity violation: The `votedProposal` function might not be atomic, which can result in partial execution and inconsistent state updates.
