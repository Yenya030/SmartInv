Contract you are going to analyze:

contract Lottery {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public playerTickets;
    address[] public players;
    uint public ticketPrice = 0.1 ether;
  
    function buyTickets(uint numberOfTickets) public payable {
        require(msg.value >= ticketPrice * numberOfTickets, "Insufficient funds");
        for (uint i = 0; i < numberOfTickets; i++) {
            players.push(msg.sender);
            playerTickets[msg.sender]++;
        }
    }
  
    function pickWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can pick winner");
        uint winningTicket = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winningTicket];
        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
