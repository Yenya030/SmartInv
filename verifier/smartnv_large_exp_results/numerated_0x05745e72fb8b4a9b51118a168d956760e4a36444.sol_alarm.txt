The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function execute updates the proposal's votedAmount without properly handling potential race conditions or ensuring atomicity.

2) Insufficient gas: 
   - The endExecute function could potentially run out of gas if the operation of checking the execution condition and calculating lockedFunds exceeds the gas limit.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The variable proposal is not marked as public or internal, potentially allowing external manipulation.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
