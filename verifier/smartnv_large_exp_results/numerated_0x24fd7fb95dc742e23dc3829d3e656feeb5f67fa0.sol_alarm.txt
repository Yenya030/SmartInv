The contract to analyze:

contract CycledLoan {
    struct Loan {
        address borrower;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 duration;
        uint256 interestRate;
        uint256 startTime;
        bool isActive;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Loan) public loans;
    uint256 public loanCounter;

    function requestLoan(uint256 _amount, uint256 _duration, uint256 _interestRate) public {
        loans[loanCounter] = Loan(msg.sender, _amount, _duration, _interestRate, block.timestamp, true);
        loanCounter++;
    }

    function repayLoan(uint256 _loanId) public {
        require(loans[_loanId].isActive, "Loan is not active");
        require(msg.sender == loans[_loanId].borrower, "Only borrower can repay the loan");
        
        uint256 totalAmount = loans[_loanId].amount + (loans[_loanId].amount * loans[_loanId].interestRate / 100);
        require(msg.value >= totalAmount, "Insufficient funds"); 

        loans[_loanId].isActive = false;
    }
}

Output:
1) arithmetic flaw
2) inconsistent state update
