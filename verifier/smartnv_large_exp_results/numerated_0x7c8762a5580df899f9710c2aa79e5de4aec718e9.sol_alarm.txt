Contract TimelockController is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct directly, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, which can lead to potential issues with ownership control.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a large amount of gas if the votingToken balance is very high, potentially leading to out of gas errors.

Overall, the contract could be improved to address these vulnerabilities.
