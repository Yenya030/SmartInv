Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Arithmetic flaw in the function calculatePrice() where division might result in an integer underflow if either USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) or WETH.balanceOf(address(pair)) is lower than the other.
2) Insufficient gas in the liquidate function, as it involves transferring tokens which might require more gas than the default gas limit.
3) Incorrect visibility in the debt and collateral mappings, as they are public and can potentially expose sensitive information.
4) ID uniqueness violation if there is no mechanism in place to ensure unique user addresses in the liquidate function.
