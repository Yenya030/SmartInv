The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        bool voted;
        uint256 vote;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    
    function vote(uint256 _proposalId) public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted.");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = _proposalId;
        
        totalVotes++;
    }
    
    function getWinner() public view returns (uint256) {
        // Logic to determine the winner proposal
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for ensuring the uniqueness of the proposal ID when a user votes. It could lead to duplicate votes for the same proposal.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `totalVotes` variable is incremented without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which may lead to race conditions and inconsistent state.
3) Business logic flaw: The `getWinner` function lacks implementation for determining the winner proposal, leaving the contract vulnerable to manipulation of the winning result.
