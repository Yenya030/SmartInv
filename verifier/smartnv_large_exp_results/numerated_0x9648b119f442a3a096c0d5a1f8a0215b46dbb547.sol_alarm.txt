The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of the functions in the contract is not specified. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the visibility is not appropriately set.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract's state variables are not updated consistently in all functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: There may be functions in the contract that require more gas than the standard gas limit, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, which can result in ether leakage and potential vulnerabilities.
