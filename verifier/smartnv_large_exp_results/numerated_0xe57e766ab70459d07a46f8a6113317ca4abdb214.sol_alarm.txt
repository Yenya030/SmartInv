The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` variable in the `execute` function is updated directly without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `execute` and `endExecute` functions are marked as `external`, which might not be the intended visibility for these functions.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle or account for potential gas limitations in certain operations, which might lead to transactions failing due to running out of gas.
