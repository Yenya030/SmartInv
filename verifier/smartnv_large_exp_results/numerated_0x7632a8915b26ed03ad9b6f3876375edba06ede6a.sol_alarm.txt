Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any explicit access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only specific users or roles, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute critical functions.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` of the proposal is directly incremented without using proper synchronization methods. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal concurrently.

3) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not bundled within a single atomic transaction, making it possible for the state of the contract to be left in an unexpected state if an operation fails in the middle.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the data structures like `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, potentially exposing sensitive information to external contracts.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving integer arithmetic, such as addition in the `execute` function, that do not have proper overflow/underflow protection, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the values exceed the maximum or minimum limits of the data type.

6) Insufficient gas: The contract does not account for the gas limit in transactions, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors or failed transactions if the operations require more gas than available.

7) Ether leakage: The contract does not have mechanisms to handle unexpected Ether transfers, which could result in Ether leakage and loss of funds if Ether is sent to the contract unintentionally.

8) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not prevent self-destruct calls, allowing the contract to be destroyed and all associated funds to be lost if a malicious user triggers the self-destruct function.
