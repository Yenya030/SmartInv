Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Price manipulation: The price of tokens is set by the seller, which can potentially be manipulated to overcharge buyers.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "seller" address is public, which can expose sensitive information about the seller's identity or ownership.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculation of cost in the buyTokens function if the amount is very large.
4) Insufficient gas: If the contract balance runs low on gas, it may not be able to execute transactions properly, leading to unexpected behavior or failures.
