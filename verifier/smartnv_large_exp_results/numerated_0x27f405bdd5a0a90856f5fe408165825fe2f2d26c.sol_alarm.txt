Contract in Evaluation:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight; 
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
    }

    struct Proposal {
        uint256 voteCount;
    }

    address public chairperson;
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    Proposal[] public proposals;

    constructor() {
        chairperson = msg.sender;
        voters[chairperson].weight = 1;
    }

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation.");
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
        Voter storage delegate_ = voters[to];
        if (delegate_.voted) {
            proposals[delegate_.voteCount].voteCount += sender.weight;
        } else {
            delegate_.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint256 proposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "Already voted.");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.voteCount = proposal;
        proposals[proposal].voteCount += sender.weight;
    }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities of the Contract:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
