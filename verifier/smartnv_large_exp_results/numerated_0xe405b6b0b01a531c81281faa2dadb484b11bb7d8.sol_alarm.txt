Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - the contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the functions and variables, which could lead to unintended access or misuse.
2) inconsistent state update - the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly without proper checks or validations, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state.
3) atomicity violation - multiple state changes occur within each function without using a mechanism to ensure atomicity, which could result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
4) insufficient gas - certain functions may require more gas than available due to complex operations or interactions, potentially causing them to fail or leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
