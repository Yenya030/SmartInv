The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no check to ensure that this update is done atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is used internally within the contract without any access control or visibility specifier, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
