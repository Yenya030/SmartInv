The contract I am going to analyze:

contract SmartContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance = 0;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner");
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Output: 
- Inconsistent state update: The balance variable can be modified independently of the deposit or withdraw functions, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which can expose sensitive information about the contract's ownership.
- Privilege escalation: The transferOwnership function allows the current owner to transfer ownership to any address without proper authorization.
- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle failed transfers in the withdraw function, which can lead to ether leakage if the transfer fails.
