The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `startingBalanceList` variable, which can potentially lead to data leakage or manipulation by external contracts.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without atomicity checks, leading to potential inconsistent state updates if multiple calls are made concurrently.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas provided is not enough to execute the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not include a unique identifier for each proposal, which can lead to issues with identifying and processing multiple proposals accurately.
