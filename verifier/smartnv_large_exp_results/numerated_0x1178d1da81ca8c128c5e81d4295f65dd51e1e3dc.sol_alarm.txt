Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute` function is being updated without any proper checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, such as `transfer`. This could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations performed without proper checks for potential integer overflow or underflow, such as in the calculation of `startingBalance` in the `startExecute` function.

4) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions due to multiple external calls and computations performed within a single function, potentially leading to insufficient gas issues.
