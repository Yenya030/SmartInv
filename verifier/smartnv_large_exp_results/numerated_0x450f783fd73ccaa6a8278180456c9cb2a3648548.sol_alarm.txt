Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
2) Business logic flaw: 
   - The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract could potentially have a business logic flaw as the condition for liquidation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount) may not accurately reflect the actual liquidation requirements.
8) Reentrancy:
   - The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract transfers tokens before updating the debt and collateral mappings, which could open up the contract to reentrancy attacks.
