The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `votedProposal(proposal)` is called in the `execute` function without provided implementation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBlance` variable in the `startExecute` function is not defined and could potentially lead to issues with incorrect visibility or ownership.
