The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Wallet {
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     function deposit() public payable {
         balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow in the deposit function
2) Insufficient gas in the withdraw function

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Insufficient gas
