The contract provided is:

```
contract Mortgage {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public mortgageAmounts;

    constructor(address _token) public {
        token = IERC20(_token);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function takeMortgage(uint amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Not enough tokens");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        mortgageAmounts[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function payOffMortgage() public {
        uint amount = mortgageAmounts[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No mortgage to pay off");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        mortgageAmounts[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

Output: 

- `incorrect visibility/ownership`: The owner variable should be declared as private since it is not meant to be accessed or modified outside of the contract. 
- `insufficient gas`: The functions takeMortgage and payOffMortgage may require a significant amount of gas for execution, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
- `inconsistent state update`: The payOffMortgage function may have inconsistent state updates if multiple calls are made within the same block.
- `integer overflow/underflow`: There is a potential integer underflow issue in the payOffMortgage function if an attacker attempts to pay off a negative mortgage amount.
- `ether leakage`: The contract does not handle Ether transactions explicitly, which may lead to unintended Ether transfers.
