The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function in the TimelockController contract might have a business logic flaw as it directly calculates the success of execution based on the comparison of the balance of the contract with twice the total supply of the voting token. This may not be a correct measure of successful execution.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract does not specify the visibility of the proposal struct, which could potentially lead to unintended access or manipulation of proposal data.

3) Inconsistent state update: The endExecute function in the TimelockController contract updates the lockedFunds variable without resetting the proposal state variables, potentially leading to inconsistent states within the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, incorrect visibility/ownership, and inconsistent state update.
