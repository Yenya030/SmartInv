The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state updates in the `endExecute` function where the `lockedFunds` variable is being updated based on the balance of the contract, which might not accurately represent the actual locked funds.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which can lead to unexpected external access or manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: The execution of certain functions, especially the `endExecute` function, might require significant gas costs due to potentially high computations, which can lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
