Contract to analyze:

contract Auction {
     address public highestBidder;
     address public owner;
     uint public highestBid;

     function bid(uint amount) public {
          require(amount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
          
          if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
               highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
          }
          
          highestBidder = msg.sender;
          highestBid = amount;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
          require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can withdraw");
          
          highestBidder = address(0);
          highestBid = 0;
     }
}

Output: 
1) reentrancy
2) inconsistent state update
