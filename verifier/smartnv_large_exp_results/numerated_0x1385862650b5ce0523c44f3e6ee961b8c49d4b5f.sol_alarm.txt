The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
3) business logic flaw: The transfer function should also check for potential integer overflows when increasing or decreasing token amounts.
8) reentrancy: The contract does not include reentrancy protection which can lead to malicious contracts exploiting this vulnerability to perform multiple operations through a single transaction.
