The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract PaymentGateway {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint => bool) public paymentStatus;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function makePayment(uint paymentId) external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Payment amount must be greater than 0");
        
        paymentStatus[paymentId] = true;
    }
    
    function withdrawFunds() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
    
    function updatePaymentStatus(uint paymentId, bool status) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update payment status");
        
        paymentStatus[paymentId] = status;
    }
}
