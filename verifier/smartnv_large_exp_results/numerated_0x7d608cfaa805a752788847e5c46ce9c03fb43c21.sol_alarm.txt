The contract available for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public escrowBalance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can deposit funds");
        escrowBalance += msg.value;
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can release funds");
        address(uint160(seller)).transfer(escrowBalance);
        escrowBalance = 0;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can refund funds");
        address(uint160(buyer)).transfer(escrowBalance);
        escrowBalance = 0;
    }
}
```

Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `deposit`, `release`, and `refund` functions should have specific ownership requirements for execution, but they currently only check the `msg.sender`. This may lead to unauthorized access to these critical operations.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `escrowBalance` is directly incremented in the `deposit` function without properly considering potential overflow/underflow issues or ensuring consistency with the transfer operations in the `release` and `refund` functions.
3) Reentrancy: The transfer of funds to `seller` or `buyer` in the `release` and `refund` functions respectively could potentially trigger reentrancy attacks if the receiving address contains malicious fallback functions.
