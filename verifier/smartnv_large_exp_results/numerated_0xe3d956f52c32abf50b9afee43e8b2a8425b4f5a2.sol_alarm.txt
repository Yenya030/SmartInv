Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract's state is modified in functions like `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` without proper synchronization or validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior or state inconsistencies. 

2) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of operations like `execute` or `endExecute`, especially if the contract is dealing with a large number of tokens or users, leading to incomplete transactions or failed execution.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions are not clearly defined, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical contract functionalities.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract involves transferring tokens between different addresses (`proposal.addr`, `address(this)`) without proper checks or validation, which could result in incorrect token transfers, loss of funds, or inconsistencies in token balances.
