The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct directly, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it at the same time.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute` function does not specify the visibility of `proposal`, `startingBlance`, and `startingBalanceList`, which can lead to potential issues with contract ownership and visibility.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function calculates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract address, which might require significant gas costs depending on the size of the balance.

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
