The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables "lockedFunds" and "startingBalanceList" is not specified, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the "execute" function, the variable "proposal.votedAmount" is incremented without proper synchronization or concurrency control, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function performs a check that involves calculating the balance of tokens held by the contract, which may consume excessive gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

4) Privilege escalation: The "startExecute" function initializes the "proposal" struct with the caller's address, which can lead to privilege escalation if the caller is not the intended owner or privileged entity.
