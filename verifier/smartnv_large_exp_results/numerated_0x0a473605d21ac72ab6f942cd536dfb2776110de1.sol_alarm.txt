Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `startingBalanceList` variables are not specified with any visibility modifier, making them publicly accessible.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but the `votedProposal` function is not defined, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of insufficient gas provided for the execution of functions that involve token transfers, which could result in the transaction failing.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not contain any unique identifier for each proposal, which may lead to conflicts or unintended behavior if multiple proposals are active at the same time.
