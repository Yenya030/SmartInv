The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' is being updated in the 'endExecute' function without considering the case where the balance in the contract might change before the check is performed.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not contain the required functions to comply with the interface, which could lead to issues related to incorrect visibility or ownership of functions.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
