Contract to analyze:

contract PaymentGateway {
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     function deposit() public payable {
         balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Insufficient gas, as the withdrawal function relies on the sender to have enough gas to cover the transfer amount.
- Integer overflow/underflow, as the balances are stored as uint and no check is in place to prevent overflow or underflow.
- Ether leakage, as there is potential for ether to get stuck in the contract if a sender doesn't have enough gas to complete the transfer.
