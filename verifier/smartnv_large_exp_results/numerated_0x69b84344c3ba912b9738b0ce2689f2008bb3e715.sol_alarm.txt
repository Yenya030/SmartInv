The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` does not reset the `proposal` variables after execution, potentially causing unexpected behavior in future executions.

2) Business logic flaw: The requirement `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function may have a business logic flaw by comparing the balance of the contract with twice the total supply of the token.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of the `execute` function if the gas required for the transaction exceeds the gas limit.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable seems to be accessed externally in the `endExecute` function but is not defined in the contract, indicating an incorrect visibility or ownership issue. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are inconsistent state update, business logic flaw, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
