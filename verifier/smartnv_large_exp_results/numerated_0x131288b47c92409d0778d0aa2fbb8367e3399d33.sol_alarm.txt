The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes unexpectedly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is used in the contract, but it is not defined in the code snippet provided. Depending on the visibility and ownership of the IERC20 interface, this could lead to potential vulnerabilities.
