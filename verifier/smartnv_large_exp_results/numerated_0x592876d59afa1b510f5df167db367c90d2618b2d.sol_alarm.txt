The contract you provided for analysis is as follows:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        address addr;
        uint256 voteCount;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    
    function vote() public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].voteCount == 0, "Already voted");
        voters[msg.sender].voteCount++;
        totalVotes++;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of voter addresses, which could lead to issues with multiple votes from the same address.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle updating the state of the voter and totalVotes atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `voters` mapping and `totalVotes` variable are set to public, which exposes sensitive data publicly and may not adhere to good security practices.
