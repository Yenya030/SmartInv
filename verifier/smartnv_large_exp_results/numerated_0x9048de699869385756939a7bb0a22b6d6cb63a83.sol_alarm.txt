Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle updating the state of the proposal consistently, leading to potential issues with the execution of proposals.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility/ownership of certain functions and variables is not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
