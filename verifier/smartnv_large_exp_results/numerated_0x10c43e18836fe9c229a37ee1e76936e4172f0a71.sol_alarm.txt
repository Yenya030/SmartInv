The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 
1) integer overflow/underflow: The calculations involving 'debt[user]' and 'collateral[user]' in the liquidate function may lead to integer underflow if the values are not properly validated.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the 'calculatePrice' function is public, but it is related to internal calculations that should not be exposed externally. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow and incorrect visibility/ownership.
