Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Atomicity violation: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute modify the state of the contract without using proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity.
2) Inconsistent state update: The variable proposal.votedAmount is directly modified in the execute function without proper validation and verification.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the IERC20 interface but does not provide the required functions.
