Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but is missing the necessary functions for an ERC20 token contract, such as transfer and transferFrom. 
- Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal's votedAmount without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state.
- Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a gas-intensive operation (checking balanceOf for all votingToken holders) that may exceed the gas limit and cause the function to fail midway.
- Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the lockedFunds is greater than half of the total supply of votingToken to determine execution success, which may not accurately reflect the intended business logic.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
