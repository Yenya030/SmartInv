Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `startingBalanceList` without initialization, which can lead to inconsistencies in the state.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve tokens and amounts, which may result in integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList`, which can lead to potential issues related to access control and ownership.
4) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs multiple operations that involve token transfers and balance checks, which may require a significant amount of gas to execute, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
