In the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains functions (startExecute, execute, endExecute) that manipulate the state of the proposal struct without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no explicit check for integer overflow/underflow in the functions execute and endExecute, which may result in unexpected behavior if the calculation exceeds the limits of uint256.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not properly define the visibility of the interface functions, which can lead to issues related to visibility and ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent state update, Integer overflow/underflow, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
