Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state of `proposal` without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not properly defined in the contract, making it unclear who has ownership or visibility over this variable.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may fail if there is insufficient gas to execute the required operations, leading to potential issues in the contract execution process.
