Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation - The contract does not restrict access to certain functions based on authorization, allowing unauthorized users to execute functions that should only be accessible to the owner.
2) inconsistent state update - There is a potential issue with updating the state of the proposal struct in the execute function without proper synchronization or atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent data.
3) atomicity violation - Updates to the votedAmount in the execute function are not done atomically, potentially leading to race conditions and unexpected behavior.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership - The ownership of the contract is declared as internal, which may not accurately reflect the intended visibility or ownership of the contract.
