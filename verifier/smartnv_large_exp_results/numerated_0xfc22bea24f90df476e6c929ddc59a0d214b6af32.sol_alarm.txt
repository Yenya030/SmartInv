The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `lockedFunds` and `startingBalanceList`, making them public by default. It is important to explicitly specify the visibility of variables to ensure proper access control.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` of the proposal is updated directly by adding the amount without checking for potential overflow issues. This can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential vulnerabilities.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a gas-intensive operation by checking if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total token supply. This can potentially lead to out-of-gas situations and transaction failures.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
