The contract provided for analysis:

contract Airdrop {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function distributeToken(address[] memory recipients, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can distribute tokens");
        
        for(uint i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
            balances[recipients[i]] += amount;
        }
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is not defined in the contract, so the check "msg.sender == owner" will always fail, allowing anyone to call the distributeToken function and distribute tokens. This could lead to unauthorized token distribution.
