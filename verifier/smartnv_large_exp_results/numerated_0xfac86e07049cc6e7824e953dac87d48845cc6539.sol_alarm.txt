The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the value of lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract's token, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple actions are performed concurrently affecting the balance.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without using any locking mechanism, which can lead to race conditions and atomicity violations.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function performs a gas-intensive operation of checking the balance and comparing it to the total supply, which can potentially run out of gas and cause the transaction to fail.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the internal owner variable is not specified, potentially exposing it to unintended access or modification by external contracts.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
