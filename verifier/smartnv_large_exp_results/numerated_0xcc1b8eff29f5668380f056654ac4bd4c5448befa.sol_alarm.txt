The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        address payable payee = msg.sender;
        uint balance = address(this).balance;
        payee.transfer(balance);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership in withdrawFunds function
2) Insufficient gas for operations involving transferring funds

Output:
incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas
