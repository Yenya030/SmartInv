The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBalanceList` without checking if the proposal is valid or taking into consideration potential reentrancy attacks.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but does not define the required functions. This might lead to incorrect behavior or ownership mismatch.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct doesn't have a unique identifier, which could lead to potential conflicts or errors when handling multiple proposals.

4) Business logic flaw: The function `endExecute` checks for a condition that executing should fail based on the comparison of balances, which may not be a sound method to determine the success or failure of the execution.

5) Atomicity violation: There is no use of atomic operations for updating state variables such as `proposal.votedAmount += amount`.

6) Ether leakage: The contract uses `transferFrom` without proper error handling, which can lead to ether being trapped in the contract if a transfer fails.

7) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations involving balances and amount handling, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow issues if not properly checked.

8) Suicidal contracts: There is no implementation of a self-destruct function in the contract, but if added without proper precautions, it could lead to the contract becoming unusable and funds getting locked.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, ID uniqueness violation, business logic flaw, atomicity violation, ether leakage, integer overflow/underflow, and suicidal contracts.
