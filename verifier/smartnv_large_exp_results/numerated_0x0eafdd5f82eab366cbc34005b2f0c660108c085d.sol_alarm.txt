The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSwap {
     IERC20 public token1;
     IERC20 public token2;
     
     function swapTokens(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
         token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
         token2.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount2);
         
         token1.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
         token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount1);
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
- Inconsistent state update: The contract does not ensure that both token transfers happen successfully before updating the state, which could lead to an inconsistent state if one transfer fails and the other succeeds.
- Insufficient gas: The contract might run out of gas if the transfer operations consume too much gas, preventing the state update from completing.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: Depending on the ownership or visibility requirements, this contract might need additional access control to prevent unauthorized calls to the swapTokens function.
- Atomicity violation: The swapTokens function involves multiple token transfers without considering the atomicity of these operations, possibly allowing for unexpected results if one transfer fails while the other succeeds.
