The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) arithmetic flaw: The division in the calculatePrice function may lead to an arithmetic flaw if the divisor (WETH.balanceOf(address(pair))) is 0.
2) insufficient gas: The liquidate function may run out of gas if the getPrice() or the transfer functions consume too much gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are arithmetic flaw and insufficient gas.
