The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined with a visibility specifier, which can lead to unexpected behaviors and potential vulnerabilities related to ownership.

3) Business logic flaw: The validation in the `endExecute` function to check if `execution has failed` seems to be incorrect and could potentially lead to unexpected behavior. 

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
