Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Reentrancy vulnerability in the execute function where external calls are made before updating state variables.
2) ID uniqueness violation in the startExecute function where the proposal struct might not have a unique identifier assigned.
3) Inconsistent state update in the endExecute function where the condition for checking execution failure might not accurately reflect the actual state of the contract.
