Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 internally, which may not be intended and could lead to unexpected behaviors.
2) Inconsistent state update: The startExecute function updates the proposal state without considering the impact on other functions that rely on this state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that consumes a significant amount of gas, which might lead to out-of-gas exceptions.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The usage of proposal.addr as a unique identifier for proposals may lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are submitted by the same address.
5) Atomicity violation: The endExecute function does multiple state changes without considering the atomicity of these changes, which could lead to unexpected results.
