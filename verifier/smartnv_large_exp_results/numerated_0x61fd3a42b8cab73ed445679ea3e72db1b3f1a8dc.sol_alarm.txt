The contract provided is:

contract Crowdsale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function buyTokens(address _buyer, uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can buy tokens");
        balances[_buyer] += _amount;
    }

    function withdrawTokens(address _buyer) public {
        require(msg.sender == _buyer, "Only the buyer can withdraw tokens");
        uint amount = balances[_buyer];
        balances[_buyer] = 0;
        // Withdraw tokens to the buyer
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The buyTokens function allows the owner to buy tokens for any address, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes the owner's address to all users, potentially compromising ownership security.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the Crowdsale contract are privilege escalation and incorrect visibility/ownership.
