Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The debt and collateral mappings are updated without proper checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function may lead to integer overflow/underflow if the values involved are large, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
3) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function calculates the price based on the current balance of USDC and WETH in the pair contract, which can be manipulated by malicious actors to manipulate the price.
4) Insufficient gas: The liquidate function performs multiple token transfers, which could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
