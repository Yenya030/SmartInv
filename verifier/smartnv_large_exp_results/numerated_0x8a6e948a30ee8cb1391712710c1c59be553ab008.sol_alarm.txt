The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You have already voted");
        require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;

            require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation");
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;

        Voter storage delegate = voters[to];
        if (delegate.voted) {
            voters[delegate.vote].weight += sender.weight;
        } else {
            delegate.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint256 proposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "Already voted.");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = proposal;
    }
}

Output:
1) Business logic flaw: The delegate function does not update the voter's weight correctly when delegating to a delegate who has already voted, which can lead to inaccurate voting results.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the delegate function, the state of voters[delegate.vote].weight might not be correctly updated when a delegate who has already voted receives additional weight from another voter.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The delegate function does not prevent multiple voters from delegating their vote to the same delegate, potentially causing confusion in vote delegation.
