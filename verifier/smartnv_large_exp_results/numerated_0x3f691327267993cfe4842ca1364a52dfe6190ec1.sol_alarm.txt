Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update - The function startExecute updates the state of the proposal without checking for existing proposals, potentially allowing for multiple proposals to be created simultaneously. This could lead to unexpected behavior and conflicts in the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not define the required functions, such as transfer and balanceOf. This could lead to issues with contract interoperability and functionality.
