The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the `proposal` struct in a consistent manner, leading to potential inconsistencies in the data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute` and `endExecute` functions are not specified with a visibility modifier (e.g., public, private, external), which may lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of functions, particularly in `endExecute` where a significant amount of gas may be required for the execution.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow/underflow in calculations involving balances and amounts.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, potentially leading to conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.
