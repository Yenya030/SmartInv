The contract to analyze:

contract SimpleTokenSale {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(uint initialSupply, uint tokenPrice) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balances[msg.sender] = initialSupply;
        price = tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect amount sent");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        uint amount = address(this).balance;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
