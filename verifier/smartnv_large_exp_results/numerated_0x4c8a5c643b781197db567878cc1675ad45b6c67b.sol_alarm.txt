The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20 but is not providing the necessary implementations for its functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented directly without synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function involves a transfer of tokens, which could result in running out of gas and the transaction failing if the gas provided is not enough.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced but not provided in the contract, indicating a potential issue with visibility.
5) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not atomic, leading to a potential vulnerability if an operation fails midway through the function execution.
