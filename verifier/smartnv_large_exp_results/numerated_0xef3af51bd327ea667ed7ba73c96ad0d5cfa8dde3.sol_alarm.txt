The vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Privilege escalation bug: The contract TimelockController is missing access control mechanisms for the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute, allowing anyone to call these functions without proper authorization. 
2) Inconsistent state update: In the startExecute function, there is inconsistency in updating the proposal struct. 
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not implement all the required functions. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
