The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any further processing, which might lead to inconsistent state if not updated correctly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of some variables and functions such as `proposal` and `getStartingBalance()`, which can potentially lead to accessibility or ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` might fail if the gas provided is not sufficient for the required operations, leading to incomplete execution and potential vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
