Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract executes actions based on the state of the proposal, but there are multiple functions that can modify the proposal state without proper synchronization. This could lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract claims to implement the `IERC20` interface but doesn't provide the necessary functions required by the interface. This could lead to compatibility issues with other contracts expecting a standard ERC20 interface.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas limit is reached before completing the execution, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
4) Business logic flaw: The logic of checking if the execution has ended in the `execute` function based on a 24-hour time window might lead to unexpected outcomes, as the timing might not always be accurate.
