Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the 'proposal' struct is updated in the 'startExecute' and 'execute' functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential risk of integer overflow in the 'startExecute' and 'execute' functions where the 'proposal.votedAmount' can increase beyond its maximum value if large amounts are transferred.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like 'owner', 'votingToken' is not specified which can lead to potential issues related to contract ownership and visibility.
