The following contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the starting balance of a proposal in the `startingBalanceList` mapping without actually initializing the mapping or updating it throughout the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute()` function without any visibility specifier, which could lead to issues related to visibility and ownership.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
