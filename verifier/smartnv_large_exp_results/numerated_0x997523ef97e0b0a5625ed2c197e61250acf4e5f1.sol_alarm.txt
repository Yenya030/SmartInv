The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Business logic flaw: In the "endExecute" function, the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");" could potentially have a business logic flaw if the intended logic is not properly implemented.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly define the visibility of some functions and variables, which could lead to security vulnerabilities related to access control.
