The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering any locking mechanism to prevent multiple calls that could result in incorrect or unexpected state changes.
2) Atomicity violation: There is a potential for a race condition in the `startExecute()` function where multiple calls could lead to unexpected behavior due to the lack of atomicity in updating the `proposal` struct.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership of its functions, which could lead to potential security risks if unintended users gain access to sensitive functions.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
