The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The use of the `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple executions happen concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which could potentially lead to ownership issues if not properly managed.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas provided to execute the necessary operations, leading to failed executions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
