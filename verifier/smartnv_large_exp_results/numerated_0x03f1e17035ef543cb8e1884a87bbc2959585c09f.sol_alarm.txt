The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the variable lockedFunds without ensuring that all necessary conditions are met, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The function liquidate() in the ExchangeTokens contract contains a potential arithmetic flaw in the require statement, which may result in incorrect liquidation calculations. 

3) Insufficient gas: The function calculatePrice() in the ExchangeTokens contract may suffer from insufficient gas if the required gas for the calculation exceeds the gas limit.
