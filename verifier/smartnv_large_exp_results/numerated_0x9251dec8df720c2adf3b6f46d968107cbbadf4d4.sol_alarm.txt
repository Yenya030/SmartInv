Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility or access control modifiers for the functions and state variables, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` state variable is being updated directly in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper checks or validation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Atomicity violation: The increment operation on `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function is not performed atomically, potentially leading to concurrency issues.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a large amount of gas to execute due to the calculation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which can cause out-of-gas errors.
