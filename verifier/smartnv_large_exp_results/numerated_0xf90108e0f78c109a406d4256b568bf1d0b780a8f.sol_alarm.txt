Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not account for the possibility of reentrancy attacks or other changes in the contract state that could impact the accuracy of the balance.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may potentially fail if there is insufficient gas to execute all the required operations, which could lead to unexpected behavior or partial execution of the function.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which could potentially lead to unintended access or modification of the variable by external contracts or actors. Additionally, the ownership of the contract and the control over the proposal execution process are not clearly defined, which could introduce security risks.
