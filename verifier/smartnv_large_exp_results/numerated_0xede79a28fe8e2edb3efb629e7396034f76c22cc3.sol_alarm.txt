The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

```solidity
contract Lottery {
    mapping(address => uint) public tickets;

    function buyTicket(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        tickets[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function drawWinner() public {
        uint totalTickets;
        address winner;
        for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            totalTickets += tickets[address(i)];
        }
        uint randomNumber = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp))) % totalTickets;
        for (uint j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            if (randomNumber < tickets[address(j)]) {
                winner = address(j);
                break;
            } else {
                randomNumber -= tickets[address(j)];
            }
        }
        // Transfer prize to winner
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities identified in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Integer overflow/underflow
3) Business logic flaw
