The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility for the `proposal` struct and `votingToken` variable, which could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly controlled.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no synchronization mechanism to ensure the consistency of the state, potentially leading to incorrect data.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function calls `votedProposal` without specifying the required gas limit for potential operations, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does arithmetic operations on `proposal.votedAmount` without proper checks for potential overflow or underflow issues.
5) Cross bridge inconsistency: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is potential risk of cross-bridge inconsistency if not handled correctly.
