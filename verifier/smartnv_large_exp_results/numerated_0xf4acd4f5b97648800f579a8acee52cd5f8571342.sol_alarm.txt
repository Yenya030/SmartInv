The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

- Privilege escalation: The contract does not explicitly restrict access to certain functions based on roles or permissions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute critical functions such as `execute` and `endExecute`.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the update is consistent with the intended logic of the contract.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `owner` and `votingToken` is not specified, which may lead to unintended access or manipulation of these variables by external contracts.
