Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Privilege escalation: The setProductPrice function only checks if the caller is the owner before updating the product price. This could allow unauthorized users to change the prices.
2) Inconsistent state update: The purchaseProduct function transfers the payment to the owner but does not include code to transfer the ownership of the product to the purchaser. This could lead to an inconsistent state where the ownership of the product is not properly updated after a purchase.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes the owner's address to everyone. This could be a security concern as it allows anyone to view the owner's address.
