Your contract:

contract Escrow {
         uint public escrowBalance;
         address public buyer;
         address public seller;
         
         constructor(address _buyer, address _seller) {
             buyer = _buyer;
             seller = _seller;
         }
         
         function deposit(uint amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit");
             escrowBalance += amount;
         }
         
         function release() public {
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can release funds");
             escrowBalance = 0;
         }
         
         function withdraw() public {
             require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can withdraw funds");
             escrowBalance = 0;
         }
     }

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update

Output: incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update.
