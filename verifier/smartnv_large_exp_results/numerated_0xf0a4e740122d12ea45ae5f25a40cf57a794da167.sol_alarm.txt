The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The 'endExecute' function updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without checking if the operation is secure, potentially resulting in inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The visibility of variables such as 'votingToken' and 'proposal' is not specified, which can lead to incorrect accessibility and ownership concerns.
