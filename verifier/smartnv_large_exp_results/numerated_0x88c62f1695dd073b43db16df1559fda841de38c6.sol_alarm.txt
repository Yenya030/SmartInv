The contract below has potential vulnerabilities: 

contract VotingSystem {
     uint256 public totalVotes;
     mapping(address => uint256) public userVotes;
     
     function vote(uint256 amount) public {
          require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
          totalVotes += amount;
          userVotes[msg.sender] += amount;
     }
     
     function redeemVotes() public {
          uint256 userAmount = userVotes[msg.sender];
          require(userAmount > 0, "User has no votes to redeem");
          totalVotes -= userAmount;
          userVotes[msg.sender] = 0;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Integer overflow/underflow
3) Insufficient gas
