Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the contract by assigning values to the proposal struct and startingBalanceList mapping without proper synchronization or validation, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The functions execute() and endExecute() perform multiple state changes in a single transaction without proper validation or use of mutex, which may result in atomicity violation and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() requires a significant amount of gas to execute due to the large calculation involving the balance comparison, which may result in out-of-gas exception and prevent the function from completing successfully.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but fails to properly define the visibility of the interface functions, leading to potential issues related to contract ownership and visibility.
