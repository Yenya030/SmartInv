The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but doesn't provide any implementation for the required functions, which could result in unexpected behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect those functions to be implemented.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks the balance of the contract's token and total supply comparison without considering the gas costs involved, which could lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
