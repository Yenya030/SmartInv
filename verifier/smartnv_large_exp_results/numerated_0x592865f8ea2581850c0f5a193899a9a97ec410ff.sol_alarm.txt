The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for its functions and variables, leaving them potentially accessible by any external entity.

2) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function, but there is no clear indication of how this variable is being used or managed elsewhere in the contract, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may require a significant amount of gas to execute if the condition 'require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");' is triggered, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Insufficient gas.
