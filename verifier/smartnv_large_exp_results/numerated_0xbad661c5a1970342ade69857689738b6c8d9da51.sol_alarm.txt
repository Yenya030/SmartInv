The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 id;
        uint256 tokens;
        bool hasVoted;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public totalTokens;
    uint256 public tokenPrice;

    function buyTokens(uint256 _amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Incorrect payment amount");
        totalTokens += _amount;
        voters[msg.sender].tokens += _amount;
    }

    function vote(uint256 _tokens) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].tokens >= _tokens, "Not enough tokens");
        require(!voters[msg.sender].hasVoted, "Already voted");
        voters[msg.sender].tokens -= _tokens;
        voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = true;
    }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables totalTokens and tokenPrice are publicly accessible, providing potential for manipulation or unauthorized access.
- Insufficient gas: If the tokenPrice is set too high, users may not have enough gas to execute the buyTokens function successfully.
- Inconsistent state update: The totalTokens count is updated in the buyTokens function, but no check is performed to ensure that the totalTokens count does not exceed a certain limit or that it is updated correctly in all transactions.
