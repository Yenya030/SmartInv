Based on the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable in the 'endExecute' function is updated based on the balance of the 'votingToken' contract that resides in the ExchangeTokens contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' and 'lockedFunds' variables are declared as internal, which could lead to visibility issues and affect contract ownership assumptions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
