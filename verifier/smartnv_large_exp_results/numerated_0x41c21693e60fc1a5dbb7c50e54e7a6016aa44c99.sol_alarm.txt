The following contract may have potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state of the `proposal` struct without checking if it is already initialized, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which might expose it to unintended access or manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: It is unclear if there is enough gas allocated for the execution of certain functions, which could lead to execution failures.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
