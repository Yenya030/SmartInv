Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without proper validation or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and data corruption.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs calculations using division that can potentially result in arithmetic flaws if the inputs are not properly validated or sanitized.
