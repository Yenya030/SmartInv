The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique voter IDs, allowing the same address to vote multiple times.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `hasVoted` mapping is public, exposing the voters' information publicly.
- Insufficient gas: As the contract grows with more voters, the gas cost for executing the `vote` function can increase significantly.
