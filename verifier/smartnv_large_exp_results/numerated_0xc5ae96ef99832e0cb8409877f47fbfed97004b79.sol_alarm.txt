The contract provided:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public depositAmount;
    bool public isComplete;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _depositAmount) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        depositAmount = _depositAmount;
        isComplete = false;
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only seller or arbiter can release funds");
        require(isComplete == false, "Funds already released");
        
        // release funds to seller
        seller.transfer(depositAmount);
        isComplete = true;
    }

    function refundFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only buyer or arbiter can refund funds");
        require(isComplete == false, "Funds already refunded");
        
        // refund funds to buyer
        buyer.transfer(depositAmount);
        isComplete = true;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Lack of proper access control may lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The isComplete state variable is updated within each function independently, making it susceptible to inconsistencies.
3) Atomicity violation: The releaseFunds() and refundFunds() functions perform multiple operations without atomicity guarantees, which could lead to unexpected behavior if any operation fails midway.
4) Ether leakage: Lack of proper error handling and exception mechanisms could result in funds being stuck in the contract if an operation fails.
5) Insufficient gas: Operations within releaseFunds() and refundFunds() may require more gas than provided, leading to out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.
