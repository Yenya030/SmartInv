The contract provided in the prompt does contain potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any proper synchronization mechanism, which may lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `Proposal` struct is not defined with any access control or visibility specifier, leaving it open to potential unauthorized access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
