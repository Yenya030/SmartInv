Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: the function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" variable without checking if the proposal has actually been executed, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the contract does not specify the visibility of the "votingToken" variable, which could lead to unintended access and manipulation by external contracts.

3) Insufficient gas: the contract does not handle potential gas limitations when executing functions that involve transferring tokens, which could result in transaction failures or incomplete executions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: the contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal ID, potentially leading to conflicts and unexpected behavior when managing multiple proposals.

5) Arithmetic flaw: the calculation in the "liquidate" function involving "getPrice()" and manipulating debt and collateral amounts may be susceptible to arithmetic flaws, causing potential inaccuracies in liquidation calculations.
