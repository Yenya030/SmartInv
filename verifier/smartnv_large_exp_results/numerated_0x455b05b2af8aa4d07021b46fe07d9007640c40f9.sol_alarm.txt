Contract provided for analysis:
```solidity
contract PaymentProcessor {
    address owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    modifier onlyOwner {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function setOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is not set initially and can be changed by any address since there is no access control in place.
- Insufficient gas: The `withdraw` function transfers funds directly to the caller, which can lead to out-of-gas errors if the caller is a contract that has a high gas consumption.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the balances mapping if a large amount is deposited. Additionally, underflow can occur in the `withdraw` function if the user tries to withdraw more than their balance.
