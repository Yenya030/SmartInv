Contract: TimelockController

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to have a mechanism to ensure unique proposal IDs, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the desired level of security and access control over critical contract functions.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update in the execute function where votedAmount is increased without using safe arithmetic operations like SafeMath, potentially leading to integer overflow.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a calculation based on the balance of the contract, which may require significant gas to execute if the contract holds a large amount of tokens.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, and ID uniqueness violations.
