Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) privilege escalation (using the IERC20 interface without proper authorization);
2) inconsistent state update (modifying the proposal struct without proper synchronization);
3) atomicity violation (lack of atomicity in the execute function, where multiple state changes occur without proper transactional guarantees);
4) ID uniqueness violation (potential issues with duplicate or non-unique proposal addresses);
5) incorrect visibility/ownership (lack of access control mechanisms for critical functions).
