Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the lockedFunds state variable based on the calculation of the balance of the contract, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance changes during the execution of the function.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is defined as internal, which may expose it to potential privilege escalation attacks if not properly controlled. Consider changing the visibility to private if only internal access is needed.

3) Insufficient gas: The execute function may run out of gas if the transferFrom operation consumes too much gas due to a large amount of data being transferred, leading to a potential denial-of-service attack.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The code snippet does not include any mechanisms for ensuring the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or inconsistencies if duplicate IDs are used.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions or Ether-related functions, so there is no vulnerability related to ether leakage in this contract.

6) Suicidal contracts: There are no self-destruct or suicide functions present in the contract, so there is no vulnerability related to suicidal contracts in this contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation.
