This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract lacks checks for potential integer overflow or underflow in functions that involve arithmetic calculations, such as in the `calculatePrice()` function.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables should be carefully reviewed to ensure that they are appropriately set based on the intended behavior and access control.

3) Insufficient gas: There may be cases where functions require more gas to execute successfully, and this should be carefully considered to prevent execution failures due to gas limit constraints.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
