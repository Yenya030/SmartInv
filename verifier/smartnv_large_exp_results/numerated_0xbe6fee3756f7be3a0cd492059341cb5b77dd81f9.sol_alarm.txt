Contract you are analyzing:

contract Auction {
     address public highestBidder;
     uint public highestBid;

     function placeBid(uint bidAmount) public {
          require(bidAmount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
          highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
          highestBidder = msg.sender;
          highestBid = bidAmount;
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Auction contract:
1) integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not check for potential integer overflow when calculating the new highestBid value.
2) inconsistent state update: The contract updates highestBidder and highestBid in separate steps, which could lead to inconsistent state if an exception occurs after updating one but not the other.
3) insufficient gas: The transfer function is used, which could potentially run out of gas if the bidder's fallback function consumes too much gas.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The highestBidder and highestBid variables are public, exposing sensitive information to all users.
