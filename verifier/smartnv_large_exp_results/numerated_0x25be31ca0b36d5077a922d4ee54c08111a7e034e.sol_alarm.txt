The contract in question has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function modifies the state of the `proposal` struct by incrementing `proposal.votedAmount`, but there is no safeguard against multiple executions of the function on the same proposal, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not specified with any visibility keyword, potentially exposing it to external manipulation. Additionally, the `votedProposal` function is referenced without visibility specified, which can lead to ownership and accessibility issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to insufficient gas if the operations within it consume more gas than available during execution, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
