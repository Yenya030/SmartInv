This contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The potential vulnerability can arise in the `endExecute` function where the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` is used. The state update `lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));` happens after this condition, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the code snippet, but it is not provided in the contract code. This could lead to an incorrect visibility or ownership vulnerability if the `votedProposal` function has critical operations that are not accessible or owned by the intended entities.
