Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is internal, which might not provide the desired access control.
2) Inconsistent state update: The startingBlance variable is spelled incorrectly as startingBalance, which could lead to unintended behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: The execution of multiple functions (startExecute, execute, endExecute) relies on external calls like votingToken.transferFrom, which might not be atomic, leading to unexpected results.
4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, certain functions like endExecute that require transferring tokens and checking balances could run out of gas.
5) Incorrect arithmetic: In the endExecute function, the condition checking if the locked funds are double the balance could be subject to incorrect arithmetic or lack of precision due to division.
6) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which could lead to confusion or conflicts.
7) Inconsistent state update: The startingBalanceList mapping is only updated in the startExecute function but not used or updated elsewhere, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
