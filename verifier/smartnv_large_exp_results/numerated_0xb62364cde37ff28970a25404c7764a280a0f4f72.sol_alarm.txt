The contract in question contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without checking if a proposal is already ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a large amount of gas due to the comparison `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could lead to insufficient gas for the transaction.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
