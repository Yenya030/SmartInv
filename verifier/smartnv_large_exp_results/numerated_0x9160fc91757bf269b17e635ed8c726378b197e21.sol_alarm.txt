Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of functions and variables, which can lead to unintended access by external parties.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is incremented without proper synchronization or checks, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require an excessive amount of gas to perform the token transfer, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
4) Incorrect arithmetic logic: The arithmetic logic in the `liquidate` function may result in unexpected outcomes due to improper calculations.
5) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a lack of proper validation or synchronization between the `debt` and `collateral` mappings, which could lead to inconsistencies or manipulation.
6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, leaving it vulnerable to ether leakage attacks.
