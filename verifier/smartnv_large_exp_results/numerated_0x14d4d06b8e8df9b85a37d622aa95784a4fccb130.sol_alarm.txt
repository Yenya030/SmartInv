The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The update of the proposal.votedAmount in the execute function is not atomic and may lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions is external, which might not be suitable for the intended functionality. Additionally, the contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not fully define all the required functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
