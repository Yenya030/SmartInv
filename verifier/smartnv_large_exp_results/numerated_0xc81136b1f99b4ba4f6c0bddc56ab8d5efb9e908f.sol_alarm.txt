The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the struct Proposal, which could lead to potential security issues.
2) inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) atomicity violation: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
4) insufficient gas: The function endExecute() performs a gas-intensive operation (checking balance) which may exceed the gas limit and cause the transaction to fail.
