Contract:

contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyToken(uint amount) external payable {
        uint totalAmount = amount * tokenPrice;
        require(msg.value >= totalAmount, "Insufficient payment");

        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        owner.transfer(totalAmount);
    }

    function updateTokenPrice(uint newPrice) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update token price");
        tokenPrice = newPrice;
    }
}

Output:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows the owner to update the token price, which could potentially result in inconsistent state if the owner changes the price unexpectedly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The updateTokenPrice function should be restricted to only the owner, but the current implementation does not check if the caller is the owner in a secure manner.
3) Ether leakage: Using transfer to send funds to the owner can lead to ether leakage in case the owner is not an EOA or a contract without a payable fallback function. It is recommended to use a withdrawal pattern for transferring funds to external addresses to prevent potential issues with funds not being sent correctly.
