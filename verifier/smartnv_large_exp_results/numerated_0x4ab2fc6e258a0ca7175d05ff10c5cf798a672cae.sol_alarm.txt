Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the variables "owner" and "votingToken", which could lead to accessibility and ownership control issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated in the "execute" function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent data state.
3) Insufficient gas: The "execute" function could potentially run out of gas if the transaction consumes more gas than available, leading to failed execution.
4) Inconsistent state update: The "startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]" is updated in the "startExecute" function without proper validation or checks, which could lead to inconsistent data state.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The function "votedProposal" is referenced in the code but not provided in the contract, potentially leading to visibility and accessibility issues.
6) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function could potentially run out of gas if the transaction consumes more gas than available, leading to failed execution.
7) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include any self-destruct or suicide function, which could potentially be exploited to drain funds or render the contract unusable.
