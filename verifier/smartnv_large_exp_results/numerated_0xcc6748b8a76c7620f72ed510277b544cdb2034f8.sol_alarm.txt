The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _seller, address _buyer, uint _price) {
        seller = _seller;
        buyer = _buyer;
        price = _price;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit");
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect deposit amount");
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can release funds");
        payable(seller).transfer(price);
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can request a refund");
        payable(buyer).transfer(price);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables `seller`, `buyer`, and `price` is public, which may not be intended. It is recommended to set these state variables as private and provide getter functions if necessary to access their values.

2) Insufficient gas: The `release()` and `refund()` functions transfer funds directly to the `seller` and `buyer` respectively. If the `seller` or `buyer` is a contract that does not handle incoming Ether properly, it can lead to funds being stuck. It is recommended to use withdrawal patterns to allow users to withdraw funds instead of transferring funds directly.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership and Insufficient gas.
