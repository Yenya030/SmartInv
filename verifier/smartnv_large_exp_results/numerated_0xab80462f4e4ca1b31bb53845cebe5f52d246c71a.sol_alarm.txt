There are several potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not restrict who can call the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to manipulate proposals and execute transactions.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount without properly handling potential reentrant calls, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function tries to perform a complex operation of calculating the balance of the contract relative to the total supply within a single transaction, which might result in running out of gas and lead to transaction failure.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
