The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as it relies on a calculation in getPrice() which might not provide accurate results for liquidation.

2) Integer underflow: The liquidate function may be susceptible to integer underflow if the calculation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) results in a value lower than dAmount. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
