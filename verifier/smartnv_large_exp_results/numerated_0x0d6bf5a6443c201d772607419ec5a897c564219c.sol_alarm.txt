The contract for analysis:
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public price;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        uint cost = amount * price;
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cost, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, cost);
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        token.transfer(owner, address(this).balance);
    }

    function setPrice(uint newPrice) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set price");
        price = newPrice;
    }
}

Output:
1) There is no vulnerability detected in this contract. It is healthy.
