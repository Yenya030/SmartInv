Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being directly incremented in the `execute` function, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.
2) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the `endExecute` function, especially when the `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` check consumes a significant amount of gas.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables `owner`, `votingToken`, and `proposal` is not specified, which can lead to potential accessibility issues. Additionally, the `owner` variable is not being utilized in the contract, raising questions about ownership control.
