The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` contains a require statement that checks if the balance of the contract is at least half of the total supply of the token, which could consume excessive gas and lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define all the required functions, which could result in incorrect behavior or potential ownership vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Insufficient gas
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
