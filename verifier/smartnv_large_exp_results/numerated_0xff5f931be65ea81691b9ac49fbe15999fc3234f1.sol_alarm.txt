Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the 'proposal' struct and 'startingBalanceList' mapping is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
- Inconsistent state update: The 'execute' function updates the 'proposal.votedAmount' without checking if the transaction was successful, leading to a potential inconsistent state if the transfer fails.
- Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may run out of gas if there are a large number of voters, as it checks if the lockedFunds exceed a certain threshold without specifying a gas limit.
- ID uniqueness violation: The 'proposal' struct does not include a unique identifier, which could lead to conflicts or confusion if multiple proposals are created at the same time.
- Atomicity violation: Several operations in the functions are not atomic, such as checking proposal conditions and updating state variables separately, which could lead to race conditions.
- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, which could potentially lead to Ether being sent to the contract accidentally and get trapped.
