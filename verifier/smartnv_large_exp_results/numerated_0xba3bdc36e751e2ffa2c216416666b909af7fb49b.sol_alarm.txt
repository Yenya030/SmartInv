The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "startExecute()" function updates the state of the proposal struct without checking for existing proposals, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute()" function checks the total balance of tokens against the total token supply, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas and result in insufficient gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "lockedFunds" variable is not specified, which could lead to potential visibility issues or ownership concerns.
