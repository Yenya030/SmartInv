Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are declared as internal, which could potentially lead to vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) that could lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function requires a gas-intensive operation of checking if the balance is more than double the total token supply, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or manipulation.
5) Atomicity violation: Multiple operations in the functions are not handled atomically, which could lead to unexpected behaviors if an operation fails halfway through.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- ID uniqueness violation
- Atomicity violation
