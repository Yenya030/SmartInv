The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    uint256 private latestVoteId;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public votes;

    function vote(uint256 voteValue) public {
        totalVotes++;
        votes[latestVoteId] = voteValue;
    }

    function changeVote(uint256 voteId, uint256 newValue) public {
        require(voteId <= latestVoteId, "Invalid vote id");
        votes[voteId] = newValue;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Inconsistent state update
