The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalVotes;

    mapping(address => uint) public userVotes;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    function vote() public {
        totalVotes++;
        userVotes[msg.sender]++;
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function resetVotes(address user) public onlyOwner {
        totalVotes -= userVotes[user];
        userVotes[user] = 0;
    }
}
```

Output:
- `privilege escalation`
- `incorrect visibility/ownership`
