The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, which can be manipulated before the function call, leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is declared as a global variable, which could potentially expose sensitive information to external entities. It would be better to use proper access control and visibility specifiers.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks for the balance of the contract and performs a transfer, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas exceptions if the gas provided is not sufficient for the operations.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
