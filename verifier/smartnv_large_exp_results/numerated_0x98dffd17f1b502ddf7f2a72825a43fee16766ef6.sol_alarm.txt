The contract being analyzed contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The function endExecute() checks if the execution has ended by comparing the proposal's sTime value with the current block timestamp, which may lead to a business logic flaw if the timestamps are manipulated.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal visibility of the owner variable may lead to incorrect access control and ownership vulnerabilities in the contract. 

3) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount field of the Proposal struct without using the . notation, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if not properly handled.

4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may fail if there is insufficient gas to complete the desired operations, leading to potential issues in the contract execution. 

5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for ensuring unique IDs for proposals, which can lead to ID duplication and potential conflicts in the contract.
