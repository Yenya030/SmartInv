The contract has the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) privilege escalation: The contract allows the startExecute function to be called externally, which could lead to unauthorized users initiating new proposals.
2) inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount field of the proposal struct without using a mutex or other synchronization mechanism, which could result in inconsistent state if called concurrently.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal state variables owner and votingToken are declared with an internal visibility, which may not be intended and could expose them unintentionally.
