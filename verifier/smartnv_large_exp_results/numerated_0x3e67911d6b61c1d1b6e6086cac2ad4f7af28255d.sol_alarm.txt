The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the variable votingToken to transfer tokens and update the votedAmount in the execute function, but it does not update the state of the votingToken contract after the transfer. This can lead to an inconsistent state where the contract's state does not accurately reflect the transfer of tokens.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract provides external visibility to the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions, which can potentially expose the contract to unauthorized access or manipulation. It is important to consider restricting the visibility of sensitive functions to prevent unauthorized users from interacting with the contract.
