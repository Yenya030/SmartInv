Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20 without actually defining the functions required by the interface. This could lead to issues with ownership and visibility of functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the function startExecute(), the startingBalanceList is updated with the starting balance before the proposal is finalized. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function checks if the execution has ended based on timestamps, which might not consider gas limits and potential delays in block confirmation.
