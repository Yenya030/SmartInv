For the given contract:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 sTime; 
        uint256 votedAmount; 
        address addr; 
    }
    address internal owner;
    IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
        uint256 startingBlance;
        require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
        proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
        startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
        startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 
    }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
        require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
        votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
        proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
        votedProposal(proposal); 
    }

    function endExecute() external {
        require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
        require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
        lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}

Based on the analysis of the contract provided, here are the potential vulnerabilities identified:

1) Business logic flaw: The functionality related to proposals and execution within the contract may have flaws in the logic flow, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or results.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables within the contract may not be properly defined, which could result in unauthorized access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are business logic flaw and incorrect visibility/ownership.
