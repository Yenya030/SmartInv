The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the proposal state without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent states.

2) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of functions due to potentially complex operations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the ownership of the contract is properly managed, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
