Contract Analysis:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables being updated within different functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data state.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may require a significant amount of gas to execute, and if the gas limit is insufficient, it could result in the function failing to complete.
3) Privilege escalation: The usage of the owner address variable may lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
4) Atomicity violation: The operations within the execute() function are not executed atomically, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not specified, which may lead to unexpected behaviors or security issues related to access control.
