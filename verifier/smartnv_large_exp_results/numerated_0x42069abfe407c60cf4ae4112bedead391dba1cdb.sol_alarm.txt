Contract:

contract SwapTokens {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function swap(uint amountA, uint amountB) external {
        require(amountA > 0 && amountB > 0, "Invalid swap amounts");

        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);

        tokenA.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountA);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Atomicity violation: The swap function does not ensure that both token transfers occur together atomically, opening up the possibility of one transfer succeeding while the other fails.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for the tokenA and tokenB variables, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modification.
3) Insufficient gas: If the swap function requires excessive gas to execute due to multiple token transfers, it may run out of gas mid-execution, leading to incomplete or failed swaps.
