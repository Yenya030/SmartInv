Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Atomicity violation in the startExecute function where multiple state changes occur without being wrapped in a single transaction.
2) ID uniqueness violation as there is no mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals.
3) Ether leakage in the execute function where ether is transferred without appropriate checks.
4) Inconsistent state update in the endExecute function where the lockedFunds variable is updated without proper validation or handling.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, ID uniqueness violation, ether leakage, and inconsistent state update.
