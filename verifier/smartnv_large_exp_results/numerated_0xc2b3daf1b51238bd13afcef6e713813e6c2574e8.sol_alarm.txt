The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the variables 'proposal', 'startingBalanceList', 'lockedFunds' and the functions 'votedProposal', 'getStartingBalance'. This can lead to potential security risks as the visibility might not be properly set.

2) Insufficient Gas: The function 'endExecute' performs a gas-intensive operation by checking if 'votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()', which could potentially lead to running out of gas.

3) Inconsistent State Update: In the function 'execute()', the update to 'proposal.votedAmount' is directly done with '+=' without properly handling race conditions, which might lead to inconsistent state updates.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Incorrect Visibility/Ownership, Insufficient Gas, and Inconsistent State Update.
