The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state of the proposal using the proposal variable without initializing it first, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() uses a potentially expensive operation (checking if balance * 2 is greater than total supply) which can consume a lot of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the proposal struct and the startingBalanceList mapping, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
