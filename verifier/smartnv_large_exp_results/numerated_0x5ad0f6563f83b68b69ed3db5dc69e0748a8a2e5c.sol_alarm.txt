The contract provided for analysis:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;

    enum State { Created, Locked, Released, Inactive}
    State public state;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        state = State.Created;
    }

    function confirmPurchase() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can confirm");
        state = State.Locked;
    }

    function confirmReceived() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only buyer or arbiter can confirm");
        state = State.Released;
    }

    function refundBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only seller or arbiter can refund");
        state = State.Inactive;
    }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The state variable is public, allowing anyone to directly access and modify it. This may lead to unauthorized changes in the state of the contract.
- Business Logic Flaw: The 'confirmReceived' function allows either the buyer or the arbiter to confirm the received item, which may result in inconsistency or improper resolution of disputes between the parties.
- Privilege Escalation: The 'refundBuyer' function allows the seller or arbiter to refund the buyer, potentially leading to misuse of authority or unauthorized refunds.
- Inconsistent State Update: The state variable is directly set in each function without proper checks or safeguards, which could result in unexpected state transitions or inconsistent contract state.
- Cross Bridge Inconsistency: The contract involves multiple parties (buyer, seller, arbiter) with different roles, which may lead to conflicts of interest or disputes that are not properly resolved.
