The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, and `startingBalanceList`, which can lead to unexpected behavior or access control issues.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`), which can lead to inconsistent state transitions if not managed properly.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a potential risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions, especially `endExecute` where a large computation is required to check if the execution failed.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Insufficient gas.
