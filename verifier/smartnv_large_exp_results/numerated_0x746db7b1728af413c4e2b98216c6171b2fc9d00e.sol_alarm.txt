The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function sets the `lockedFunds` variable without checking if the proposal has actually been executed, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not defined in the contract, which could lead to issues with visibility and ownership control.
