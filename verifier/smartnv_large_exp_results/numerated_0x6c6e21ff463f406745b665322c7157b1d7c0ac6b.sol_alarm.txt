Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating proposal state variables like `proposal.sTime`, `proposal.votedAmount`, and `startingBalanceList` without using appropriate locking mechanisms, which could lead to race conditions and inconsistent state updates.

2) Reentrancy: The `execute` function of the contract transfers tokens and then updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without taking into account reentrancy issues, potentially allowing an attacker to reenter the function and manipulate the state or perform malicious actions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface which suggests it might be a token contract, but there is no implementation of the standard token functions like `transfer` and `balanceOf`. This could lead to issues related to incorrect visibility or ownership of the token functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Reentrancy, Incorrect visibility/ownership.
