The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of tokens held by the contract, but it does not consider the possibility of the balance changing between the check and update, leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but doesn't fully define all the required functions, including functions like `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `balanceOf`, etc., which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: Some functions like `execute()` and `endExecute()` may require a significant amount of gas due to potential token transfers or balance checks, which could result in out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.
