Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute is setting the lockedFunds without checking or updating any other variables to ensure consistency in the contract's state.
2) Atomicity violation: The execute function performs multiple operations without using a locking mechanism to ensure that no other operations can interfere in between, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
