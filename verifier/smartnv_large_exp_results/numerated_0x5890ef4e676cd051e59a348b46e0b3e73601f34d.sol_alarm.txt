The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the functions and variables. It is important to explicitly set the visibility of functions and variables to prevent unintended access or modification.

2) Missing input validation: The `liquidate` function does not perform input validation on the `user` parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid address is provided.

3) Possible integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the `liquidate` function involving `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` can potentially result in integer overflow if the values involved are large.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Missing input validation
- Possible integer overflow/underflow
