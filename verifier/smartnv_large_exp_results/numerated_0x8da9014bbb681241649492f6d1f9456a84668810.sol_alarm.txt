- Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any checks or validations, which could lead to incorrect state updates.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is called without being defined within the contract, implying that it may not have the correct visibility or ownership permissions.
- Insufficient gas: It is possible that the gas provided in certain transactions may not be enough to complete the operations within the functions, leading to potential failures or incomplete executions.
