Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without specifying where it is declared and initialized, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which might restrict access to it outside the contract, potentially causing ownership issues.
3) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute()` function calculates the condition for execution based on the balance of `votingToken`, which may not accurately reflect the execution status, leading to a potential business logic flaw.
