The contract provided for analysis:

contract PaymentContract {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function getBalance(address user) public view returns(uint) {
        return balances[user];
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer underflow in the "withdraw" function when subtracting the "amount" from the user's balance. If the "amount" is higher than the user's balance, it could lead to an integer underflow issue.
2) Ether leakage: In the "withdraw" function, transferring the "amount" directly to the user using "msg.sender.transfer(amount)" can potentially lead to ether leakage if the transfer fails and leaves the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify any gas limits for the operations, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "balances" mapping is declared as public, which means anyone can access the balances of any address. This could potentially be a privacy concern depending on the use case of the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Ether leakage
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
