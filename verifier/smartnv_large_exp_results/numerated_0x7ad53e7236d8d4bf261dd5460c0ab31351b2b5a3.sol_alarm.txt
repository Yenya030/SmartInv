The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly checking if it is the correct state to do so, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables `owner` and `votingToken`, which could lead to unintended access and manipulation of these variables by external contracts.
