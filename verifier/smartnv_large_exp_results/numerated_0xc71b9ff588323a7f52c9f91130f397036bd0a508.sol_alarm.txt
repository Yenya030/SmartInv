Contract to analyze:
contract TokenSale {
    address public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;
    
    constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }
    
    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
    
    function setPrice(uint _price) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set price");
        price = _price;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
} 

Output:
