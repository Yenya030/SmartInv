Vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if the sender is authorized to do so, potentially allowing unauthorized privilege escalation.
2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() performs multiple state changes without using a lock or reentrancy guard, which can lead to inconsistent state updates or race conditions.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, potentially exposing ownership control to external contracts or unauthorized users.
