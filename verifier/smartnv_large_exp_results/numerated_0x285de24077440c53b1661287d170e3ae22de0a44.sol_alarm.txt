The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations that involve arithmetic calculations without proper checks for potential overflow or underflow.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution, especially in the endExecute function where it interacts with external contracts without handling gas properly.
