The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function does not have any access control mechanism, allowing anyone to start a new proposal and potentially escalate their privileges.

2) Consistent state update: In the `execute` function, there is a potential issue with inconsistent state updates where `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without proper synchronization, leading to incorrect state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as an internal variable but is used in the functions as if it should be public or external, which can lead to visibility issues.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` consumes a large amount of gas.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
