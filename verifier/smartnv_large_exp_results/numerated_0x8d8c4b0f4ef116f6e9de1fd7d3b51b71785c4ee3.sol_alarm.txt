The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `owner`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks a mechanism to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may result in unexpected behavior or conflicts.

3) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total token supply for execution, which may not be a valid condition for determining successful execution.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle scenarios where the gas provided during execution of functions may be insufficient, leading to the failure of transactions.

5) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract execute multiple operations sequentially without ensuring atomicity, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates or reentrancy issues.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether management explicitly, which may result in unintended loss or mishandling of Ether.

7) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations without explicitly checking for potential overflows or underflows, which could lead to unexpected results or vulnerabilities.

8) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables `proposal` and `lockedFunds` based on conditions that may not accurately reflect the intended logic, leading to inconsistencies in the contract state.

9) Reentrancy: The contract interacts with external contracts (e.g., `votingToken`) without implementing appropriate checks for reentrancy, potentially enabling reentrancy attacks.

10) Privilege escalation: The contract allows for the possibility of privilege escalation by not properly verifying the permissions of the caller in certain functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include Incorrect visibility/ownership, ID uniqueness violation, Business logic flaw, Insufficient gas, Atomicity violation, Ether leakage, Integer overflow/underflow, Inconsistent state update, Reentrancy, and Privilege escalation.
