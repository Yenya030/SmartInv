Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the state variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract at that specific moment. This can lead to inconsistent state management as the balance can change between different function calls.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential integer overflow in the function calculatePrice if the balance of USDC or WETH in the pair contract exceeds the maximum value that uint can hold, leading to incorrect price calculation.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract relies on external calls to transfer tokens, which can potentially run out of gas if the gas limit is not set appropriately, causing the function to fail.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The access modifier for internal variables like owner in the TimelockController is not specified, potentially leading to incorrect access control and visibility issues.
