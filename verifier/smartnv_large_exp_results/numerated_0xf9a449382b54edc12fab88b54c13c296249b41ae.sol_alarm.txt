The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract allows for the startExecute function to be called externally without proper access control, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
2) inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) atomicity violation: The endExecute function performs multiple state-changing operations without using proper atomicity, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if there are proper visibility and ownership controls in place for the contract functions and variables.
