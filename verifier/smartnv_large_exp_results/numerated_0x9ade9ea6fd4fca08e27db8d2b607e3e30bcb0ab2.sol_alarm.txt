The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" variable based on the balance of tokens held by the contract, which may not represent the actual locked funds accurately due to potential transfers or interactions with the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "lockedFunds" variable is not specified as public or internal, which may lead to potential issues with visibility and ownership control.

3) Insufficient gas: The function "endExecute" performs multiple balance checks and comparisons, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
