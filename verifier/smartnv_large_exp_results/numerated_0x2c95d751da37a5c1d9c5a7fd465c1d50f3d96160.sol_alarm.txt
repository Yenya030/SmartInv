The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation bug: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the endExecute function might lead to an inconsistent state update due to the calculation for lockedFunds being based on the current balance, which can change during the execution of the function.
