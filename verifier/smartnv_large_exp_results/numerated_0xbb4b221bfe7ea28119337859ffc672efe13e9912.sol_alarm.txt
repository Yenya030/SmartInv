The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables (proposal, startingBalanceList, lockedFunds) being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but doesn't have the required ERC20 functions like transfer, approve, etc. This could lead to ownership issues and visibility problems in the contract.
