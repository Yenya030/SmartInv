The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Inconsistent state update: In the function `startExecute()`, the `startingBlance` variable is misspelled as `startingBalanceList`, leading to inconsistent state update. 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract claims to implement the interface `IERC20` but does not provide any implementation for all the required functions, such as `transfer` and `balanceOf`, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
