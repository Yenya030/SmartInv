<\example_1\> Contract potential vulnerabilities: 
1) inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly with `proposal.votedAmount += amount` without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not properly define the required functions, potentially leading to ownership and visibility issues.

<\example_2\> Contract potential vulnerabilities:
1) price manipulation: The `liquidate` function may be vulnerable to price manipulation as the liquidation condition relies on the result of `getPrice()` which may not be secure.
2) privilege escalation: The `liquidate` function does not have proper access control mechanisms, allowing any user to call it and potentially conduct a privileged escalation attack.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities, including inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, price manipulation, and privilege escalation.
