The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal.sTime` without checking if a proposal is already ongoing, leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal` which may not restrict access to only the owner, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized parties.
