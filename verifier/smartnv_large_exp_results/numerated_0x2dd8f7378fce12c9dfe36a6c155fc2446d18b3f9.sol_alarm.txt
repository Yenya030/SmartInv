Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update - The function `lockFunds` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any checks or validations, which could lead to unexpected state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `lockedFunds` and `proposal`, which could lead to potential issues related to data access and manipulation.
