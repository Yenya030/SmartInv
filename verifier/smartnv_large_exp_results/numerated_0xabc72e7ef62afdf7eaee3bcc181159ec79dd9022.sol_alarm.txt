Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There are no mechanisms in place to ensure that the IDs used for proposals are unique, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for this variable. This could potentially lead to issues related to access control.

3) Inconsistent state update: The lockedFunds variable is updated in the function endExecute based on a condition involving the balance of the contract. However, this update is not atomic and could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include gas considerations for the execution of functions, which could result in transactions failing due to insufficient gas.

5) Arithmetic flaw: There are arithmetic calculations in the contract that involve token amounts and balances, which could potentially result in overflow or underflow issues if not carefully handled.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not implement mechanisms to prevent ether leakage, which could lead to loss of funds or unexpected behavior.

7) Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws in the execution of proposals and handling of balances, which could lead to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities.
