This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update in the execute function, as the votedAmount of the proposal is incremented without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is not specified, making it potentially accessible to external contracts.
