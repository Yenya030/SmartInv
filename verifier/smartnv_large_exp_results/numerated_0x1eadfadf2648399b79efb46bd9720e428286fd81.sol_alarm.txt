The contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function vote() public {
        require(hasVoted[msg.sender] == false, "Already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }
    
    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Output:
1) privilege escalation
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
