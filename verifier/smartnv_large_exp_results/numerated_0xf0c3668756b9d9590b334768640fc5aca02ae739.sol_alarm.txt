Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Integer Overflow/Underflow - There is a possibility of integer underflow in the liquidate function if the calculation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) results in a value lower than dAmount.
2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership - The debt and collateral mappings are currently public, which exposes the user's debt and collateral information to anyone. This could lead to privacy concerns or manipulation.
3) Price Manipulation - The calculatePrice function may be susceptible to price manipulation if external factors can influence the balances of USDC and WETH in the Uniswap pair.
