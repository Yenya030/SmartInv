The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract ExampleContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function getBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[account];
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The `balances` mapping may be susceptible to integer overflow/underflow when adding or subtracting values.
2) Ether leakage: The `withdraw` function may result in ether leakage if the `transfer` function fails.
3) Insufficient gas: The `withdraw` function may run out of gas if the balance of the `msg.sender` is too large.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `balances` mapping is public, exposing the balances of all accounts to anyone. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Ether leakage
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
