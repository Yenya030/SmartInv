The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify explicit visibility for the `votingToken` and `proposal` variables, which could lead to unintended accessibility and modification by external contracts.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could result in inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas limit is not sufficient to complete the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an incomplete state.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior when handling multiple proposals simultaneously.
