The following contract may contain potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated without proper checks or safeguards, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions due to complex operations or extensive loops.

3) Potential reentrancy: There is a lack of explicit checks to prevent reentrancy attacks in functions that involve token transfers, such as `execute` and `liquidate`.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and potential reentrancy.
