Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is updated in `startExecute()` and `execute()` functions without any synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state. 
- Atomicity violation: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute()` function without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to race conditions.
- Privilege escalation: There is no access control mechanism in place to restrict certain functions to only authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for duplicate proposals being created, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions should be carefully considered to ensure proper access control and encapsulation of data.

Output: 
- inconsistent state update
- atomicity violation
- privilege escalation
- ID uniqueness violation
- incorrect visibility/ownership
