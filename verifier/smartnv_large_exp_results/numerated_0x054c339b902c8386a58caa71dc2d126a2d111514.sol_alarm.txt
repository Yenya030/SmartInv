The contract being analyzed:

contract Crowdsale {
     address payable public owner;
     address public tokenAddress;
     uint public tokenPrice;
     uint public totalTokens;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     constructor(address _tokenAddress, uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) public {
         owner = msg.sender;
         tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
         tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
         totalTokens = _totalTokens;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
         require(msg.value == _numTokens * tokenPrice, "Incorrect amount sent");
         require(_numTokens <= totalTokens, "Not enough tokens available");
         totalTokens -= _numTokens;
         balances[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
     }

     function withdrawFunds() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
         owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }

     function transferTokens(address _to, uint _numTokens) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= _numTokens, "Not enough tokens to transfer");
         balances[msg.sender] -= _numTokens;
         balances[_to] += _numTokens;
     }
}

Output: 
- The contract contains incorrect visibility/ownership issue in the function withdrawFunds().
- The contract is missing proper access control in both buyTokens() and transferTokens().
- The contract is vulnerable to integer underflow in the buyTokens() function.
- The contract lacks an atomicity control mechanism in the buyTokens() function, as totalTokens is decremented before updating the balance, which might lead to inconsistent states.
