The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute" updates the proposal state without checking if there is an ongoing proposal, leading to a potential inconsistency in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the "IERC20" interface but does not define any of its functions, potentially causing issues related to visibility and ownership.

3) Insufficient gas: The function "endExecute" locks funds based on a condition that calculates the balance of the contract, which might consume significant gas and lead to out-of-gas exceptions.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
