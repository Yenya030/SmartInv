The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using a proper atomic operation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which may expose it to external manipulation and should be more restricted in visibility for security.
3) Potential ID uniqueness violation: It appears that the `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier, which could potentially lead to ID uniqueness violations if multiple proposals are created simultaneously.
