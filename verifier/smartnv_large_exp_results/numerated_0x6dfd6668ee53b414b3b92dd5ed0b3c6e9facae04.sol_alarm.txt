The contract that needs analysis: 

contract MultiSigWallet {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balance;
    mapping(address => bool) public isOwner;
    address[] public owners;
    uint public numConfirmationsRequired;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balance[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(_amount);
    }

    function addOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(!isOwner[_owner], "Owner already exists");
        isOwner[_owner] = true;
        owners.push(_owner);
    }

    function removeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(isOwner[_owner], "Owner does not exist");
        isOwner[_owner] = false;
        for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            if (owners[i] == _owner) {
                delete owners[i];
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    function changeNumConfirmationsRequired(uint _numConfirmationsRequired) public {
        numConfirmationsRequired = _numConfirmationsRequired;
    }

    function executeTransaction(address _to, uint _amount) public {
        require(balance[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the MultiSigWallet contract:
1) inconsistent state update - The removeOwner function may cause inconsistent state as it deletes an owner from the owners array without adjusting the array length.
2) ID uniqueness violation - The addOwner function does not check for duplicate owners before adding a new owner, which can lead to ID uniqueness violation.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership - The executeTransaction function allows any owner to execute a transaction without requiring multiple confirmations, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers.
