The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without reducing the voted amount, which can lead to an inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to cover the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an unfinished state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not properly defined in the contract, which can lead to issues with visibility and ownership control.
