Contract being analyzed:

contract VotingSystem {
     struct Proposal {
          uint256 startTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address proposer; 
          }
     address public owner;
     IERC20 public votingToken;
     mapping(address => uint256) public startingBalanceList;
     Proposal public currentProposal;

    function startVoting() public {
          uint256 startingBalance;
          require(currentProposal.startTime == 0, "Ongoing proposal exists");
          currentProposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
          startingBalance = getStartingBalance(currentProposal.proposer);
          startingBalanceList[currentProposal.proposer] = startingBalance; 
    }

    function vote(uint256 amount) public {
          require(currentProposal.startTime + 24 hours > block.timestamp, "Voting period ended");
          require(currentProposal.votedAmount == 0, "Already voted");
          votingToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
          currentProposal.votedAmount += amount; 
    }

    function endVoting() public {
          require(currentProposal.startTime != 0, "No active proposal");
          require(currentProposal.startTime + 24 hours < block.timestamp, "Voting period not ended");
          require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) * 2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "Voting failed");
    }
}

Output: 
- The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
  1) privilege escalation within the startVoting() function where any address can start a new proposal instead of only the owner.
  2) inconsistent state update in the endVoting() function where the condition for successful voting might not accurately reflect the state of the voting.
  3) atomicity violation in the vote() function where the transferFrom operation might not be complete before updating the votedAmount.
  4) insufficient gas in the endVoting() function where the gas required for the operation might not be enough leading to transaction failure.
