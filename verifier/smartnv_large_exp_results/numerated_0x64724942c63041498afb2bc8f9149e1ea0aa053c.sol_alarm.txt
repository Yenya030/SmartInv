The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The update of `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute` function could lead to inconsistent state due to the lack of proper synchronization or locking mechanisms.
2) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of the `execute` and `endExecute` functions are currently set to external, but they might need to be adjusted based on the intended access permissions.
3) Insufficient gas: The gas limit for executing the functions is not explicitly handled, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
