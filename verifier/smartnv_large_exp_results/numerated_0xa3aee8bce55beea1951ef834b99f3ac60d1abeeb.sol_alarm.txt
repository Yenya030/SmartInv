The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables "owner" and "votingToken" which can lead to potential issues with visibility and ownership control.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are inconsistencies in state updates, such as setting the proposal's starting balance without correctly initializing it, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The execution of certain functions, such as "endExecute", may require a significant amount of gas which can lead to out-of-gas errors and transaction failures.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
