Potential vulnerabilities in the Auction contract:
- Reentrancy: There is a possibility of reentrancy vulnerability in the bid function where the transfer of funds to the highestBidder is done before updating the highestBid and highestBidder variables. This can allow a malicious contract to call the bid function recursively before the variables are updated, potentially draining funds.
- Inconsistent state update: Depending on the order of execution of functions, there may be a scenario where the highestBidder is set but the highestBid value is not updated, leading to an inconsistent state.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check for integer overflow when updating the highestBid value. If the amount is very large, it could lead to an overflow issue.
