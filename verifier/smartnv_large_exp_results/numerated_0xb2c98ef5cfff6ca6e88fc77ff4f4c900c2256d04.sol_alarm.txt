The contract under analysis:

<\Contract\>
contract TokenSale {
    address public admin;
    IERC20 public token;
    address public wallet;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, address _wallet) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        wallet = _wallet;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) external {
        token.transferFrom(wallet, msg.sender, _amount);
    }

    function changeAdmin(address _newAdmin) external {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can call this function");
        admin = _newAdmin;
    }
}
<\Contract\>

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

- incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin can be changed by anyone externally, as there is no restriction on who can call the `changeAdmin` function. This can lead to privilege escalation if an unauthorized user changes the admin to gain control over the contract.

- inconsistent state update: The `buyTokens` function allows anyone to purchase tokens directly from the wallet without any checks or validations. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if the token balance and ownership are not properly managed during transactions.

- insufficient gas: If the `buyTokens` function requires a significant amount of gas to execute, there is a risk that users may not have enough gas to complete the transaction successfully, resulting in failed purchases.

- atomicity violation: The `buyTokens` function does not ensure atomicity in the token transfer process, which can result in partial or failed transfers if any step fails during the transaction.

- incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is set to public, potentially exposing sensitive information about the admin publicly on the blockchain.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
