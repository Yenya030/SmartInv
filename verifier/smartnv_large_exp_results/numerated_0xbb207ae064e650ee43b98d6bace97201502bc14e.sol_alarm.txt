1) Inconsistent state update: The contract lacks proper checks and updates after transferring tokens in the "execute" function, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to unintended access or modification by external contracts.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail due to insufficient gas if the execution of the require statement consumes more gas than the remaining gas limit.
