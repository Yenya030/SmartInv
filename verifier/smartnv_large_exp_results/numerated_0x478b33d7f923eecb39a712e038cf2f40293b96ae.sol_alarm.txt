The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) privilege escalation:
- The contract does not have access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.

2) inconsistent state update:
- The execution of the `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct without ensuring atomicity or synchronization.

3) ID uniqueness violation:
- The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposals which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The `owner` and `votingToken` variables are declared as `internal` which may expose them to unintended access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
