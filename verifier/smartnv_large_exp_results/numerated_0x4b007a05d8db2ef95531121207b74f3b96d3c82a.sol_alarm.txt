The potential vulnerabilities in the "VotingSystem" contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation: There could be issues if multiple voters have the same ID, leading to confusion or incorrect vote counting.
- Inconsistent state update: The state updates within the delegate and vote functions can lead to inconsistent data states and potentially incorrect voting results.
- Business logic flaw: There could be potential flaws in the logic of the delegate and vote functions that may allow for unexpected behavior or exploitation.
