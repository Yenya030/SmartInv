The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update:
   - The execute function modifies the state of the proposal by incrementing votedAmount without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas:
   - The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves a potentially large number of token transfers, which may require excessive gas and result in an out-of-gas error.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The owner variable is declared as internal, which might lead to incorrect visibility or ownership control issues.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
