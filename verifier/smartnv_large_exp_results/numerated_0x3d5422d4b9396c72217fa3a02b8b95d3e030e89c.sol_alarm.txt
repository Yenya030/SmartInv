The following contract may contain potential vulnerabilities:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
- In the function execute(), the addition operation proposal.votedAmount += amount; could potentially lead to an integer overflow if the votedAmount exceeds the maximum uint256 value.

2) Inconsistent state update:
- In the function endExecute(), the comparison require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed"); may not accurately reflect the total supply calculation due to inconsistency or race conditions in updating the balances.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The visibility of the internal owner address variable is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of this variable.
