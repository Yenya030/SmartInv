The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSale {
    address public admin;
    address public token;
    address public recipient;

    constructor(address _token, address _recipient) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        recipient = _recipient;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint256 amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == recipient, "only recipient can buy tokens");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function changeRecipient(address _newRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "only admin can change recipient");
        recipient = _newRecipient;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
3) business logic flaw: The buyTokens function allows any address to buy tokens as long as it matches the recipient address, which may lead to unauthorized purchases.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership: The changeRecipient function allows any address to change the recipient, not just the admin. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities are business logic flaw and incorrect visibility/ownership.
