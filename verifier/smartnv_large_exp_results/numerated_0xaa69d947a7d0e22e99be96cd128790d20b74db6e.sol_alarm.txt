Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure uniqueness of `proposal.addr` when assigning `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance`, which could lead to ID uniqueness violations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the `owner` variable is properly set or used within the contract, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
