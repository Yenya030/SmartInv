The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables sellerApproved, buyerApproved, and arbiterApproved can be manipulated in unexpected ways by the parties involved.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The approve function allows any party to change the approval status, which could lead to unauthorized changes in state.
3) Atomicity violation: The releaseFunds function may not atomically release the funds to the seller, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
4) Insufficient gas: Transferring funds in the releaseFunds and refundBuyer functions may run out of gas and cause the transactions to revert.
