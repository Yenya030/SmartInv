Contract Code:

contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint) public voteCount;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        voteCount[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address _newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
        admin = _newAdmin;
    }

    function getVoteCount(address _voter) public view returns(uint) {
        return voteCount[_voter];
    }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
