The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which may lead to unexpected access control issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state variables such as proposal and lockedFunds are updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can result in inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas provided to execute the required transfers and calculations.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculatePrice function if the divisor becomes zero, leading to unexpected results.
5) Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate function utilizes arithmetic operations that may result in incorrect calculations if not handled properly.
6) Ether leakage: There is a possibility of ether leakage in the contract if proper precautions are not taken to handle incoming Ether transfers.
