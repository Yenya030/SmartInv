The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` are not specified with any visibility modifier, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Uninitialized state: The variable `owner` is declared but not initialized, which may lead to unpredictable behavior.
4) Possible integer overflow: In the `liquidate` function, there is a calculation involving multiplication that may lead to an integer overflow.
5) Possible reentrancy vulnerability: The `liquidate` function transfers tokens before updating the state variables, which may allow for reentrancy attacks.
6) Insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice` function requires users to pay gas to execute it, which may lead to insufficient gas issues.
7) Possible Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions explicitly, which may lead to Ether leakage issues.
