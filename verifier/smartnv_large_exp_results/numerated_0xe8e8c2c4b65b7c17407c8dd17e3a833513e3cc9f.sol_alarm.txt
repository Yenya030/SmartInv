The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    uint public price;
    IERC20 public token;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) external {
        uint cost = amount * price;
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= cost, "Insufficient balance");
        
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, cost);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Arithmetic flaw: 
   - The multiplication operation in the `buyTokens` function could potentially result in an integer overflow if the amount and price are large enough.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The `owner` variable is declared as public, which exposes it to potential manipulation by any external contract or user.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The `buyTokens` function does not specify gas limits which could potentially lead to out of gas exceptions, especially if the contract operations are gas-intensive.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are arithmetic flaw, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
