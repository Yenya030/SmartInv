Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly incremented in the `execute` function without any checks or validation.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not correctly define the visibility intended for it. 

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas to execute if there are multiple transactions or a large number of stakeholders involved, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors. 

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that the `proposal` variable is unique, which can lead to conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.
