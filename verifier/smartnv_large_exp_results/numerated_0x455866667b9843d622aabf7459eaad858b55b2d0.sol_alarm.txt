The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct without checking if a proposal is already in progress, potentially leading to inconsistent states.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not provide the implementation for all the required functions, which could lead to issues in contract interoperability.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks if the execution has ended and if the balance is doubled but does not provide enough gas to execute these operations, leading to potential failure.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
