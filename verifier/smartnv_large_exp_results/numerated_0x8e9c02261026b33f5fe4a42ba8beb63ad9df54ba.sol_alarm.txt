The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple calls are made concurrently.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as public, which can reveal sensitive information about the token contract. Additionally, the `owner` variable is not being used or properly restricted in the functions, which may lead to ownership vulnerabilities.
