potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The contract contains functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute that update the state of the proposal struct. However, there is a lack of proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the state is updated atomically and consistently, which could lead to inconsistent data and potential vulnerabilities.

2) integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential risk of integer overflow in the execute function where the votedAmount is incremented without any overflow checks. This could result in unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities if the votedAmount exceeds the maximum uint256 value.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions, such as proposal and votingToken, is not specified in the contract. This could lead to accessibility issues and potentially allow unauthorized access or manipulation of critical data.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
