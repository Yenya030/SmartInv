This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement access control mechanisms, allowing any external address to call functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute.
2) Inconsistent state update: The variables proposal.votedAmount and lockedFunds are updated without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state within the contract.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions, which may lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.
