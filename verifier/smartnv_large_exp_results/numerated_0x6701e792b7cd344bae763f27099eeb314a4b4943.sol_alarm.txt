The contract you provided has potential vulnerabilities as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" without properly checking the state of the contract, which can lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "debt" and "collateral" mapping variables are publicly visible, which may expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
3) Insufficient gas: The "calculatePrice" function performs a complex operation (division) and returns a value without checking for sufficient gas, which can lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) Business logic flaw: The liquidation logic in the "liquidate" function may not accurately determine if a user's funds can be liquidated, potentially leading to incorrect liquidation actions. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
4) Business logic flaw
