The contract below may contain the following potential vulnerabilities: 

<\contract\>
contract TokenSale {
     IERC20 public token; 
     address public owner; 
     uint public tokenPrice;
     uint public availableTokens;

     constructor(address _token, uint _tokenPrice, uint _availableTokens) {
         token = IERC20(_token);
         owner = msg.sender;
         tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
         availableTokens = _availableTokens;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
         require(msg.value >= _numTokens * tokenPrice, "Insufficient funds");
         require(_numTokens <= availableTokens, "Not enough tokens available");
         token.transfer(msg.sender, _numTokens);
         owner.transfer(msg.value);
         availableTokens -= _numTokens;
     }

     function changeTokenPrice(uint _newPrice) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change token price");
         tokenPrice = _newPrice;
     }
}
<\contract\> 

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The changeTokenPrice function allows any caller to change the token price, instead of restricting this ability to only the owner.
2) Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function might fail if the gas provided by the user is not enough to cover the transaction costs.
3) Reentrancy: The buyTokens function transfers tokens before transferring the payment to the owner, potentially enabling a reentrancy attack.
4) Inconsistent state update: The availableTokens variable is updated after the tokens are transferred, which could lead to inconsistencies if the transfer fails.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are no checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow in the buyTokens function calculations.
