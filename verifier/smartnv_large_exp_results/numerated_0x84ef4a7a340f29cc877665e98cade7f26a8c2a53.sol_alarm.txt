The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract allows anyone to update the owner, which can lead to unauthorized privilege escalation if a malicious actor updates the owner address.
- Privilege escalation: The makePayment function, which should only be callable by the owner, does not have a proper access control check, allowing anyone to make payments on behalf of the owner.
