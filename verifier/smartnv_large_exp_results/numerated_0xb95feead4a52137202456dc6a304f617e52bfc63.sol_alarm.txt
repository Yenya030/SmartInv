The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function can be manipulated to lock funds inappropriately.
2) inconsistent state update: There are multiple occurrences where state variables are updated without proper synchronization or checks.
3) atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not atomic, which can lead to unexpected results if the function is interrupted.
4) insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution, especially in the `execute` function where token transfers are involved.
