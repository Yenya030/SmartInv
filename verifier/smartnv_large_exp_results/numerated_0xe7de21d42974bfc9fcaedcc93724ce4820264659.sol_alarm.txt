Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, `lockedFunds` are all declared with insufficient visibility (internal or private) which may expose sensitive information and allow unauthorized access.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state is being updated in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent data states.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow, such as in the `calculatePrice` function in the `pair` contract.
4) Atomicity violation: Operations in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions are not atomic, where multiple state changes are made without proper atomicity checks.
5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limitations or out-of-gas scenarios which could result in failed transactions or stalled execution.
