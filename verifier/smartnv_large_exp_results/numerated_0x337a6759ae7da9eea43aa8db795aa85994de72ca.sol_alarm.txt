Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: the `initialize` function can be called by any address, allowing potential unauthorized parties to set the seller and price.
- Insufficient gas: when transferring the payment to the seller, if the seller's contract requires a significant amount of gas to execute, the transfer might fail due to running out of gas.
- Ether leakage: if the seller address is a contract address and does not have a withdrawal function, the transferred ether could be locked in the contract forever.
