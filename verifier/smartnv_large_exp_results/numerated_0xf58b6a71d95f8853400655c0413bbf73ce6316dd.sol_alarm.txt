The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable 'lockedFunds' is updated in the 'endExecute' function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not properly enforce the visibility of functions defined in the interface, which could potentially lead to incorrect function visibility and ownership concerns.
