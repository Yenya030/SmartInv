The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow when calculating the total cost of tokens to be bought.
2) Insufficient gas: If the token balance or allowance check requires a lot of gas, it may lead to out-of-gas exceptions.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is public, which may expose sensitive information about the contract owner.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the given contract are integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
