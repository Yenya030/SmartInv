Contract you are going to analyze:
contract VestingContract {
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public startTime;
    uint public duration;
    uint public totalAmount;
    uint public amountClaimed;

    function claim() public {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "only beneficiary can claim");
        require(block.timestamp >= startTime, "vesting period has not started yet");

        uint elapsedTime = block.timestamp - startTime;
        uint vestingAmount = (totalAmount * elapsedTime) / duration;
        uint claimableAmount = vestingAmount - amountClaimed;

        require(claimableAmount > 0, "no funds available for claiming");
        
        amountClaimed += claimableAmount;
        beneficiary.transfer(claimableAmount);
    }
}
