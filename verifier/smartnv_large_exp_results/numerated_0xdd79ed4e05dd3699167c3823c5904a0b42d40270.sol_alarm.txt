Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated within the same function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not atomic, which can potentially lead to unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails mid-execution.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially costly operation by checking if the locked funds are more than half of the total supply without considering the gas limit, which could result in running out of gas.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear whether the owner variable is meant to be public or if there should be a specific access control mechanism in place to restrict access to certain functions.
