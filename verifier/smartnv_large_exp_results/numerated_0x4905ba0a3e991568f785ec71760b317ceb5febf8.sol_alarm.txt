Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple instances where arithmetic operations are performed without proper checks for overflow/underflow, such as in the function `liquidate` of example 2. 
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation.
4) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized users to call critical functions like `execute`.
5) Insufficient gas: Depending on the contract's complexity and gas requirements, there might be a risk of insufficient gas provided for certain operations, leading to failed transactions or unexpected behavior.
