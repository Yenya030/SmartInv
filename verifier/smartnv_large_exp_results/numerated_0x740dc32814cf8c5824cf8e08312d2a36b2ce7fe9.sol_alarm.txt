Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

8) Reentrancy: The contract is transferring tokens in the execute function without using the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which can leave it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

5) Atomicity violation: There is a potential atomicity violation in the endExecute function where multiple state updates are done without proper synchronization, leaving the contract open to inconsistent state updates.

13) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a significant amount of gas to execute if the votingToken balance is high, potentially leading to insufficient gas issues.

11) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have a self-destruct mechanism, but if added in the future without proper precautions, it could result in the contract becoming a suicidal contract.
