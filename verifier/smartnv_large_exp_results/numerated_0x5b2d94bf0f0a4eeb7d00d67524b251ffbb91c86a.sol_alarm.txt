The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization or validation, which may lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is being accessed by external functions without proper access control or visibility modifiers, which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
