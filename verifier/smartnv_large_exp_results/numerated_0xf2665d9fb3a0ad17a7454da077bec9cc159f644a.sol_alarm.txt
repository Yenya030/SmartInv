The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The contract does not have proper synchronization mechanisms for updating the state of the proposal in functions like `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute`, which could lead to inconsistent data state.

2) ID uniqueness violation:
- There is potential for ID uniqueness violations if the `proposal` struct does not guarantee unique identifiers for each proposal.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The contract does not account for potential out-of-gas errors that could occur during execution, especially in functions like `endExecute` where gas consumption may vary based on external factors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- ID uniqueness violation
- Insufficient gas
