Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or confusion.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates happening in the startExecute function without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of functions and variables, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.
4) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of functions due to extensive computations or loop iterations.
5) Business logic flaw: The requirement for execution in the endExecute function may not accurately reflect the intended behavior, leading to incorrect outcomes.
