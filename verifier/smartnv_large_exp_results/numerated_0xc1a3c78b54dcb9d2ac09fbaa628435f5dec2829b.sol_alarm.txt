The contract in question contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not provide implementations for the required functions of the interface. 

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field of the `proposal` struct, but there is no mechanism to ensure atomicity of this operation.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a check that could potentially consume a large amount of gas, leading to out-of-gas errors.

4) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute` function may allow for funds to be locked indefinitely, depending on the state of the contract and the tokens involved.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not show any mechanisms to ensure uniqueness of IDs or addresses used within its functions.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions in a secure manner, which may lead to Ether leakage. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, Insufficient gas, Business logic flaw, ID uniqueness violation, and Ether leakage.
