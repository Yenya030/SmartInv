The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Privilege escalation in the `updateRecipient` function where anyone can change the recipient address.
2) Inconsistent state update as the recipient can be changed without proper authorization.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership as the `recipient` address can be changed by anyone calling the function.
4) Insufficient gas as the `makePayment` function doesn't specify a gas limit for the token transfer operation.
