Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Privilege escalation: The contract allows the 'startExecute' function to be called externally, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation if the function is not properly secured.
- Inconsistent state update: The 'execute' function updates the 'proposal.votedAmount' without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is no explicit check for potential integer overflow or underflow in the calculations involving 'proposal.votedAmount'.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not specified, which could lead to incorrect access control or ownership issues.
