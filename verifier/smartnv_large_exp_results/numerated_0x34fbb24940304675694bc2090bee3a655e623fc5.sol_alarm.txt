Note: The contract below is missing some parts for a comprehensive analysis.

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid not high enough");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only highest bidder can withdraw");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBid = 0;
    }
}
