Contract to be analyzed:
contract TokenSale {
          address public admin;
          IERC20 public token;
          address public recipient;
          uint public tokenPrice;
          uint public totalTokens;

          constructor(address _token, address _recipient, uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) {
              admin = msg.sender;
              token = IERC20(_token);
              recipient = _recipient;
              tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
              totalTokens = _totalTokens;
          }

          function buyTokens(uint _tokens) public {
              require(msg.value == _tokens * tokenPrice, "Insufficient payment");
              require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _tokens, "Not enough tokens in the contract");
              token.transfer(msg.sender, _tokens);
          }

          function endSale() public {
              require(msg.sender == admin, "Unauthorized access");
              token.transfer(recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
