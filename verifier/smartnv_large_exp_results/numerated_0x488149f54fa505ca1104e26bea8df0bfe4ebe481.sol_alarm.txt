The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            address payable prevHighestBidder = address(uint160(highestBidder));
            prevHighestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBid = 0;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Reentrancy: The `bid()` function transfers funds to the previous highest bidder before updating the highest bidder and highest bid. This sequence of operations can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the highest bidder and highest bid after transferring funds to the previous highest bidder. This may lead to inconsistent state if the transfer fails after updating the highest bidder and highest bid.
3) Avoid using address(uint160()) for typecasting as it may lead to vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are reentrancy and inconsistent state update.
