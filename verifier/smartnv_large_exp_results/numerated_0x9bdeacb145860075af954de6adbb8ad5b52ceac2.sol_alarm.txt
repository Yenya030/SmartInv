Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract might be vulnerable to inconsistent state update as the proposal's votedAmount is being updated directly in the execute function without any check to ensure that this operation is atomic.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract doesn't specify the visibility of the proposal variable, which could lead to issues with ownership and access control.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a complex operation of checking the balance and transferring tokens, which might require more gas than the block gas limit allows, potentially resulting in insufficient gas error.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are several arithmetic operations in the contract that involve addition and subtraction, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.
