The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute()` function but it is not clear how this information is being used or managed. This could lead to an inconsistent state within the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but it is not clear if the necessary functions such as `transfer` and `balanceOf` are properly implemented or not. This could result in incorrect visibility or ownership of tokens within the contract.
