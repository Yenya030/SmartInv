The contract provided for analysis contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct without ensuring that the state changes are done atomically. This could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions attempt to update the proposal simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function performs a gas-intensive operation of checking if the locked funds are greater than half of the total token supply. If the contract runs out of gas during this check, it could lead to the incomplete execution of the function and potential issues.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the owner variable, making it susceptible to potential unauthorized access or modification by external contracts.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
