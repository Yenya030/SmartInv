Contract you are analyzing:
contract Market {
         uint public price;
         
         function setPrice(uint _price) public {
             price = _price;
         }
         
         function buy() public payable {
             require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient funds to purchase");
             // perform buying logic
         }
         
         function sell(uint _amount) public {
             require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
             // perform selling logic
         }
     } 

Output: 
- Arithmetic flaw (potential underflow in sell function)
- Insufficient gas (if the logic inside buy or sell functions consume too much gas)
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (functions are public, consider if they should be restricted to certain users)
