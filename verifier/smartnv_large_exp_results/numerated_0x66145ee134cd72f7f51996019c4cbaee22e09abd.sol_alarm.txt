The contract at hand contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'execute' function updates the 'proposal.votedAmount' variable without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas cost of the operations, there might be a risk of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, leading to incomplete transactions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions is not specified explicitly, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
