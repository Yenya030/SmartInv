The contract you provided has the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract has functions that can be accessed by external users to start, execute, and end proposals. There could be a risk of privilege escalation if proper access control mechanisms are not implemented.

2) inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` state variable by adding the `amount` to `proposal.votedAmount`. However, it does not check if the transfer of tokens is successful before updating the state. This could lead to an inconsistent state if the token transfer fails.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` state variable is declared as an internal variable, which makes it only accessible within the contract and its derived contracts. If this variable should be accessed externally, the visibility should be adjusted accordingly.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to privilege escalation, inconsistent state updates, and incorrect visibility/ownership issues.
