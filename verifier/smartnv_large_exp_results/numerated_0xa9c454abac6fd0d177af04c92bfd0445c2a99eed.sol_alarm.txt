The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without checking if the execution was successful or not, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The "execute" function transfers tokens without setting a gas limit, which could result in the transaction running out of gas before completing the transfer.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the "proposal" struct and the "votedProposal" function, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities related to visibility and ownership.
