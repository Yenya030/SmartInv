The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the state variable "proposal.votedAmount" without ensuring that the proposal is still ongoing, which could lead to incorrect state management.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "endExecute" function updates the state variable "lockedFunds" without specifying the visibility (public, internal, private) of the variable, which could lead to potential issues with contract readability and access control.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks for a condition that requires a substantial amount of gas to execute, which could potentially lead to out of gas error during contract execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
