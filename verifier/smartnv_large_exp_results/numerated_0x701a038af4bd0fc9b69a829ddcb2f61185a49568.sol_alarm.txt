The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which might allow unauthorized access to critical functions or data.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
