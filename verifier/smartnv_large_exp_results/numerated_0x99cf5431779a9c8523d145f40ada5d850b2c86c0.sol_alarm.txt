The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the voting transaction was successful, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if the transfer fails.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList`, which can lead to potential security risks.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` checks for a condition that requires significant gas by calculating the balance of the contract and the total supply, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas issues.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve integer calculations, such as in the `calculatePrice` function, which could be vulnerable to overflow or underflow issues if not handled properly.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and integer overflow/underflow.
