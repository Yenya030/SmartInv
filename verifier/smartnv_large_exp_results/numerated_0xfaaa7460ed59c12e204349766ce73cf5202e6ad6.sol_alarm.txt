Contract TimelockController contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the proposal struct, which could lead to unexpected behavior or access control issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
