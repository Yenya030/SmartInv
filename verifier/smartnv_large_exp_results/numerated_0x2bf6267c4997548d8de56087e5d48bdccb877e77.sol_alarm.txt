The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without a proper check or restriction, which could lead to inconsistent data state.
2) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of the `votedProposal` function is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit provided for executing functions is not enough, it could lead to incomplete or failed transactions.
