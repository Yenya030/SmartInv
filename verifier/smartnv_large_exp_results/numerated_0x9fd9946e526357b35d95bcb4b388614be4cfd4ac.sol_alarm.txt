There are potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided. 

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the `startExecute` function to be called externally, which could potentially lead to unauthorized parties initiating the execution process.

2) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than twice the total supply of the token before unlocking the funds, which may not be the intended logic for determining the success of execution.

3) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without any checks on potential overflows or underflows, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal but is not used in the provided code snippet. This could lead to confusion about ownership and visibility control in the contract.
