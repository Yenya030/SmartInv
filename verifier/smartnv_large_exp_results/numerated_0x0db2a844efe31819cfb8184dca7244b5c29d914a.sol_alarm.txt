1) Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The function endVoting doesn't restrict the access properly, allowing anyone to call it and potentially manipulate the final result.

Therefore, the potential vulnerability in the contract is incorrect visibility/ownership.
