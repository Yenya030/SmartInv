The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the proposal struct without using a proper locking mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal owner variable is not explicitly defined as private, making it accessible externally.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the required operations, leading to possible denial of service.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or errors.
5) Privilege escalation: The lack of proper access control mechanisms or roles can lead to privilege escalation attacks.
6) Arithmetic flaw: There are arithmetic calculations in the contract that may be subject to overflow or underflow vulnerabilities if not properly handled.
