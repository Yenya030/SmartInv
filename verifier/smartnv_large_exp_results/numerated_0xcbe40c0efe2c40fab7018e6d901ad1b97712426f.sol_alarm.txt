The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` struct, `votingToken`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, leaving them potentially accessible in unintended ways.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function without considering potential concurrent calls or checks, leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Atomicity violation: The update of `proposal.votedAmount` and the call to `votedProposal` are not enclosed in a single atomic operation, potentially leading to incomplete or inconsistent data updates.
- Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a balance check that could consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors if the balance of `address(this)` is too high.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no guarantee of uniqueness for the `proposal` struct, which may lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are created simultaneously with the same attributes.
