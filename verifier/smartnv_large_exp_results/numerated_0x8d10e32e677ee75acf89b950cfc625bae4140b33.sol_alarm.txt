The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract and the total supply of the token, which may require excessive gas and could potentially fail due to running out of gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal` instead of `private`, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the owner variable.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
