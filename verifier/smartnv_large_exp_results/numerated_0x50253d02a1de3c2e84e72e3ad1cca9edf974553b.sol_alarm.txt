The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly without considering potential race conditions.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not define all the necessary functions, which may lead to ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function might require an excessive amount of gas if there are a large number of tokens to transfer.

4) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might not accurately represent the intended business logic.
