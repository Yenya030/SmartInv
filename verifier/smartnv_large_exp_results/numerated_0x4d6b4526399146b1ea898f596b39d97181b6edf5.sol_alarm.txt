The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows any user to call the `endExecute` function and potentially lock the funds if the conditions are met, which could lead to privilege escalation.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field of the `Proposal` struct, but the checked condition for this field being zero is done before the update. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract against the total supply of the token, which could require a large amount of gas to execute and potentially fail due to insufficient gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
