The contract to be analyzed is:

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;
    
    function swapTokens(address _recipient, uint _amountA, uint _amountB) public {
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amountA);
        tokenB.transferFrom(_recipient, address(this), _amountB);
        
        tokenA.transfer(_recipient, _amountB);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, _amountA);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The transfer of tokens in the swapTokens function is not done in an atomic manner, which may lead to inconsistent state if one of the transfers fails.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The transferFrom function should check the ownership of the tokens being transferred to prevent unauthorized transfers.
