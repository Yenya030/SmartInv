Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" statement in the execute function updates the state variable without using proper synchronization methods, which may lead to data inconsistency.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The use of a single proposal struct in the TimelockController contract without unique identifiers for each proposal may lead to ID uniqueness violation and confusion in tracking multiple proposals.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if it consumes too much gas due to the require statement "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");", which may result in insufficient gas for the execution.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the internal owner variable in the TimelockController contract is not specified, which may lead to potential issues related to ownership and accessibility.
