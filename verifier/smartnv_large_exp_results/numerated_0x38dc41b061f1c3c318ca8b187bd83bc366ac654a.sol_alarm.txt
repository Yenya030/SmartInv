The contract you provided is <\example_1\>. 

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variables proposal.sTime and startingBalanceList are being updated in the startExecute function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not define the required ERC20 functions or state variables, which may lead to ownership and visibility issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in this contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
