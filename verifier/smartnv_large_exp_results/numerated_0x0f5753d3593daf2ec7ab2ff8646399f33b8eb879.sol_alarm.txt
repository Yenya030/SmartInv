contract Escrow {
         address public buyer;
         address public seller;
         address public arbiter;
         uint256 public escrowAmount;

         constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint256 _amount) {
             buyer = _buyer;
             seller = _seller;
             arbiter = _arbiter;
             escrowAmount = _amount;
         }

         function releaseAmountToSeller() public {
             require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
             seller.transfer(escrowAmount);
         }

         function refundAmountToBuyer() public {
             require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund funds");
             buyer.transfer(escrowAmount);
         }

         function depositFunds() public payable {
             require(msg.value == escrowAmount, "Deposit amount must match escrow amount");
         }
     }

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract Escrow are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseAmountToSeller and refundAmountToBuyer functions only check if the caller is the arbiter, but they should also ensure that the caller is buyer or seller respectively.
2) Insufficient gas: The transfer function used to release or refund funds might fail if the gas stipend is not enough for the receiver to handle the funds.
3) Atomicity violation: The depositFunds function does not update any state variables in an atomic manner, which could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state updates.
