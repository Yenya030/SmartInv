Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the proposal state without checking for existing proposals, potentially allowing for multiple proposals to be initiated at the same time.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which means it can be accessed by child contracts. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the votingToken.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier, which may lead to confusion or conflicts when processing multiple proposals simultaneously.
