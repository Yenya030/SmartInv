Potential vulnerabilities:
- Reentrancy: The transfer function is called before updating the highestBidder and highestBid variables, which could allow a malicious bidder to call placeBid recursively and drain funds.
- Inconsistent state update: The order in which the highestBidder and highestBid variables are updated could lead to inconsistent state if an error occurs after updating one but before the other.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check for potential integer overflow or underflow when updating the highestBid variable.
