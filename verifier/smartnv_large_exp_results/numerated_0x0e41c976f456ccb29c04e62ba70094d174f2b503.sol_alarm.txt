The contract below has potential vulnerabilities:

contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint256) public payments;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function makePayment() public payable {
        payments[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawPayment() public {
        require(payments[msg.sender] > 0, "No payments to withdraw");
        uint256 payment = payments[msg.sender];
        payments[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(payment);
    }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The admin variable is public, which exposes it to potential privilege escalation attacks.
- Ether Leakage: The makePayment function allows users to send ether directly to the contract without specifying a purpose or receiving anything in return, which may lead to ether being stuck in the contract.
- Insufficient Gas: The withdrawPayment function uses transfer to send ether to the caller, which may not provide enough gas for certain scenarios, leading to the transaction failing and the funds being locked in the contract.
