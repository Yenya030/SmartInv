The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function in the TimelockController contract updates the votedAmount field in the proposal struct without properly checking for reentrancy or ensuring atomicity of the operation.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for an integer overflow/underflow in the liquidate function of the ExchangeTokens contract if the calculation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) results in a value that exceeds the maximum or minimum integer size.
