<\contract_3\> 

The potential vulnerabilities in <\contract_3\> are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `hasVoted` function allows anyone to view if a specific user has voted, potentially exposing private information. Visibility should be controlled based on the requirements of the application.
- Inconsistent state update: The `delegate` function updates the `voted` status of the sender without ensuring that the `hasVoted` function accurately reflects this change, leading to inconsistencies in the contract state.
