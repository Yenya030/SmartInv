Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, such as totalSupply, which could lead to incorrect behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state variables proposal.votedAmount and calls votedProposal(proposal) in separate steps, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if an error occurs between the two.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if the gas provided is not enough to cover the execution, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could result in conflicting data or unexpected behavior.
