Contract you are going to analyze:
contract TokenSale {
    address public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, allowing anyone to view and potentially change the owner of the contract.
- Inconsistent state update: The price variable is set in the constructor, but there is no function provided to update the price later on, leading to inconsistent state if the price needs to be changed.
- Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function may fail if the amount of gas provided is not enough to complete the transfer of tokens to the buyer.
- Atomicity violation: The buyTokens function involves multiple external calls (require, transfer) which may result in a situation where the state is not atomic, leading to unexpected behavior.
