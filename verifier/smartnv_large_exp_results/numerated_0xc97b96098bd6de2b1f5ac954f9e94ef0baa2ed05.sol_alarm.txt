The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal without ensuring that the transfer of tokens is successful. This can lead to an inconsistent state if the transfer fails after updating the proposal.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may require a significant amount of gas to execute if there are a large number of voters. This could potentially lead to an out-of-gas error and prevent the function from completing successfully.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables proposal and votingToken, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external contracts.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculation within the liquidate() function if the result exceeds the maximum value that uint can hold. Additionally, there is a division operation in the calculatePrice() function that may result in an integer divide-by-zero error.
