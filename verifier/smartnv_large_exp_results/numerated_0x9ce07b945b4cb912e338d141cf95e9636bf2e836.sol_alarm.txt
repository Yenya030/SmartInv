Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the state variable lockedFunds based on the current balance of the contract, which can be manipulated by external factors leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20, but it does not have the required functions and variables defined in the interface, potentially causing issues with compatibility and ownership.
