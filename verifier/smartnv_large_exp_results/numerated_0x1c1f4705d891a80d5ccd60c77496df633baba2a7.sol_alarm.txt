Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, but it does not properly account for any changes in the balance that could occur before the function completes execution, leading to an inconsistent state update.

2) Insufficient gas: There is a potential for the contract to run out of gas during the execution of functions, especially if there are multiple transfer operations or if the contract needs to perform complex calculations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of certain variables or functions is not properly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical contract functionalities.

4) Privilege escalation: The contract does not properly handle permissions or access control, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute functions or access sensitive information.
