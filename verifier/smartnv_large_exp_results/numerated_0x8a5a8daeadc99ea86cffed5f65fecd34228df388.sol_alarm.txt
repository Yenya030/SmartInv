The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) No check for over-refunding in the refund function.
2) Lack of validation for the amount transferred in releaseFunds and refund functions.
3) The `price` of the transaction is publicly accessible, which can potentially lead to price manipulation.
4) No check for sufficient gas in transfer functions.
5) Lack of proper access control in state transitions.
6) Lack of input validation for the constructor parameters.
