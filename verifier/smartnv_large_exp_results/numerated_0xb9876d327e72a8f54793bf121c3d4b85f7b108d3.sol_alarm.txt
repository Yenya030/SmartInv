The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the struct Proposal, which could potentially lead to visibility issues and may not be intended.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses proposal.votedAmount += amount, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple executions are processed concurrently.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The code does not implement a mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to issues with identifying and tracking different proposals accurately.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a high amount of gas to execute, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
5) Atomicity violation: The execute() function involves multiple state-changing operations without using a mechanism like locking to ensure atomicity, which could lead to unforeseen issues if some operations fail midway.
6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions in a way that prevents unintended loss of ether.
7) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include a mechanism to prevent actions that could result in the contract becoming non-operational (e.g., self-destruct).
8) Cross-bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with different tokens (votingToken, WETH, USDC) without ensuring consistency in how these tokens are handled, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
