The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "startingBlance" is being set in the startExecute function but is misspelled, potentially leading to unintended behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the owner variable is used for any specific purpose, and its visibility is set to internal, which could lead to ownership-related issues.
3) Integer overflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculations involving votedAmount and possibly in other parts of the contract.
4) Insufficient gas: The execution of transactions might fail due to insufficient gas provided for certain operations.
5) Ethereum leakage: There is a possibility of Ethereum being leaked due to incorrect handling of token transfers or balances in the contract.
