Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables votingToken and startingBalanceList are declared without any visibility specifier, which could lead to potential issues in terms of access control.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs multiple operations that involve external calls, such as balanceOf and transferFrom, which may require a significant amount of gas. If the gas limit is not set appropriately, the function may fail due to insufficient gas.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple mathematical operations in the contract, such as addition and multiplication, which could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.
