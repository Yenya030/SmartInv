The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without any proper synchronization or atomic operations, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not define all the functions required by the interface. This can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
