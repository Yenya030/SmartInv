The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the `proposal` struct for tracking proposals, but the `startExecute` function allows for overwriting an existing proposal without proper checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not declared in the contract, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership control issues.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve adding to `proposal.votedAmount`, which could potentially result in integer overflow if not properly handled.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function requires checking the balance of `address(this)` against `votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may require excessive gas and could potentially lead to out-of-gas exceptions.
