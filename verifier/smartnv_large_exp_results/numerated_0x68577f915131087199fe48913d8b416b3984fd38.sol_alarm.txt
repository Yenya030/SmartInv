The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly with `proposal.votedAmount += amount` without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistencies in the state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `lockedFunds` variables are not specified with a visibility keyword, which can lead to potential visibility and ownership issues. 

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function performs a gas-heavy operation with the `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` check, which may lead to out-of-gas exceptions.
