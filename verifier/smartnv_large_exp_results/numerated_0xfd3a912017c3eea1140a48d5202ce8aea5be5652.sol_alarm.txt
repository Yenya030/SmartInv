The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract updates the `debt` and `collateral` mappings without checking for proper synchronization or consistency between the values, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract contains an arithmetic calculation (`getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`) that could potentially result in arithmetic flaws if the inputs are not properly validated or sanitized.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and arithmetic flaw.
