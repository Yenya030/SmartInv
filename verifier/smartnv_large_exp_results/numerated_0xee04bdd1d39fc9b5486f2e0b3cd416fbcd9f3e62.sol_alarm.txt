The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function based on the balance of the `votingToken`, which may not accurately reflect the final state due to concurrent transactions. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The `votedProposal` function is called after updating `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function, which could lead to a race condition and atomicity violation.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which could lead to potential visibility issues.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
