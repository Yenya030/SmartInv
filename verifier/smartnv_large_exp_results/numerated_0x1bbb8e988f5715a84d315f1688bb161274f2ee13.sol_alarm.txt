The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public recipient;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;
    bool public released;
    bool public refunded;

    constructor(address _payer, address _recipient, address _arbiter, uint _amount){
        payer = _payer;
        recipient = _recipient;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = _amount;
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == payer || msg.sender == recipient || msg.sender == arbiter);
        require(!released);
        
        recipient.transfer(amount);
        released = true;
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == payer || msg.sender == arbiter);
        require(!refunded);
        
        payer.transfer(amount);
        refunded = true;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership in the release and refund functions.
