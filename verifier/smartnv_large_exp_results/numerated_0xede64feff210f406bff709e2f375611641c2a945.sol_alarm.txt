Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the contract, allowing any user to call the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas to complete the transfer and update operations, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions in the contract may not be properly set, leading to potential security vulnerabilities related to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract data.
