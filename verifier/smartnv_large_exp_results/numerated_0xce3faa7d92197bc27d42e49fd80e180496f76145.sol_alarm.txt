Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to a situation where multiple proposals have the same ID.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function without consideration for potential reentrancy issues or race conditions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `proposal` variable and `startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute` functions, which could lead to unexpected access control issues. 

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` consumes a large amount of gas, potentially preventing the function from completing successfully.

5) Business logic flaw: The conditions in the `endExecute` function may not accurately determine if the execution should proceed, leading to unintended consequences.
