The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract Auction {
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function placeBid(uint _bidAmount) public {
        require(_bidAmount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
        if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
            bids[highestBidder] += highestBid;
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = _bidAmount;
    }

    function withdrawBid() public {
        require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Cannot withdraw while being the highest bidder");
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership

This contract does not restrict the access to `highestBidder` and `highestBid` which are sensitive variables.

2) Atomicity violation

There is a possibility of an atomicity violation in the `placeBid` function as bids are being updated in multiple steps without a lock.

3) Inconsistent state update

The `withdrawBid` function allows any user to set their bid to zero, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

4) Reentrancy

There is a potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `placeBid` function, as the bids for the previous highest bidder are updated after setting the new highest bidder, allowing for reentrant calls to the contract.

5) Insufficient gas

If the contract runs out of gas during the execution of `placeBid`, it may lead to incomplete updates and potential vulnerabilities.
