In the contract provided, the following potential vulnerabilities are identified:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))`) without checking for any re-entrancy vulnerabilities.
   
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function contains multiple state-changing operations (`votingToken.transferFrom`, incrementing `proposal.votedAmount`, and calling `votedProposal`) without utilizing any locking mechanisms to ensure atomicity.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate` function if the input values lead to multiplication exceeding the maximum value of the data type.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, defaulting to internal visibility, which may not be the intended behavior for the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
