This contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- In the execute function, incrementing proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization mechanisms may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to execute the function simultaneously.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The owner variable is declared as internal, which may expose ownership control to unintended contracts or actors. Consider making it private or implementing proper access control.

3) Insufficient gas: 
- The endExecute function may fail if the gas limit is exceeded during execution due to the requirement of checking the balance of the address(this) against the total supply.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
