This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal` is not properly initialized in the `execute` function, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which might expose ownership information to external contracts or parties.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function uses a loop that calls `votedProposal(proposal)` which might consume a lot of gas and exceed the block gas limit.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
