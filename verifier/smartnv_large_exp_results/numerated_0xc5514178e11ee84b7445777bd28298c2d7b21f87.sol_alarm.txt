The vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The potential vulnerability lies in the endExecute function where the condition for checking the execution failure is based on the total balance of tokens held in the contract, rather than the actual proposal amount. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not properly define the required functions. This could lead to incorrect visibility and ownership issues.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
