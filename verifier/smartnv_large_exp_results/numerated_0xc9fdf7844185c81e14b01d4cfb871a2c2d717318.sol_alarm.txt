<\output\>
- Inconsistent state update: The endProposal function allows for the deletion of a proposal without checking for any conditions or restrictions, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: If the endProposal function requires a considerable amount of gas to execute, there might be insufficient gas provided by the user, leading to the function failing to execute completely.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is publicly accessible, which could potentially lead to unauthorized changes to the contract state.
