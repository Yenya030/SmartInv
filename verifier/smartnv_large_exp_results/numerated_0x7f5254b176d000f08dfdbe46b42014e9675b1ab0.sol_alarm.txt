The contract provided for analysis:

contract Auction {
    uint public highestBid;
    address public highestBidder;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid); 
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;

    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Auction contract are:
1) Reentrancy
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Integer underflow
