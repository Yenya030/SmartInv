The contract given for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) external {
        uint totalCost = amount * price;
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, amount);
        payable(owner).transfer(totalCost);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract include: 
2) price manipulation
