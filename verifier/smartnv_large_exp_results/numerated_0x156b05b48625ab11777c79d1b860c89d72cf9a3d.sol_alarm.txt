potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) business logic flaw: The function execute() does not properly check if the proposal has been fully executed before allowing additional transfers. This could lead to reentrancy attacks or inconsistent state updates.
2) inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable based on the total balance of the contract, which may not accurately reflect the intended state of the contract.
3) atomicity violation: Multiple operations are being performed within the execute() function without using a locking mechanism to ensure atomicity, potentially leading to race conditions.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify proper visibility for the internal owner variable, potentially leading to security issues related to ownership control.
