Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if `proposal.sTime` is already set, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may fail to execute if the gas limit is too low, as it checks if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` which may consume a considerable amount of gas if the token supply is large.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, which could lead to potential accessibility issues. Additionally, there is no explicit ownership control defined for the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
