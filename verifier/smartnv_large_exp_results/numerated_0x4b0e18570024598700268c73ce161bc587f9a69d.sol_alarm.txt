Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization. This can lead to inconsistent data if multiple transactions try to update `votedAmount` simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as private, making its data accessible externally. This may expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
