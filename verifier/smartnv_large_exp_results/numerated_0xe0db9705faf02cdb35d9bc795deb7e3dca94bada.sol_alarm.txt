Contract to analyze: 

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public price;
    bool public releasedToSeller;
    bool public releasedToBuyer;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _price) public {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        price = _price;
        releasedToSeller = false;
        releasedToBuyer = false;
    }

    function releaseToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can release funds");
        require(!releasedToSeller, "Funds already released to seller");
        releasedToSeller = true;
        seller.transfer(price);
    }

    function releaseToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can release funds");
        require(!releasedToBuyer, "Funds already released to buyer");
        releasedToBuyer = true;
        buyer.transfer(price);
    }

    function refundToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can refund funds");
        require(!releasedToBuyer, "Funds already released to buyer");
        releasedToBuyer = true;
        buyer.transfer(price);
    }
}
