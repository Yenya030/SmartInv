Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state, but it does not initialize the `proposal` variable before doing so, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is called in the `execute` function without being defined in the contract, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is more than double the total supply of the voting token, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas and result in an out-of-gas exception.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
