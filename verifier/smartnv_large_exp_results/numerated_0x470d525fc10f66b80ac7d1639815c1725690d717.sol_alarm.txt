The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring that it is correctly synchronized with the other variables and contract state. This can lead to inconsistent state and potential issues.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate` function of the `ExchangeTokens` contract, there is a potential arithmetic flaw in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`. Depending on the values of these variables, there could be an arithmetic overflow or underflow issue.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Arithmetic flaw
