The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The function liquidate in ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as it does not check for sufficient collateral before transferring funds.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates as it updates the debt and collateral mappings without proper validation and verification.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables in the contract are not explicitly defined, which could lead to potential security risks.
