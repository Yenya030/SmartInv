Potential vulnerabilities:
1) No check for integer overflow/underflow when updating product details.
2) Lack of access control, allowing anyone to buy a product on behalf of the owner.
3) Lack of atomicity in the buyProduct function, as the balance transfer and product owner update are not performed atomically.
4) No check for inconsistent state update when marking a product as sold.
5) Insufficient gas for potential revert in the buyProduct function.
6) Incorrect visibility for the products mapping, making it publicly accessible.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- integer overflow/underflow
- insufficient gas
- incorrect visibility/ownership
