Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation bug: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling critical functions.
2) Business logic flaw: The liquidation logic in the function "liquidate" may have a flaw as it could lead to unexpected behavior during liquidation process.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential risk of integer overflow/underflow in the calculation of the liquidation amount when converting different token values.
4) Inconsistent state update: There might be inconsistencies in updating the debt and collateral values for a specific user during the liquidation process.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables or functions may be incorrect, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access.
