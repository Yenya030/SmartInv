The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have inconsistent state updates if multiple users interact with it simultaneously.

2) Atomicity violation: The contract operations are not atomic, which may lead to unexpected behavior if multiple operations are not completed successfully.

3) Ether leakage: There are no checks to prevent ether leakage, which may lead to unintended loss of funds.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables may not be properly defined, leading to potential security risks.
