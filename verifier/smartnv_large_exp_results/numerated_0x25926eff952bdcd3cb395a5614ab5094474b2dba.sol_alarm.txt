The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract's token holdings. However, this update does not consider potential changes in the token balance after the check, leading to a possible inconsistency.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes, such as transferring tokens and updating the `votedAmount` in the proposal. Without proper synchronization or atomicity guarantees, this could lead to inconsistent state updates if any of the operations fail.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function relies on checking the balance of the contract's token holdings and performing operations based on that. If the gas limit is insufficient to complete all necessary operations, the function may fail or produce unexpected results.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define access control mechanisms, such as restricting specific functions to certain roles or addresses. This lack of visibility control could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical contract functionalities by external entities.

5) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include a mechanism to prevent unauthorized deletion or self-destruct functionality. This lack of protection could make the contract vulnerable to potential attacks aimed at destroying its functionality or draining its funds.
