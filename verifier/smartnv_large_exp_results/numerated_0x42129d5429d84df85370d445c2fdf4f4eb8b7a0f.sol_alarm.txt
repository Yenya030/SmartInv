Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without ensuring that the previous proposal has been finalized, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Privilege escalation: The owner of the contract is not properly managed or restricted in the functions, allowing potential privilege escalation attacks.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is potential for integer overflow in the calculatePrice() function if the balance of USDC or WETH becomes very large.
