The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the variable "lockedFunds" without checking if the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" is still valid, which may lead to inconsistent state update.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is missing the visibility specifier for the "proposal" variable and functions like "votedProposal", which may lead to incorrect access control or visibility issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
