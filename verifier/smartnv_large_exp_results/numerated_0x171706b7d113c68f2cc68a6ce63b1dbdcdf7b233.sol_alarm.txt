Output: 
- Business logic flaw: Lack of validation for delegate in the Voter struct could lead to unauthorized voting if not properly controlled.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is a possibility of voters voting multiple times by exploiting the lack of check for unique voter identifiers.
- Inconsistent state update: Not ensuring atomicity in vote() function can lead to inconsistent data if multiple votes are made concurrently.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of voters and voteCount could expose sensitive information and the owner attribute could be exploited if not properly secured.
