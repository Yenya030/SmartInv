The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` without ensuring proper synchronization with other state variables, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate` function, which may result in unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, which could lead to unexpected access control issues.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
