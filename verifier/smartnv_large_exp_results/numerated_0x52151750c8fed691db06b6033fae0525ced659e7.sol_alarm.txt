The potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any synchronization mechanism, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.

2) Integer overflow/underflow:
   - There is a potential for integer overflow in the `liquidate` function when calculating the value `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`, this can lead to unexpected behavior if the calculated value exceeds the maximum value that the uint type can hold.
