The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- In the function execute(), the update of proposal.votedAmount can be susceptible to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions execute the function concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The owner variable is defined as internal which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility or ownership control issues.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The function endExecute() involves a potential gas issue due to the multiplication operation in the line:
`require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");`
This might lead to gas limit exceeded errors for certain scenarios, potentially resulting in failed executions.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
