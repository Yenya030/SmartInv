Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal value without properly initializing it first, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() does multiple operations that should be executed atomically but are not wrapped in a single transaction, leading to potential atomicity violations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20, but it does not have the required functions and variables, indicating a potential incorrect visibility/ownership issue.
