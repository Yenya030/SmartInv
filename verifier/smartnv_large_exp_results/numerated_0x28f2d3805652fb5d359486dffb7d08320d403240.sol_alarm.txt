Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which means anyone can access and modify it. This can lead to unauthorized access to certain functions or data within the contract.

2) Insufficient gas: The `buyTokens` function transfers tokens from the caller to the contract and then transfers the same amount back to the caller. This can lead to out-of-gas errors if the caller does not have enough gas to cover both transfers.

3) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency issue in the contract, where the `withdrawTokens` function allows only the owner to withdraw tokens. However, the `owner` is publicly accessible and can be modified by anyone.
