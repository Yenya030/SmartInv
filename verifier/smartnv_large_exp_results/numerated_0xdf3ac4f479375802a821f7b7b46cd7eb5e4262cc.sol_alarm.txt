The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without clearing the previous value assigned to it. This can lead to inconsistent state updates as the variable may contain old or incorrect data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
The contract `ExchangeTokens` does not specify any visibility for the `liquidate` and `calculatePrice` functions, making them publicly accessible. This can pose a security risk if sensitive operations are being performed in these functions without proper access control.

3) Arithmetic flaw: 
In the `liquidate` function of the `ExchangeTokens` contract, there is a potential arithmetic flaw in the comparison `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount`. Depending on the data types and input values, this calculation may result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities such as integer overflow or underflow.

4) Insufficient gas: 
The `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract returns a value without specifying any gas limit for the computation. This can lead to insufficient gas error if the computation exceeds the gas limit, causing the function to fail.
