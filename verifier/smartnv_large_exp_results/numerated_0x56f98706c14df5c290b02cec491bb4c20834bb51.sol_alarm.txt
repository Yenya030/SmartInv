Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation (no access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to only authorized users)
2) Inconsistent state update (changing state variables without proper validation or synchronization)
3) Insufficient gas (possible out-of-gas issues if gas limit is reached during execution)
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership (missing visibility modifiers or ownership verification for sensitive functions)
5) Potential reentrancy vulnerability (lack of checks to prevent reentrancy attacks)
