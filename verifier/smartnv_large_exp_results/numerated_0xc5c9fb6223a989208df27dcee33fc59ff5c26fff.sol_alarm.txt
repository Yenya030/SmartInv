The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without validating the conditions properly, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Integer underflow: There is a possibility of integer underflow in the function liquidate() as the subtraction operation dAmount - (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) could result in underflow if the calculation exceeds the value of dAmount.
