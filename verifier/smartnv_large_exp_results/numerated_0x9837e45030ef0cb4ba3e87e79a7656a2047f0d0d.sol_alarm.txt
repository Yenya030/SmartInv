The contract mentioned for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;
    uint public maxVotes = 100;

    function vote(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid vote amount");
        require(totalVotes + amount <= maxVotes, "Exceeds maximum votes limit");
        
        votes[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalVotes += amount;
    }

    function redeem() public {
        uint voteAmount = votes[msg.sender];
        require(voteAmount > 0, "No votes to redeem");
        
        // Redeem logic
        votes[msg.sender] = 0;
        totalVotes -= voteAmount;
        
        msg.sender.transfer(voteAmount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) insufficient gas
2) inconsistent state update
