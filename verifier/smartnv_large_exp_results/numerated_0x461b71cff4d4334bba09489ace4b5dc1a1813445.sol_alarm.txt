The potential vulnerabilities in the contract TokenSale are:

1) inconsistent state update - The tokenAmount is directly transferred to the beneficiary regardless of the availability of tokens in the contract, which may lead to an inconsistent state if tokens are not sufficient.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership - The withdrawTokens function can be called by any address, not just the owner, due to the lack of access control, potentially leading to unauthorized token withdrawals.
