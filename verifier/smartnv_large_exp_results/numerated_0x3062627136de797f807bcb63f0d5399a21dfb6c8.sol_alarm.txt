Contract:

contract Auction {
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid needs to be higher than current highest bid");
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            // Refund the previous highest bid
            payable(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid);
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
        bids[msg.sender] = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Highest bidder cannot withdraw until auction ends");
        uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    function endAuction() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can end the auction");
        // Transfer the highest bid amount to the owner
        payable(owner).transfer(highestBid);

        // Reset auction state
        highestBidder = address(0);
        highestBid = 0;
    }
}

Output:
- Insufficient gas: The contract might run out of gas during the execution of certain functions due to excessive gas consumption.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of certain functions or variables may not be correctly defined, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
