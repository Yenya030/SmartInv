Based on the provided contract snippet, potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20 but it does not define the required functions of the interface. This could lead to potential issues with visibility and ownership.

2) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `proposal` is being updated in multiple functions (startExecute, execute, endExecute) without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute requires executing a significant amount of logic and transferring tokens, which could lead to running out of gas if the gas limit is not set appropriately.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Insufficient gas.
