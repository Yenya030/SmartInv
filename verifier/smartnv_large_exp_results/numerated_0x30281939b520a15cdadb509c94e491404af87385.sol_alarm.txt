The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The use of the `proposal` struct and its related variables in the `execute` function could lead to inconsistent state if multiple users try to execute proposals concurrently.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define visibility for the `votedProposal` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the `execute` function when adding to `proposal.votedAmount`.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require an excessive amount of gas to execute if the condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` is not met.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Integer overflow/underflow, and Insufficient gas.
