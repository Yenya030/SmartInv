This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or atomicity check, which might lead to inconsistent states if multiple transactions are executed simultaneously that involve updating the `proposal.votedAmount` variable. 
   
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function lacks proper atomicity checks when updating the `proposal.votedAmount` variable, which can lead to potential race condition vulnerabilities.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, which may lead to undesired visibility and access control issues. It's important to explicitly define the visibility of variables to ensure proper ownership and access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
