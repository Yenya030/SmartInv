Contract analyzed: 

contract VotingSystem {
    uint public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    function vote() public {
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function revokeVote() public {
        require(hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have not voted yet");
        totalVotes--;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = false;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation (hasVoted mapping needs to check for duplicate addresses)
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (public visibility of totalVotes may lead to manipulation)
- Insufficient gas (increasing totalVotes may require a large amount of gas if the function is called frequently)
