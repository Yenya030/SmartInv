The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract could be:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state of tokenA and tokenB balances might not be accurately updated after the swap due to the interleaving transfer calls.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and access control over the tokenA and tokenB contracts are not properly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access to these tokens.
