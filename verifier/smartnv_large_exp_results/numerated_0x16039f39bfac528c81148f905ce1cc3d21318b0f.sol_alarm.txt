The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` does not update the `proposal.sTime` to 0 after execution, which could lead to the contract incorrectly considering a proposal as ongoing when it has actually ended. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and other variables are declared without specifying their visibility (public, internal, private), which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. 

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas usage of the `endExecute()` function, it could potentially run out of gas if the gas limit is not enough to complete all the required operations within the function. 

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could potentially lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior in the contract. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Insufficient gas, and ID uniqueness violation.
