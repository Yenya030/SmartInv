The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function without any synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple calls modify the variable simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may require a significant amount of gas if the `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` condition is not met, potentially causing out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken.transferFrom()` function in the `execute()` function is called without specifying the `internal` or `public` visibility, which could potentially expose the contract to unauthorized transfers.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure its security and proper function.
