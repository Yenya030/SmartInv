The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable 'proposal' is being updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may require a large amount of gas to execute if the balance check condition is not met, potentially causing the transaction to fail due to insufficient gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
