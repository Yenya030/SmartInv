In the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is set to internal, which may not be intended.
2) inconsistent state update: The startingBalanceList mapping is updated in the startExecute function, but it is not clear how this mapping is used or maintained throughout the contract.
3) insufficient gas: The endExecute function directly updates a state variable (lockedFunds) based on the balance of the contract, which may lead to out-of-gas issues if the contract holds a large amount of tokens.
4) business logic flaw: There are some business logic flaws, such as the requirement for execution in the endExecute function is checking whether the balance of the contract is more than double the total supply of the voting token, which might not make sense depending on the context.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and business logic flaw.
