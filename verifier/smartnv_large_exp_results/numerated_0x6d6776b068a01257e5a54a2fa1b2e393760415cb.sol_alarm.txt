The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Crowdsale {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalTokens;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(uint _totalTokens, uint _tokenPrice) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalTokens = _totalTokens;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _numTokens * tokenPrice, "Incorrect payment amount");
        require(totalTokens >= _numTokens, "Not enough tokens left");

        balances[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
        totalTokens -= _numTokens;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        
        uint amount = address(this).balance;
        payable(owner).transfer(amount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is public, allowing anyone to view the owner's address. This may expose sensitive information and potentially lead to privilege escalation if the owner's address is compromised.
2) inconsistent state update: The 'totalTokens' variable is decremented in the buyTokens function without checking for potential integer underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3) insufficient gas: The withdrawFunds function does not specify a gas limit for the transfer operation, which could potentially result in the transaction failing due to running out of gas.
