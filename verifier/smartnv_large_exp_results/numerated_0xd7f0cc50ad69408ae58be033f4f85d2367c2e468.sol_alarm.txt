The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables, potentially exposing them to manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables without properly ensuring consistency between them.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas limit is reached due to the potentially high gas cost of the `require` statement checking for execution failure.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for `proposal.addr`, which may lead to conflicts or unintended behavior if the same address is used multiple times.

5) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the contract state.

6) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state changes without proper atomicity guarantees, leaving room for potential race conditions or inconsistent states.

7) Ether leakage: The contract does not explicitly handle ether transactions, leaving it susceptible to unintentional ether transfers or vulnerabilities related to ether management. 

8) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of explicit checks for potential integer overflows or underflows in the contract, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. 

9) Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws in the contract that could affect the intended functionality or lead to unintended consequences. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, ether leakage, integer overflow/underflow, and business logic flaw.
