The contract at the end contains potential vulnerabilities in the form of: 

1) Business logic flaw: The function calculatePrice() does not properly calculate the price, which could lead to incorrect operations and potential losses in the trading process. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables WETH, USDC, and pair are declared as public, which could expose sensitive information to external users. It is advisable to use private or internal visibility for these variables to protect data integrity.
