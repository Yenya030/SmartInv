Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place, potentially allowing unauthorized users to call sensitive functions or modify important state variables.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented directly without any checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas to execute, especially if the `votingToken.transferFrom` or `votedProposal` functions involve complex operations. This could potentially result in the transaction failing due to running out of gas.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables and functions in the contract is not explicitly defined (e.g., public, internal, private), which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external actors. Additionally, the ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, which may pose a risk if ownership transfer is necessary for proper contract management.
