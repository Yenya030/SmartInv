The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without any proper validation or checks, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables owner, votingToken, proposal, and startingBalanceList, which can lead to potential issues with owner access control and data visibility.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() includes a gas-intensive operation with the requirement of checking the balance of the contract address, which may lead to out-of-gas exceptions and failed executions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
