The contract for analysis:

```solidity
contract AuctionHouse {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;

    function bid(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
        require(bids[msg.sender] + _amount > bids[msg.sender], "Integer overflow");
        
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            bids[highestBidder] += highestBid; 
        }

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = _amount;
        bids[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
9) integer overflow/underflow
