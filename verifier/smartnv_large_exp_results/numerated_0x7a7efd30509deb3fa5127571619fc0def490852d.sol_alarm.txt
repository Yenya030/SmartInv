Potential vulnerabilities in contract TokenSale:
- Arithmetic flaw: Multiplying msg.value by 10 could potentially lead to an arithmetic flaw if the resulting value exceeds the uint data type limit.
- Ether leakage: The transfer function in the withdraw function could lead to ether leakage if not properly handled, allowing malicious actors to drain the contract's balance.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas limits for the functions, which could result in out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.
