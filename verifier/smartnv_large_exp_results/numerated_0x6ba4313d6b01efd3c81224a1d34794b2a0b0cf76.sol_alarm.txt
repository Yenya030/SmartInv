The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Lottery {
    address public owner;
    uint public ticketPrice;
    uint public totalTickets;
    mapping(address => uint) public ticketsBought;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        ticketPrice = 1 ether;
        totalTickets = 0;
    }
    
    function buyTicket() public payable {
        require(msg.value >= ticketPrice, "Insufficient payment for ticket");
        ticketsBought[msg.sender] += 1;
        totalTickets += 1;
    }
    
    function drawWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can draw the winner");
        require(totalTickets > 0, "No tickets bought yet");
        
        uint winningTicket = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % totalTickets;
        address winner;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalTickets; i++) {
            if (ticketsBought[address(i)] == winningTicket) {
                winner = address(i);
                break;
            }
        }
        
        payable(winner).transfer(totalTickets * ticketPrice);
        totalTickets = 0;
    }
}

Output: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The implementation of drawWinner function could potentially lead to an inconsistent state update due to the way the winning ticket is calculated and the loop that identifies the winner.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The drawWinner function allows only the owner to draw the winner, but the owner variable is public, which could lead to visibility issues if the owner requires stricter access control.
3) Ether leakage: The transfer of funds to the winner in drawWinner function is susceptible to potential ether leakage if the transfer fails, leaving the funds in the contract.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility for integer overflow/underflow in the calculations involving totalTickets and ticket prices, which could affect the functionality of the contract.
