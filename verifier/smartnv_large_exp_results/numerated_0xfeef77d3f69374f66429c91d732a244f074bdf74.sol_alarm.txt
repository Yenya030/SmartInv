Contract to Analyze:
contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalPayments;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function makePayment(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect payment amount sent");
        totalPayments += amount;
        owner.transfer(amount);
    }
    
    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
} 

Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) privilege escalation
2) inconsistent state update
