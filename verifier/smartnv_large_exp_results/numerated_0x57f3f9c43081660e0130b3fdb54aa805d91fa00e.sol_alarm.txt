Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct directly, which can lead to inconsistencies in the state if accessed concurrently.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for tracking ownership.
