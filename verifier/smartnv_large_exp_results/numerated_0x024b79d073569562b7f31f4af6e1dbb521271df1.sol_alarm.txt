The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any further validation, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if the conditions are not properly checked.

2) atomicity violation: The functions `execute()` and `endExecute()` involve multiple state changes that could potentially not be atomic, leading to unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails or reverts.

3) ether leakage: There is no validation or secure handling of Ether transfers in the contract, exposing it to potential ether leakage or unauthorized fund transfers.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and ether leakage.
