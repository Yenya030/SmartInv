Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: In the function calculatePrice(), there is a possibility of integer overflow if the result of the division operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint data type.

2) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mapping without any checks or validations, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the functions in the contract is not specified explicitly, which could lead to issues related to access control and ownership.
