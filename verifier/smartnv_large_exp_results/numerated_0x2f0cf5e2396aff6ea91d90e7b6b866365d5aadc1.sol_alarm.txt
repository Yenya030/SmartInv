The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function without any checks or validation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function transfers tokens using `votingToken.transferFrom`, but there is no check to ensure that enough gas is provided for the transfer to be successful, which can result in the transaction failing due to insufficient gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is defined as public, which exposes its value to all external callers. It may be more appropriate to define it as internal or private to maintain ownership and access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
