The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract inheriting from IERC20 does not specify the visibility of the functions defined in the interface, which could lead to incorrect function visibility and ownership concerns.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function has a state update operation where `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented directly, which could lead to inconsistent state changes if multiple calls are made concurrently.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially require a large amount of gas if the `require` condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` is not carefully optimized, leading to potential gas issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
