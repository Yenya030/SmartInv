The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute()` function updates the state of the `proposal` struct without checking if it is already in progress, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface, but it is unclear if the necessary ERC20 functions are properly implemented and accessible.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function performs a check on the balance of the contract, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially fail if not enough gas is supplied.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
