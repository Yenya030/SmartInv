The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state without checking if it is already set, which could lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but it is not clear if it is the correct implementation, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
