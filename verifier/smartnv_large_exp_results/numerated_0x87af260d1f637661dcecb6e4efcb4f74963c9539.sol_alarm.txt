The contract for analysis is:

contract Lottery {
    address public owner;
    uint public numParticipants;
    mapping(address => bool) participants;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        numParticipants = 0;
    }
    
    function participate() public {
        require(msg.sender != owner, "Owner cannot participate");
        require(participants[msg.sender] == false, "Cannot participate twice");
        
        participants[msg.sender] = true;
        numParticipants++;
    }
    
    function selectWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can select winner");
        require(numParticipants > 0, "No participants to select winner from");
        
        address winner = getRandomParticipant();
        // Send prize to winner
    }
    
    function getRandomParticipant() private view returns (address) {
        // Logic to randomly select participant
    }
}

Based on the contract provided, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:
1) privilege escalation
2) business logic flaw
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
