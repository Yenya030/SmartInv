The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly in the `execute` function without performing proper validation or checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not define the visibility of the `owner` variable, which can potentially lead to issues related to ownership and access control.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may encounter out-of-gas issues due to the large gas consumption of the `balanceOf` function in the require statement, especially if the contract holds a large number of tokens.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which may lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously.

5) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function carries out multiple state changes without using any mechanism to ensure atomicity, which can leave the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks and race conditions.
