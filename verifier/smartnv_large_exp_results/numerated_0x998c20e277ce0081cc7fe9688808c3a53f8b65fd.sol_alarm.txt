This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without properly handling concurrency issues, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal` but never used, which may indicate a potential oversight in ownership control.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially expensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`) without considering gas limits, which could lead to out-of-gas errors. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in this contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas handling.
