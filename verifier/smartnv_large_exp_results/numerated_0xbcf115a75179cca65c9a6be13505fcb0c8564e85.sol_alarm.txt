potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variables proposal.sTime, proposal.votedAmount, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds in different functions without ensuring consistency or atomicity, which could lead to unexpected behavior or manipulation of the contract state.

2) integer overflow/underflow: There are several arithmetic operations performed in the contract, such as adding amounts in execute function or calculating lockedFunds in endExecute function, without proper checks for potential integer overflow or underflow.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the implementation for all required functions. This could lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that rely on the full interface implementation.

Overall, the contract may be vulnerable to inconsistent state updates, integer overflows/underflows, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
