Potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security issues.
2) inconsistent state update - There are multiple state variables being updated within the functions without proper checks or validation, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) insufficient gas - There is a risk of running out of gas during function execution, especially in the 'endExecute' function which transfers tokens and updates balances without sufficient gas allocation.
4) atomicity violation - There are multiple state changes happening within functions that are not wrapped in a single transaction, which can lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.
5) ID uniqueness violation - There are no checks to ensure uniqueness of certain identifiers such as proposal addresses, which can lead to conflicts or incorrect data manipulation.
6) ether leakage - There are potential vulnerabilities related to ether leakage due to the lack of proper validation in token transfers or balance updates.
