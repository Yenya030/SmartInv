The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities, which are:

1) Business Logic Flaw: The function `liquidate` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract can potentially have a business logic flaw. The calculation for liquidation (`getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount`) might not accurately determine if a user's funds can be liquidated, leading to incorrect outcomes.

2) Arithmetic Flaw: The same function `liquidate` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract also potentially suffers from an arithmetic flaw. The calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` might result in unexpected outcomes due to the order of operations or unintended rounding errors. 

3) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The visibility of the `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract is set to `public payable`, but it does not contain any logic related to receiving payments. This could lead to confusion for users interacting with the contract.

In summary, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are business logic flaw, arithmetic flaw, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
