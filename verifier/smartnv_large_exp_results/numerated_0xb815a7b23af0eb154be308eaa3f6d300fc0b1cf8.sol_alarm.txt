The contract being analyzed:

contract AuctionContract {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;
    mapping(address => uint) public funds;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        funds[highestBidder] += highestBid;
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Highest bidder cannot withdraw until auction ends");
        uint amount = funds[msg.sender];
        funds[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
