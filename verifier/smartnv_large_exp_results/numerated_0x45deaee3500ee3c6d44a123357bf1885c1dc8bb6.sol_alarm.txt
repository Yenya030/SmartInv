The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the `execute` function to be called externally, potentially leading to privilege escalation if not properly controlled.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` struct's `votedAmount` without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple operations that should ideally be executed atomically, such as transferring tokens and updating state variables.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not specified with a visibility specifier, making it public by default and potentially exposing sensitive information. Additionally, the permissions and ownership control mechanisms are not clearly defined in the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
