    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public payments;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function makePayment(uint256 paymentId, uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can make payments");
        payments[paymentId] = amount;
    }

    function getPayment(uint256 paymentId) public view returns (uint256) {
        return payments[paymentId];
    }
}
<\contract_3\>
