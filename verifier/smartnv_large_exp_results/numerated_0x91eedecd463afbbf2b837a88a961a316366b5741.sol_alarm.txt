Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal by incrementing the votedAmount without updating it atomically. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple calls are made concurrently or if an external call changes the state simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may fail to execute completely if it runs out of gas due to the requirement for the execution to have ended. This can leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions such as proposal, votingToken, lockedFunds, getStartingBalance(), and votedProposal() is not specified. This can lead to potential issues in contract functionality and security.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
