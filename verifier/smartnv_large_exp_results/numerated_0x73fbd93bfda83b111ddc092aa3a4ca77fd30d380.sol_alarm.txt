The contract that needs to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract VotingSystem {
     mapping(address => uint) public votes;
     uint public totalVotes;
     address public admin; 

     function vote(uint _amount) public {
         require(_amount > 0, "Invalid vote amount");
         votes[msg.sender] += _amount;
         totalVotes += _amount;
     }

     function changeAdmin(address _newAdmin) public {
         require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
         admin = _newAdmin;
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is public, making it accessible to anyone to change. This may lead to privilege escalation if an unauthorized user is able to change the admin.
- Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions if the gas amount provided is not enough for the computational steps required.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the `totalVotes` variable if the sum of votes exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a uint.
