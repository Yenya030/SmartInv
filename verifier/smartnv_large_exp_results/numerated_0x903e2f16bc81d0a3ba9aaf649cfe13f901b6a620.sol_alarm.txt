The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state variable proposal.votedAmount without checking if the proposal has actually been successfully voted on, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to potential visibility issues if it should be kept private.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function locks up funds in the contract without specifying a gas limit, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
