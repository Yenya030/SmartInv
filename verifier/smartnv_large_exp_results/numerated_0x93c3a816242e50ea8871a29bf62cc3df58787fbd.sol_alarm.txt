The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the variable `lockedFunds` without considering any potential re-entrancy attacks or ensuring proper state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not specify the visibility for the functions defined in the interface, which could lead to incorrect function visibility.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas in the `execute()` function if the gas required for the `votingToken.transferFrom()` operation exceeds the gas stipend provided to the contract.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential risk of integer overflow in the calculation of `startingBlance` in the `startExecute()` function if `getStartingBalance()` returns a very large value.

5) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include any functionality to prevent self-destruct (suicidal) actions, which could result in the contract being destroyed and its funds being unrecoverable.

6) Ether leakage: There is no mechanism in place to handle ether transactions securely, which could lead to unintended ether leakage or loss.
