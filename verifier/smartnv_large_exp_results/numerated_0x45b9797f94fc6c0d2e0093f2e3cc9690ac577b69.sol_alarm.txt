The contract provided is:

contract RewardsContract {
         IERC20 public rewardToken;
         mapping(address => uint) public rewards;
         
         function distributeRewards(address user, uint amount) public {
             require(rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount,
             "insufficient rewards in contract");
             rewards[user] += amount;
         }
         
         function claimRewards(address user) public {
             uint rewardAmount = rewards[user];
             require(rewardAmount > 0, "no rewards to claim");
             rewards[user] = 0;
             rewardToken.transfer(user, rewardAmount);
         }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: It is possible that the rewards[user] += amount operation in the distributeRewards function could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: If the contract balance runs low on gas, there could be issues with executing the transfer function in the claimRewards function.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Depending on the intended functionality, the visibility of the rewards mapping and the owner of the contract may not be appropriately defined.
