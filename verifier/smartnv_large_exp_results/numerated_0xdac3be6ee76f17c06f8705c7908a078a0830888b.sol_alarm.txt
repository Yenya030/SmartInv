The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList`, which could lead to potential issues with data access control.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function does not reset the `proposal` struct after the execution ends, which could lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior in subsequent transactions.

3) Insufficient gas: The gas limit for the `execute()` function is not controlled, which may lead to out-of-gas exceptions if the function requires more gas than available.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
