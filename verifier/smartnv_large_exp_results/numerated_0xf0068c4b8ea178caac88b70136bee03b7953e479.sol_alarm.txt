Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Price manipulation: The function liquidate relies on the getPrice function, which is not shown in the contract, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the price and liquidate funds improperly. 
3) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function uses a fixed ratio (80%) for comparing collateral and debt amounts, which may not accurately represent the true value of the assets and lead to incorrect liquidations.
