The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable 'lockedFunds' is updated in the 'endExecute' function without any restriction or validation.

2) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the transaction due to the gas-intensive operation of checking the balance of the contract against the total supply of the voting token.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is marked as internal, which may lead to issues related to the visibility and ownership of the contract. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
