Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state of the proposal struct and startingBalanceList without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not properly define the required functions, such as balanceOf and transfer, which could result in incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts expecting a standard ERC20 interface.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a complex operation by checking the balance and total supply of the votingToken within a single require statement, which may require excessive gas to execute and could potentially result in an out-of-gas error.
