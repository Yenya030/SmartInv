Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict privileged functions to only authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized actors to escalate their privileges.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract lacks proper checks and balances when updating state variables, which could lead to unexpected or inconsistent state changes within the contract.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs mathematical operations without explicitly checking for potential overflow or underflow, which could result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not correctly define the visibility of functions and variables, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionalities to external actors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Privilege escalation, Inconsistent state update, Integer overflow/underflow, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
