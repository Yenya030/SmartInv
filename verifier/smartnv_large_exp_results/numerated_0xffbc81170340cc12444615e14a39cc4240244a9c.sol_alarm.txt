Contract to analyze:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(uint _tokenPrice) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Incorrect payment amount");

        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }

    function withdrawTokens(address _recipient, uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw tokens");
        require(balances[_recipient] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[_recipient] -= _amount;
    }
}

Output: 
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
