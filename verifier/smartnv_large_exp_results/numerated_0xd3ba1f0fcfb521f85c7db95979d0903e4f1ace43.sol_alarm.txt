Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The "votedProposal" function is referenced but not defined in the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the "owner" variable is not specified, which could lead to ownership control issues.
3) insufficient gas: The execution of the "endExecute" function might require excessive gas due to the comparison of the balance of the contract with the total supply, which could result in out-of-gas errors.
