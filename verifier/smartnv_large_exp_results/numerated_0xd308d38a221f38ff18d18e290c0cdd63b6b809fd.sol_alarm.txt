Contract analysis:<\example_1\>
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may unintentionally give access to certain functions to other contracts within the same inheritance tree. Consider changing the visibility of `owner` to private.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no corresponding state update for this variable in the rest of the contract. Make sure to consistently update the state of variables throughout the contract.

1) Price manipulation: The `liquidate` function uses a calculation based on the `getPrice()` function, which may be manipulated externally to exploit the liquidation process. Consider implementing safeguards to prevent potential price manipulation attacks.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the `calculatePrice` function, the division operation can potentially lead to division by zero if `WETH.balanceOf(address(pair))` is zero. Ensure proper checks are in place to handle such arithmetic flaws.
