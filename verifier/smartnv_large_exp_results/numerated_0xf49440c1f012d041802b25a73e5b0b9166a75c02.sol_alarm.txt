Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract seems to be updating the state based on external conditions without proper checks, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not specified, which can lead to security risks.
3) Business logic flaw: The logic of the functions in the contract may not be properly designed, leading to potential vulnerabilities in the execution flow.
