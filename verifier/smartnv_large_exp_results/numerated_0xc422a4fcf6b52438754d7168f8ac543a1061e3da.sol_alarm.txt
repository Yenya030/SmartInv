The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent State Update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` state without resetting or clearing previous values, potentially leading to inconsistent state management.

2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for this variable. It could be a vulnerability if the intention was to restrict access to only the owner.

3) Insufficient Gas: Depending on the gas limit set by the user or the calling context, the operations within the functions may run out of gas, leading to incomplete execution or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent State Update, Incorrect Visibility/Ownership, and Insufficient Gas.
