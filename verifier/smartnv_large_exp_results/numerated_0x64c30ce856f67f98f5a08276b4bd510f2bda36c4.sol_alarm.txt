} 

Output:
- arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the vestedAmount function may result in an arithmetic flaw due to integer division.
- inconsistent state update: The released amount is updated before checking if the to address is valid, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
- insufficient gas: The transfer function may require excessive gas for execution, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The release function should be restricted to specific owners to prevent unauthorized releases.
