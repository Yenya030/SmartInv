Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: Multiple proposals can be created without checking for uniqueness, leading to potential conflicts or overwriting of data.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated without proper synchronization, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.
3) Insufficient gas: The gas cost for certain operations, such as transferring tokens, is not explicitly managed or accounted for, which could lead to transaction failures or incomplete executions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, opening up the possibility of unauthorized access or manipulation.
