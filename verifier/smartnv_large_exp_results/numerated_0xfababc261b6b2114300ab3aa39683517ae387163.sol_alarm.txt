The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities such as:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds without ensuring that the conditions for the balance calculation are consistently applied throughout the contract.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the liquidate() function of the ExchangeTokens contract, there is an arithmetic flaw in the calculation of the liquidation condition, which could potentially lead to incorrect liquidation decisions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and arithmetic flaw.
