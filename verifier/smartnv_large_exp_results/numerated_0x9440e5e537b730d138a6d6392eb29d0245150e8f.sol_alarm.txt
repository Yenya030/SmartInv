Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is internal, which may lead to unexpected access control issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The startingBalanceList mapping is updated in the startExecute function, but it is not defined in the contract.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if the gas provided is not enough for the required operations.
4) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the balance in the contract is twice the total supply of the voting token, which may not be the intended logic for execution.
