Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal struct by incrementing the votedAmount, but it does not check for overflow, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The startExecute function does not ensure that the proposal ID is unique, which could lead to conflicts or overwrite existing proposals.
3) Atomicity violation: The endExecute function involves multiple state changes, such as checking balance, which could be manipulated between these operations by external actors.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, allowing potential unauthorized access or manipulation.

Overall, the contract contains vulnerabilities related to state management, atomicity, and permissions that should be addressed to ensure its security.
