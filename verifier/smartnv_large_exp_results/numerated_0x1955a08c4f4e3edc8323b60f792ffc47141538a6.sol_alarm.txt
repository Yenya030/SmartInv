This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'endExecute()' function updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without any corresponding modifier on the visibility or access control, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is defined as internal, potentially allowing unintended access to its data.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
