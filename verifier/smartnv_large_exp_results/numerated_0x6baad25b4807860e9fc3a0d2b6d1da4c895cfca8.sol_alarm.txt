For the given contract, potential vulnerabilities are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without properly handling potential race conditions or re-entrancy, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may fail due to running out of gas, especially when dealing with large amounts of token transfers.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility modifiers for functions or state variables, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external parties.
