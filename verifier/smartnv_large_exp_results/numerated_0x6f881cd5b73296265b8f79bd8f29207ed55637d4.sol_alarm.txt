The contract provided for analysis:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }
}

Output: 
- Reentrancy vulnerability: The function bid() transfers funds to the highestBidder before updating the highestBidder address and highestBid value, allowing a malicious user to reenter the function before the state is updated and potentially manipulate the outcome of the auction.
