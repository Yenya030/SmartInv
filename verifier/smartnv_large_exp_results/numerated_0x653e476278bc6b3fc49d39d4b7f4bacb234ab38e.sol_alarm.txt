The contract you have provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without updating any other variables or states that might be affected by this change. This can lead to inconsistent data within the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility modifiers for functions or variables, which can lead to potential security risks if sensitive functions or data are accessible publicly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
