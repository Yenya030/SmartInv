There are potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is missing the visibility specifier in the interface declaration of the TimelockController contract.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals.
3) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function of the TimelockController contract, the votedAmount is updated with the operator "+=" which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function in the TimelockController contract may require a large amount of gas if the number of voters is too high, potentially leading to insufficient gas issues.
