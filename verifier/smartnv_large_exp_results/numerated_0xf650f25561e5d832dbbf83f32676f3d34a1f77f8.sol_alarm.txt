Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController declares that it implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide the required functions specified in the interface.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables owner, votingToken, proposal, startingBlance, startingBalanceList, lockedFunds are all declared as internal or not specified, which could lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The function votedProposal(proposal) is referenced but not defined within the contract, potentially leading to compile errors or unexpected behavior.
- Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount field of the proposal struct without verifying if the transfer of tokens is successful, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state if the transfer fails.
