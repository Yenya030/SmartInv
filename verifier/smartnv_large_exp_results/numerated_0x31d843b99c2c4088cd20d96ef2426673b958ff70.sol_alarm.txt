The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function but it is not clear how this information will be used or interacted with in the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is called without being defined in the contract, which could lead to issues with accessibility or ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
