Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, but it does not handle the scenario where the `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` condition fails. This can lead to an inconsistent state where `lockedFunds` might not accurately represent the locked funds.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface, but it is not clear if all the required functions are implemented or if they have the correct visibility (public, internal, external) specified. This can lead to issues with contract interaction and ownership.

3) Reentrancy: The `execute` function transfers tokens using `votingToken.transferFrom`, which can potentially allow reentrancy attacks if the receiving contract performs unexpected operations or calls back into the `execute` function before completing the transfer.

4) Arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate` function of the `ExchangeTokens` contract, there is a potential arithmetic flaw in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`. Depending on the input values, this calculation may result in integer overflow/underflow or truncation errors.

5) Ether leakage: The `calculatePrice` function accepts Ether (`payable`) but does not utilize it in any way. This can lead to Ether leakage if users unintentionally send Ether to this function.

6) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms in place, such as role-based permissions or modifiers to restrict certain functions to only authorized users. This can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
