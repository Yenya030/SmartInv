Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without any protection against reentrancy, which could lead to incorrect state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to potential vulnerabilities related to incorrect visibility and ownership.
