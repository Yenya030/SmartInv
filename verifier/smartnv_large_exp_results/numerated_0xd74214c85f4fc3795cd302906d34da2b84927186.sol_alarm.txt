The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any protection against reentrancy attacks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `IERC20` interface is being inherited, but the contract is not implementing all the required functions from the interface, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are related to inconsistent state updates and incorrect visibility/ownership.
