Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variables lockedFunds without proper synchronization or checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables owner, votingToken, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds, which could potentially lead to incorrect access control or ownership issues.
