contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) hasVoted;
    uint256 totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that the same address cannot vote multiple times, potentially allowing for duplicate or fake votes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variable `totalVotes` is public, meaning anyone can read the total number of votes without any restrictions, potentially revealing sensitive information.
