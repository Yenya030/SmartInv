The contract for analysis:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = _amount;
    }

    function releaseAmountToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
        seller.transfer(amount);
    }

    function refundAmountToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund funds");
        buyer.transfer(amount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- privilege escalation: The arbiter has the ability to release funds and refund funds, which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to funds.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions releaseAmountToSeller() and refundAmountToBuyer() can only be called by the arbiter, which may restrict the proper flow of funds. 
- inconsistent state update: There is no check for whether the funds have already been released or refunded before executing the respective functions, which may lead to improper state changes.
