This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which can lead to potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state update operations happening in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) related to the `proposal` struct, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Limited access control: There is no explicit access control mechanism implemented in the functions, which could lead to unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities.
4) Lack of input validation: The `execute` function does not validate the `amount` parameter, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities such as integer overflow/underflow.
5) Lack of reentrancy protection: The contract does not include any reentrancy protection mechanisms, which can lead to potential reentrancy attacks.
6) Lack of error handling: The contract lacks comprehensive error handling mechanisms, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. 

Overall, the contract has several potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed for improved security.
