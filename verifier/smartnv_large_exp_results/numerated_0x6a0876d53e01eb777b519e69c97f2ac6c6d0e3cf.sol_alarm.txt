The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) arithmetic flaw: The comparison `msg.sender.balance > 0` might lead to an arithmetic flaw since 'balance' returns the balance of the address in Wei, and comparing it directly to 0 may not be the intended behavior. 
2) inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state update if the state variables `hasVoted` and `voteCount` are not updated atomically, leading to unexpected behavior.
