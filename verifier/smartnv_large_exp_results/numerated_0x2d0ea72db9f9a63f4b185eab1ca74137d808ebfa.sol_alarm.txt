The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of the `votedProposal` function is not specified, making it public by default. It should be explicitly set to the desired visibility.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without any concurrency control mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple executions happen simultaneously.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function requires transferring tokens and updating state variables, which may require significant gas to execute. If the gas limit is not set appropriately, the function may run out of gas before completing its tasks.

4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure that `proposal.addr` is a unique identifier, potentially leading to conflicts or data corruption.

5) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have any mechanism to prevent self-destruct or suicide operations, which can result in irrecoverable loss of funds or data.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: Incorrect visibility, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, and suicidal contracts.
