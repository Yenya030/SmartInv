Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in the contract ExchangeTokens updates the debt and collateral mappings without proper validation or checks, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs arithmetic operations without proper validation or overflow/underflow checks, which could lead to arithmetic flaws.
3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, which could result in ether leakage or unintended transfers.
4) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract do not consider potential gas limitations which could lead to the functions failing due to insufficient gas.
