Contract to be analyzed:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }
    
    function resetVotes() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can reset votes");
        totalVotes = 0;
    }
    
    function getOwner() public view returns(address) {
        return owner;
    }
} 

Output:
- Correct implementation, healthy.
