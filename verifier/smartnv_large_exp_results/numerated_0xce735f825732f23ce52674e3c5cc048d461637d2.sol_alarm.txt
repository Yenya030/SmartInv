Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - the `votingToken` and `startingBalanceList` variables are not specified with any visibility modifier, potentially allowing unintended access or modification.
2) inconsistent state update - the `proposal` struct is directly modified in multiple functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`), which could lead to unintended state changes or unexpected behavior.
3) atomicity violation - there are multiple state changes within functions (`execute`, `endExecute`) that are not wrapped in a single transaction, potentially leading to partial execution and inconsistent state.
4) insufficient gas - the `endExecute` function could potentially fail if the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of the `require` statements, leading to a failed execution.
5) ID uniqueness violation - the `proposal` struct does not have any mechanism to ensure unique IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals are created simultaneously.
