The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Lottery {
    address public winner;
    uint public winningNumber;
    mapping(address => uint) public userTickets;

    function buyTicket(uint _number) public {
        require(_number > 0 && _number < 101, "Number must be between 1 and 100");
        uint ticketPrice = 0.1 ether;
        require(msg.value == ticketPrice, "Incorrect ticket price");
        
        userTickets[msg.sender] = _number;
    }

    function drawWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can draw the winner");
        winningNumber = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp))) % 100 + 1;
        
        for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (userTickets[msg.sender] == winningNumber) {
                winner = msg.sender;
                payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
            }
        }
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not define the owner variable or initialize it, but references it in the drawWinner function.
2) inconsistent state update - The drawWinner function has a for loop that checks if the user's ticket matches the winning number inside the loop, which may result in unexpected behavior.
3) integer overflow/underflow - The calculation for the winningNumber may result in potential integer overflow if block timestamp generates a large number.
4) ether leakage - The transfer of funds to the winner in the drawWinner function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
5) insufficient gas - The drawWinner function may consume a lot of gas due to the loop, potentially leading to out-of-gas exceptions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
 - incorrect visibility/ownership
 - inconsistent state update
 - integer overflow/underflow
 - ether leakage
 - insufficient gas
