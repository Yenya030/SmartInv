The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` within the `proposal` struct directly, which can lead to inconsistent state if the transfer function fails after updating the `votedAmount`.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the required functions to comply with the interface, potentially leading to incorrect functionality.

3) Insufficient gas: Performing operations like transferring tokens in the `liquidate` function may consume a considerable amount of gas, potentially running out of gas during execution.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple mathematical operations in the contract that can potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.

5) Business logic flaw: There can be potential business logic flaws in the `endExecute` function's condition where it checks if the locked funds are more than half the total supply for execution success.
