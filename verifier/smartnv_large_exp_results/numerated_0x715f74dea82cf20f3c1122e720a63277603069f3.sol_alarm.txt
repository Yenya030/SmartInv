Contract to be analyzed:

contract PaymentProcessor {
     address public owner;
     mapping(address => uint) public payments;
     uint public totalPayments;

     constructor() {
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function makePayment() public payable {
         require(msg.value > 0, "Payment amount cannot be zero");
         payments[msg.sender] += msg.value;
         totalPayments += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
         uint amount = totalPayments;
         totalPayments = 0;
         (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
         require(success, "Withdrawal failed");
     }
}

Output: 
1) correct 

The contract does not contain any potential vulnerabilities.
