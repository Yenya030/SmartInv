Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement any access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling certain functions or accessing sensitive information.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is no clear indication of how the state variables like `lockedFunds` are manipulated and updated, which could lead to inconsistent data or unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the contract adheres to the correct visibility and ownership patterns for certain functions and variables, posing a risk of unauthorized access or modification.
