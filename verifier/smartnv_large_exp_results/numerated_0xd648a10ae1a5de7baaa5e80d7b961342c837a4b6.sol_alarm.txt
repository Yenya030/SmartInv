This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of `votingToken`, but it doesn't ensure that the balance is reduced after updating `lockedFunds`. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface, but it doesn't properly define all the required functions of the interface. This can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership related issues.
