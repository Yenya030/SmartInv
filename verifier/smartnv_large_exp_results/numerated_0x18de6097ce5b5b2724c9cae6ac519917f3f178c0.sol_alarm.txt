The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly in the "execute" function without properly updating the state of the contract. This could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the "proposal" and "startingBalanceList" variables, which could lead to potential issues with data visibility and ownership. 

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks if the balance of the contract is sufficient enough for execution, but it does not consider potential gas costs for the transactions. This could lead to issues if the gas cost is not taken into account properly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
