Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce access control mechanisms, allowing any address to call functions like startExecute and execute.
2) Inconsistent state update: The proposal struct is modified in multiple functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations like proposal.votedAmount += amount; that could potentially result in integer overflow if the value becomes too large.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of certain variables like proposal and startingBalanceList, which could lead to unexpected access and manipulation.
