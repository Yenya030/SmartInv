Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables, which could lead to potential security issues.
2) inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the update to `proposal.votedAmount` does not handle potential race conditions or reentrancy issues, which may result in inconsistent state updates.
3) insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may consume excessive gas, especially if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` is large, causing the transaction to fail due to running out of gas.
4) privilege escalation: The `votedProposal` function is called without being defined in the contract, potentially leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability if this function is defined in a malicious contract.
