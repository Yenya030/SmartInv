Potential Vulnerabilities:
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of voter ID, which could lead to manipulation of votes by creating multiple accounts to vote multiple times.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, which may expose sensitive information to all users of the contract. 

Output:
ID uniqueness violation
Incorrect visibility/ownership
