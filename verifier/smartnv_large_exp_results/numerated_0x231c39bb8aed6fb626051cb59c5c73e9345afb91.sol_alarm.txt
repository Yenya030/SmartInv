The contract provided for analysis:
contract Auction {
         address public highestBidder;
         uint public highestBid;
         mapping(address => uint) public funds;

         function bid() public payable {
             require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid not high enough");
             if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
                 funds[highestBidder] += highestBid; 
             }
             highestBidder = msg.sender;
             highestBid = msg.value;
         }
         function withdraw() public {
             require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Cannot withdraw while being the highest bidder");
             uint amount = funds[msg.sender];
             funds[msg.sender] = 0;
             msg.sender.transfer(amount);
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) inconsistent state update
