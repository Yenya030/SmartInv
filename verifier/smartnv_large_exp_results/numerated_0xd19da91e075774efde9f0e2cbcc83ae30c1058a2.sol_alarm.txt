The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering potential re-entrancy attacks.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is insufficient gas to complete the required operations.
