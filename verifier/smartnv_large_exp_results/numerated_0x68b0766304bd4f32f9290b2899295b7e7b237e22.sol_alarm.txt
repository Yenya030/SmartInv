Contract to analyze:

contract TokenSale {
    address public token; 
    uint public price; 
    uint public availableTokens; 

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        require(availableTokens >= amount, "Not enough tokens available");

        ERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        availableTokens -= amount;
    }

    function updatePrice(uint newPrice) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update the price");
        price = newPrice;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is not defined in the contract, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functions.
- Integer overflow/underflow: The subtraction operation in the buyTokens function can result in integer underflow if amount is greater than availableTokens, leading to unexpected behavior.
- Insufficient gas: The withdrawFunds function transfer operation might run out of gas if the contract balance is too high, preventing the owner from withdrawing funds.
- Incorrect payment amount: There is a potential vulnerability for a price manipulation attack where the attacker can manipulate the amount of tokens by sending a different value than the expected amount.
