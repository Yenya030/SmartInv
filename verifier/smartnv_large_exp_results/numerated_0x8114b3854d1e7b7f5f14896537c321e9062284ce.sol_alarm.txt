The potential vulnerabilities in the contract to analyze are:
1) Inconsistent state update - There is no check for the success of token transfers in the "swapTokens" function. If the token transfers fail, the state of the contract will be inconsistent.
2) Arithmetic flaw - In the "getPrice" function, division operation is being performed on balanceOf values which might lead to arithmetic flaws due to unexpected values or edge cases.
3) Insufficient gas - The "swapTokens" function might require more gas than available, potentially causing the transaction to fail due to insufficient gas.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility of functions is not specified, which may lead to potential issues with access control and ownership.
