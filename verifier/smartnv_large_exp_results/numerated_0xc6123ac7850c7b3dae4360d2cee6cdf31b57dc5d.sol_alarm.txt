The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds value based on the balance of the contract at the end of execution. This may lead to inconsistent state if other transactions are happening concurrently that affect the balance of the contract.

2) Insufficient gas: The function execute() transfers tokens from the proposal.addr to the contract, which consumes gas. If the gas limit is not sufficient, the transaction may revert, causing unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is internal, which may restrict external access control and ownership verification mechanisms. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or control over the contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
