The contract to analyze:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    uint public price;
    bool public isPaid;

    constructor(address _seller, uint _price) {
        seller = _seller;
        price = _price;
    }

    function pay() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can pay");
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        isPaid = true;
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can release funds");
        require(isPaid, "Payment has not been made");
        payable(seller).transfer(address(this).balance); 
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
8) reentrancy
13) insufficient gas
14) incorrect visibility/ownership
