The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not provide any mechanism to ensure that this update is done atomically. This could potentially lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide any implementation for the required functions. This is an incorrect visibility/ownership issue as the contract should properly implement the interface functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
