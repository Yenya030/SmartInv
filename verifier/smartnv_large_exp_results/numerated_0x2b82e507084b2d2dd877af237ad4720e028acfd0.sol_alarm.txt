The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes unexpectedly.

2) Insufficient gas: Transferring tokens in the `execute()` function and querying token balances in the `endExecute()` function might require significant gas, potentially leading to out of gas issues.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `Proposal` struct is defined as internal, which might not be necessary and could potentially lead to issues with contract interaction.
