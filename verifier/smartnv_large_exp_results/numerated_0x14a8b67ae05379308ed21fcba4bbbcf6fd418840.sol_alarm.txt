The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Escrow {
     address public buyer;
     address public seller;
     uint public price;

     constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, uint _price) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        price = _price;
     }

     function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can deposit funds");
     }

     function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only the seller can release funds");
        require(address(this).balance >= price, "Not enough funds to release");
        
        seller.transfer(price);
     }

     function refundFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can refund funds");
        
        buyer.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }
}

Output: 
- The contract does not contain vulnerabilities. "Healthy"
