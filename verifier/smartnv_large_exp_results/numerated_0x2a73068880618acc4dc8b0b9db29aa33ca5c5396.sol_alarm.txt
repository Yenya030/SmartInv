The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which might not be the intended visibility level for an ownership variable.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially consume a considerable amount of gas due to the calculation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may lead to a potential gas issue.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, making it vulnerable to potential ID duplication issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and ID uniqueness violation.
