The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility: The functions `calculatePrice` and `liquidate` are public, which might expose sensitive operations publicly.
- Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function (`getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`) might result in arithmetic errors if not carefully handled.
- Insufficient gas: The `liquidate` function might require a significant amount of gas due to the potential token transfers, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
