The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw where the liquidation condition (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount) can potentially be manipulated by an attacker.

2) Ether leakage: There is no explicit mechanism in the contract to handle unexpected ETH transfers, which can lead to ether leakage vulnerabilities.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables in the contract is not specified, which can lead to incorrect usage or unauthorized access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, ether leakage, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
