Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() increases the votedAmount of the proposal without checking if the address is valid or if the amount is within a reasonable range, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not be intended and could lead to incorrect ownership assignment or manipulation. 

Output: Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership
