The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the struct 'Proposal', which may lead to potential data exposure.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is updated directly in the 'execute' function without proper synchronization, leading to possible inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may fail to execute if there is not enough gas provided to complete the operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no guarantee of uniqueness for the 'proposal.addr', which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
5) Privilege escalation: The 'startExecute' function can be called by any external account, allowing potential privilege escalation issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- ID uniqueness violation
- Privilege escalation
