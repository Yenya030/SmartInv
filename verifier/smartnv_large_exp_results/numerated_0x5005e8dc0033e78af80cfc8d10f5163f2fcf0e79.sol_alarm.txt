Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `startingBalanceList` after assigning the `proposal` struct. This can lead to inconsistent state if an error occurs between these two steps.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the `owner` variable. Depending on the intended functionality, this could potentially be a vulnerability.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks the balance of the contract against the total supply of the `votingToken`. If the gas provided for this operation is insufficient, it may fail and the contract could be left in an inconsistent state.
