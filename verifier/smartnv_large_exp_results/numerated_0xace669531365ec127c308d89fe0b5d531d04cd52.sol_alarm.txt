Contract:
```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public payee;
    uint public amount;
    bool public payed;
    
    constructor(address _payer, address _payee, uint _amount) {
        payer = _payer;
        payee = _payee;
        amount = _amount;
        payed = false;
    }
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can deposit funds");
        require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect amount deposited");
    }
    
    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == payee, "Only payee can release funds");
        require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance in contract");
        payee.transfer(amount);
        payed = true;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
