The contract you provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSale {
    address public admin;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    uint public totalTokens;
    mapping(address => uint) public tokenBalances;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
        totalTokens = _totalTokens;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _numTokens * tokenPrice, "Incorrect amount sent");

        tokenBalances[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
        totalTokens -= _numTokens;

        address(this).transfer(msg.value);
    }

    function withdrawTokens() public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Unauthorized access");

        uint tokensToWithdraw = tokenBalances[msg.sender];
        token.transfer(msg.sender, tokensToWithdraw);
        tokenBalances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The withdrawTokens function should have the onlyOwner modifier to ensure that only the admin can withdraw tokens. Without this check, anyone can call this function and withdraw tokens.
2) Inconsistent state update: The totalTokens variable is being updated in the buyTokens function without proper checking for available tokens, which may lead to an inconsistent state where more tokens are sold than available.
3) Ether leakage: The address(this).transfer(msg.value) statement in the buyTokens function can potentially lead to ether leakage if the transfer fails, leaving tokens unpaid for.
4) Insufficient gas: If the buyTokens function is called with a large number of tokens, the gas required for the function execution may exceed the gas limit, resulting in insufficient gas error during execution.
5) Business logic flaw: There is a lack of validation to ensure that enough tokens are available for purchase in the buyTokens function, which could lead to unexpected behavior when purchasing tokens.
