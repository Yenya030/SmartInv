The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which can lead to potential privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` state without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent states.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple instances where arithmetic operations are performed on unsigned integers without proper checks for potential overflow/underflow, such as in the `liquidate` function.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Integer overflow/underflow
