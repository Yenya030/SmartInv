The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The `execute` function allows the `votedAmount` to be incremented without proper verification, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not specified with appropriate visibility, potentially exposing sensitive data to external manipulation.
