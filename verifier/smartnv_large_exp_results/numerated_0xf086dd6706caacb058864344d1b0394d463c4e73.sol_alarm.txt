Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas limits for its functions, which can lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility or ownership modifiers for its state variables, which can lead to unintended data exposure or manipulation.
3) inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
4) atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes that are not wrapped in a single transaction, potentially leading to intermediate inconsistent states.
5) integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations in the contract that involve arithmetic operations without proper overflow/underflow checks, which can result in unexpected behavior.
6) reentrancy: The contract interacts with external contracts without implementing proper reentrancy guards, leaving it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
