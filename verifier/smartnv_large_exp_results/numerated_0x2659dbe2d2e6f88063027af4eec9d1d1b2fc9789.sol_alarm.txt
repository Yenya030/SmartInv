Contract to be analyzed:

contract TokenSale {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function buyTokens() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0);
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is public, making it accessible to everyone. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation if an attacker is able to manipulate the 'owner' address.
2) Insufficient gas: In the withdraw function, transferring the contract balance to the owner using 'payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance)' could fail if the gas limit is exceeded, resulting in funds being stuck in the contract. 
3) Integer overflow/underflow: The 'balances' mapping is susceptible to integer overflow if a user repeatedly buys tokens, leading to unexpected behavior or loss of funds.
