The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable without ensuring that it is properly protected against reentrancy, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the required functions or state variables, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.
