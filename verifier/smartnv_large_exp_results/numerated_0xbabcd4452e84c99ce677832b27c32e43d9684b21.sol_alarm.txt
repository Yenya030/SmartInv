The following contract may contain potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of functions which can lead to accessibility vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the contract may become inconsistent in the endExecute function if the condition for execution failed is not properly checked.
3) Insufficient gas: If the endExecute function requires a large amount of gas to execute, there might be a risk of running out of gas and the function failing.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique IDs in the Proposal struct, which could lead to potential conflicts or errors.
5) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes and operations in the execute function that could lead to atomicity violations if not properly handled.
6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions, but if ether is sent to the contract address, it could lead to ether leakage vulnerabilities.
7) Business logic flaw: The logic in the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions might be susceptible to business logic flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors.
