Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` modifies the state variable `lockedFunds` without considering potential reentrancy issues, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks the balance of the contract and may potentially fail if not enough gas is provided to cover the execution cost of the contract.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables `owner` and `votingToken`, which may lead to potential accessibility and ownership control issues.
