The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function, but there is no mechanism to ensure that this update is consistent with the overall state of the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct is internal, which may lead to potential visibility issues or ownership concerns in the contract.
