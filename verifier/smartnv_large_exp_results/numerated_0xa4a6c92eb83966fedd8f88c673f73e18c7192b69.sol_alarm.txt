Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct, but the variable `proposal` is not defined within the function scope, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for executing functions, the operations in the `endExecute` function, particularly `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, may consume a large amount of gas and potentially lead to running out of gas before the function completes.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract states that it implements the `IERC20` interface, but the interface definition is missing from the code snippet provided. This could lead to errors or unintended behavior if the interface is not correctly implemented according to the standard.

4) Reentrancy: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable after transferring tokens, which may open up the contract to reentrancy attacks if any external calls are made after the state update. 

5) Unauthorized access: There are no access control mechanisms implemented in the contract, allowing anyone to call the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions, which may lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of contract state. 

6) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount` in the `liquidate` function may result in integer overflow/underflow or precision errors depending on the values of `cAmount`, `dAmount`, and the result of `getPrice()`.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, reentrancy, unauthorized access, and arithmetic flaw.
