The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the voter has enough balance to transfer the required amount of tokens.
2) Business logic flaw: The condition in the `endExecute` function check might not accurately reflect the intended logic.
