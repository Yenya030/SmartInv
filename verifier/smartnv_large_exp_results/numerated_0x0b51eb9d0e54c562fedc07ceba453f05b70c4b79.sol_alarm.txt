Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The function `endExecute()` does not properly check for successful execution based on the balance comparison, which may lead to incorrect outcomes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but it doesn't define the required functions of the interface, which could lead to unexpected behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect these functions to be present.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no clear mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are created simultaneously by different users.
4) Atomicity violation: The operations within the functions may not be atomic, potentially leading to inconsistent state changes in case of unexpected events interrupting the process.
