The contract you provided <\example_3\> is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) business logic flaw: The function startExecute() initializes the proposal without checking if there is already an existing proposal. This can lead to multiple proposals being started simultaneously, causing confusion and potentially unwanted behavior.
2) inconsistent state update: The function execute() increments the votedAmount of the proposal without properly updating the state of the contract. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state and unexpected behavior.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal identifiers. This can lead to conflicts and discrepancies when managing multiple proposals.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the proposal struct and other variables, which can lead to accessibility and ownership issues. 

Overall, the contract <\example_3\> contains the identified potential vulnerabilities.
