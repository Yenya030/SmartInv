The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Business logic flaw: In the `endExecute` function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` might lead to incorrect state updates and could potentially disrupt the execution of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` variable and the `startingBalanceList` mapping are declared as internal, which may pose a risk if the intended visibility was meant to be private.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of ID uniqueness violation as the `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier to distinguish between different proposals.

4) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the state updates involve the `proposal.votedAmount` and the `votedProposal` function, which might lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled carefully.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas limit for certain operations, which may result in insufficient gas for desired function execution.

6) Suicide contracts: There is no protective mechanism in place to prevent the contract from being "suicided" (self-destructed) maliciously.

So the vulnerabilities in the contract are a business logic flaw, incorrect visibility/ownership, ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and potential risk of suicide contracts.
