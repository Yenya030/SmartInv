The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute that update the state of the proposal struct in different states. Ensuring consistency in state updates is crucial to prevent unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public, external, internal, private) for the functions startExecute, execute, endExecute, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities related to unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may face issues related to gas consumption in transactions as there are multiple state updates and token transfers happening within the same functions. This can potentially lead to out-of-gas exceptions.
