Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state of the proposal in the `execute()` function by incrementing the `votedAmount` without checking for reentrancy, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute()` function updates the `proposal` struct without any access control or visibility modifier, potentially allowing unauthorized access to start a new proposal.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function checks for the balance of the contract, which may require a significant amount of gas if the contract holds a large number of tokens, leading to gas exhaustion issues.
