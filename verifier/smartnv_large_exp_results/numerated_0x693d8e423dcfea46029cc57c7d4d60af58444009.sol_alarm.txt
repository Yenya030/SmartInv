The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The startExecute function updates the proposal state without ensuring proper synchronization with other functions that interact with the proposal.
2) Atomicity violation: The execute function attempts to transfer tokens and update the state without ensuring that the entire operation is atomic and cannot be interrupted.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the proposal struct, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of its data.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves a potentially expensive computation (calculating balance comparisons) which may consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
