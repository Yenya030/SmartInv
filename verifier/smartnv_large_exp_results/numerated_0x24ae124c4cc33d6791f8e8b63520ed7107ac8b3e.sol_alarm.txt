Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without properly handling concurrent calls or re-entrancy scenarios. This can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the code snippet but not provided, which may cause issues related to visibility and ownership control of functions.
3) Atomicity violation: As the contract involves multiple state changes in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`), there is a potential risk of atomicity violation, where intermediate states could be exposed due to external interference.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limits explicitly, which may result in transactions running out of gas and failing midway through, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
