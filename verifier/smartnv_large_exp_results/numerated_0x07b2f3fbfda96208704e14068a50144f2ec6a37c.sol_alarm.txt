The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that an address can only vote once, leading to the possibility of multiple votes from the same address.
2) Inconsistent state update: The totalVotes variable is updated without any restrictions, allowing for potential manipulation of the total vote count.
