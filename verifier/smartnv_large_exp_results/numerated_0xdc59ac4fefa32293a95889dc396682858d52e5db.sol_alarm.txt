The contract for analysis:
contract SwapTokens {
         IERC20 public tokenA;
         IERC20 public tokenB;
         
         function swap(uint amountA, uint amountB) public {
             require(amountA > 0 && amountB > 0, "Invalid swap amounts");
             
             tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
             tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);
             
             tokenA.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
             tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountA);
         }
     }
     
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not have proper checks for state updates after transfers, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the swap function due to multiple transfers, causing the transaction to revert.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and ownership of tokens may not be properly handled, leading to potential vulnerabilities in access control.
