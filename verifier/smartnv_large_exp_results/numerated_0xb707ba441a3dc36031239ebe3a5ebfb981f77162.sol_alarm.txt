Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract's endExecute function updates the state of lockedFunds without any proper checks or validation, which may lead to inconsistent or incorrect state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute function performs multiple state-changing operations without using any form of atomicity, which may result in unexpected behavior or vulnerability to reentrancy attacks.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the owner variable, which may lead to potential issues regarding ownership control and access control. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
