Contract analysis:
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the Proposal struct directly, which could lead to inconsistent state if there are multiple transactions trying to modify the same Proposal at the same time.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which might not be the intended visibility level for this variable, leading to potential ownership control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a gas-intensive operation by checking if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The execute function does not specify any specific visibility level (public, external, internal, private), which could lead to unexpected behavior and potential ownership control issues.

Output: 
Inconsistent state update
Incorrect visibility/ownership
Insufficient gas
