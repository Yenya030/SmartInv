The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable "proposal" is being updated in the "startExecute" and "execute" functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state and unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct is not declared as public or internal, which can potentially lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of its data.
