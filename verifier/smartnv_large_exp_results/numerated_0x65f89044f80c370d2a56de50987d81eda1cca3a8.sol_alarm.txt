Contract to be analyzed:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public totalVotes;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed");
        require(voters[msg.sender].voted == false, "You have already voted");

        voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;
        voters[to].weight += voters[msg.sender].weight;
    }

    function vote(uint256 option) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].voted == false, "You have already voted");
        require(option < 5, "Invalid voting option");

        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = option;
        totalVotes += voters[msg.sender].weight;
    }
}

Output:
- Inconsistent state update: The weight of the delegate should be decreased when a voter delegates their vote to someone else, but the code only increases the delegate's weight without decreasing the previous delegate's weight.
- Business logic flaw: There is no mechanism to prevent multiple votes from the same address. The contract should enforce only one vote per address.
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of the delegate address, allowing multiple voters to delegate their votes to the same address. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The voters mapping is public, exposing sensitive information such as voting status, delegate address, and vote choice to anyone. Consider changing the visibility to internal or private for better security.
