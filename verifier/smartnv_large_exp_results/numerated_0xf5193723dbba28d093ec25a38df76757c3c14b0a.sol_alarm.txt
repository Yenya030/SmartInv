The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains multiple state variables such as `proposal.sTime`, `proposal.votedAmount`, and `startingBalanceList`, which are updated at different points in the code without ensuring consistency across all updates.

2) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes happening within the `execute` function, such as transferring tokens and updating `proposal.votedAmount`, without atomic operations to ensure all changes happen together or none at all.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a complex calculation within the `require` statement, which could potentially require more gas than available in certain scenarios, leading to the function failing midway.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but does not provide any implementations for the required functions, potentially leading to issues with contract interactions or ownership.
