The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update:
   - The `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` is updated without checking if the `proposal` struct has been initialized, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The `votingToken` variable is not specified with any access control modifier, making it public by default, which can lead to potential security risks.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The `endExecute` function checks for the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` which might require substantial gas to execute and could potentially lead to running out of gas.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
