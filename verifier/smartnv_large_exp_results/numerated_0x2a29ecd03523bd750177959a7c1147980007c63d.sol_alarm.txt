Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) `ID uniqueness violation` - There are no mechanisms in place to ensure that IDs or addresses are unique, potentially leading to conflicts or unauthorized access. 
2) `Incorrect visibility/ownership` - The visibility and ownership of functions and variables are not specified, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical functions.
