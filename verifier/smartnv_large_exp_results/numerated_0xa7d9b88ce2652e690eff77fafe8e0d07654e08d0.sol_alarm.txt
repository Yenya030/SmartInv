Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any mechanism to ensure atomicity of the update, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility (public/private/internal) of the variables "lockedFunds" and "startingBalanceList", which can lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, the execution of functions like "execute" and "endExecute" that involve token transfers might run out of gas, causing the transactions to revert unexpectedly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas.
