Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is updated directly in the 'execute' function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is declared as an internal variable, potentially exposing it to manipulation by external contracts or attackers.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function could potentially run out of gas if the condition 'votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()' consumes a large amount of gas.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The 'proposal' struct does not have a unique identifier, which may lead to conflicts or errors in tracking proposals.
5) Atomicity violation: The 'execute' function first transfers tokens in 'votingToken.transferFrom' and then updates the 'proposal.votedAmount', which can lead to atomicity violations if the transfer fails after the amount is updated.
6) Business logic flaw: The condition in the 'endExecute' function 'votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()' seems problematic as it compares the balance to twice the total supply.
