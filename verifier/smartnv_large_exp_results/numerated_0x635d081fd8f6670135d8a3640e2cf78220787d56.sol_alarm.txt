The contract below contains the potential vulnerabilities: 

- Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not have explicit checks for potential integer overflows or underflows when performing arithmetic operations. 

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: Some functions in the contract may have public visibility when they should be restricted to only be called by specific entities.

- Insufficient gas: The contract may run into issues if there's insufficient gas supplied for certain operations, leading to unexpected behavior.

- Inconsistent state update: The contract's state may be inconsistently updated in certain functions, leading to unexpected results.

- Business logic flaw: There may be potential flaws in the contract's business logic that could be exploited.

- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transfers securely and may be vulnerable to ether leakage.
