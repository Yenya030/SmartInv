The potential vulnerabilities in contract TokenSale are:

4) Inconsistent state update: The tokensSold variable is updated without proper checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state of the contract.
8) Reentrancy: The buyTokens function does a token transfer before updating the state, which could allow for reentrancy attacks.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to privileged functions.
