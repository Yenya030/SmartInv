The potential vulnerabilities in the contract could be:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using atomic operations, which can lead to race conditions and incorrect values.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which might not be the intended visibility level for this variable.

4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit, the operations in the `endExecute()` function might fail due to insufficient gas to complete the required calculations and transfers.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to unexpected behavior if duplicate IDs are used.
