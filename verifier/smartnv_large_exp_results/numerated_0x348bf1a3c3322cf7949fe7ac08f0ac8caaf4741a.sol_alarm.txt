Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide any of the required functions, making it incompatible with the interface.
- Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent data.
- Insufficient gas: The function endExecute may fail if the gas limit is reached while trying to execute the required logic, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
