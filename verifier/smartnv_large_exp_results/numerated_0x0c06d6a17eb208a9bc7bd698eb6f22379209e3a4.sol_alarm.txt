The contract you are going to analyze:

contract Marketplace {
     address public admin;
     mapping (uint => address) public products;
     mapping (address => uint) public productOwnership;

     modifier onlyAdmin() {
         require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can call this function");
         _;
     }

     function addProduct(address product, uint id) public onlyAdmin {
         products[id] = product;
         productOwnership[product] = id;
     }

     function buyProduct(uint id) public payable {
         address product = products[id];
         require(msg.value >= 1 ether, "Insufficient payment");
         product.transfer(msg.value);
         productOwnership[msg.sender] = id;
     }
}
Correct output: 

ID uniqueness violation
