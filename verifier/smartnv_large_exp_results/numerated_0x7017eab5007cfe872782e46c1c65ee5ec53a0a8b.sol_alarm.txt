The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSwap {
         IERC20 public token1;
         IERC20 public token2;

         function swap(address user, uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
             token1.transferFrom(user, address(this), amount1);
             token2.transferFrom(address(this), user, amount2);
         }
 }

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle the scenario where the transfer of one token succeeds, but the transfer of the other token fails, leading to an inconsistent state.
- Insufficient gas: If the tokens involved in the transfer require a high amount of gas, the contract may run out of gas during the execution of the swap function.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The token1 and token2 variables are declared as public, which may expose sensitive information about the tokens to unauthorized parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
