The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define all required functions. This could lead to issues with the contract's functionality and could potentially affect its ownership.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which may result in inconsistent state updates.

3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions properly, which may lead to unintended ether leakage.

4) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the `startExecute` function to be called externally, which may lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider gas limitations in its functions, which may result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas.

6) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations without checking for potential integer overflow/underflow, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

7) Atomicity violation: The contract does not utilize atomic operations, which may result in race condition vulnerabilities.

8) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute` function may be susceptible to business logic flaws, as it compares the balance of the contract against the total token supply without clear reasoning.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Ether leakage
- Privilege escalation
- Insufficient gas
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Atomicity violation
- Business logic flaw
