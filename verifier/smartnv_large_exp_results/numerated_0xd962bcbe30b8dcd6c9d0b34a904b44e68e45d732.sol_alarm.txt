Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that the proposal ID or user ID is unique, which could lead to conflicts or errors in tracking proposals or users.
2) Inconsistent state update: The logic for updating the proposal state in the `execute` function is not atomic, as the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated before calling `votedProposal(proposal)`, which may lead to inconsistent state updates under certain conditions. 
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It's not clear if the `votingToken` is properly owned or accessible only by authorized parties, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the voting token.
