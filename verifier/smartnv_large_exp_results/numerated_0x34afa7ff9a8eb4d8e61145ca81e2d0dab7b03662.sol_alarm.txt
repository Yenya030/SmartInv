Based on the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, without considering any validation or restrictions on this update.

2) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for the transactions, the execution of certain functions within the contract may fail due to insufficient gas provided.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
