Contract to be analyzed:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    mapping(address => uint) public numVotes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        numVotes[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function changeVote() public {
        require(hasVoted[msg.sender], "Hasn't voted yet");
        numVotes[msg.sender]--;
        totalVotes--;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = false;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract doesn't ensure the uniqueness of voter addresses, which could lead to improper vote counting or manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for changing a vote without verifying the original vote, which may result in incorrect vote tally.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables are public, allowing anyone to access and potentially manipulate the data. This could lead to unauthorized changes in the voting system.
4) Suicidal contracts: There are no checks to prevent the contract from self-destructing, which could result in the loss of all data stored in the contract.
5) Insufficient gas: The contract operations might consume more gas than provided, causing transaction failures or contract operations to be incomplete.

Output: ID uniqueness violation, Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Suicidal contracts, Insufficient gas.
