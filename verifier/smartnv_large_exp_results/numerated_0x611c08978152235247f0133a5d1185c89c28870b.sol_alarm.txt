The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` transfers tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract before updating the `proposal.votedAmount`. If the token transfer fails after the tokens are withdrawn from `proposal.addr`, it could result in atomicity violation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but it does not provide any implementation for the required functions specified in the interface. This could be an incorrect visibility issue.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Atomicity violation
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
