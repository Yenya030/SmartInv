The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    function vote(uint _numTokens) public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted.");
        votes[msg.sender] = _numTokens;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function getTotalVotes() public view returns (uint) {
        uint total = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < msg.sender.balance; i++) {
            total += votes[msg.sender];
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerability in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The loop in the `getTotalVotes` function could result in an integer overflow if `msg.sender.balance` is very large.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `votes` and `hasVoted` mappings are public, which exposes sensitive data to anyone.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `hasVoted` mapping is not updated in the `vote` function before updating the `votes` mapping, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
4) Atomicity violation: The `vote` function is not atomic, meaning that multiple transactions could modify the state of `hasVoted` and `votes` simultaneously.
5) Insufficient gas: The loop in the `getTotalVotes` function could consume too much gas, causing the function to fail in case of high values of `msg.sender.balance`.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Atomicity violation
- Insufficient gas
