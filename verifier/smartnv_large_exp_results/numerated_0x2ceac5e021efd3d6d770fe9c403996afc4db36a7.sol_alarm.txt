Contract Analysis: 

The contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the "proposal" struct is being updated in the "startExecute" and "execute" functions without proper synchronization or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function performs a check for the balance of the contract, but if the gas limit is insufficient, this check may not be executed successfully, leading to potential issues.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the "proposal" struct, and it is unclear who has ownership or control over the proposal and its related data.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities that need further review and assessment to ensure the security and functionality of the system.
