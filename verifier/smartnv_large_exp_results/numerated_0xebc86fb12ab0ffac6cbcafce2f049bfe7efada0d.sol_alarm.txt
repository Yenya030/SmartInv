Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `makePayment` function should have appropriate access control to ensure that only the payer can initiate the payment. Without proper access control, anyone can potentially trigger the payment.
- Atomicity violation: If the `updateAmount` function is called between the check of the `require` statement and the actual transfer of funds in the `makePayment` function, it can lead to an atomicity violation where the payment is made with an incorrect amount.
