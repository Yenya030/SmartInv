The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function execute(uint256 amount) updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas:
   - The function endExecute() involves a calculation that may require a significant amount of gas, which could lead to out-of-gas error during execution.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not provide the required function signatures, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues with the interface implementation.
