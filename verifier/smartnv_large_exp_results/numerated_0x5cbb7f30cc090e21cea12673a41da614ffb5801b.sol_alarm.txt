Contract to be analyzed: 

<\contract\>
contract Escrow {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
<\contract\>

Output:
- Privilege escalation
- Ether leakage
