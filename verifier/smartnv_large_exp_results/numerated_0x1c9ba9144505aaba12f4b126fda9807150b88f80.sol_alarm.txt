The contract to analyze:

contract PaymentChannel {
    address public payer;
    address public payee;
    uint public amount;
    bool public isOpen;

    constructor(address _payer, address _payee, uint _amount) {
        payer = _payer;
        payee = _payee;
        amount = _amount;
        isOpen = true;
    }

    function closeChannel() public {
        require(msg.sender == payer || msg.sender == payee, "only payer or payee can close the channel");
        isOpen = false;
    }

    function settle() public {
        require(!isOpen, "channel is still open");
        require(address(this).balance == amount, "incorrect amount sent");
        payee.transfer(amount);
    }
}
