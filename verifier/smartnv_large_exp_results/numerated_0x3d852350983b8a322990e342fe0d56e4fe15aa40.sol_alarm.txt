The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Vault {
    mapping(address => uint) private balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Insufficient gas
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
