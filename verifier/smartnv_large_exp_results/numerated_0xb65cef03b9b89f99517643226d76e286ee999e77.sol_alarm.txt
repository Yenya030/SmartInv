Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function is updating the `votedAmount` of the `proposal` without proper synchronization checks. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than available due to the transfer operations, leading to a transaction failure.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which may expose it to potential visibility issues. In addition, the ownership of certain functions and variables is not clearly defined, which could lead to security risks.
