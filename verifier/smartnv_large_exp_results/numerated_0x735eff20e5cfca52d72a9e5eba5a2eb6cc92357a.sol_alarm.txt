Supected vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are updated in the `liquidate` function without proper checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function (`getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100`) could potentially result in an arithmetic flaw if the values are not properly validated beforehand.
