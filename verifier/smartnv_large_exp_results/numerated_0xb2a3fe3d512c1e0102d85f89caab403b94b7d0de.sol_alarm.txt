The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify access control for certain functions, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive operations.
2) Atomicity violation: The `endExecute` function does multiple state changes without ensuring that they all succeed or fail together, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` without proper synchronization, which could lead to incorrect state updates.
4) Ether leakage: There is a lack of proper handling of ether transactions, which could result in unintended loss of funds.
5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not account for potential gas limits in complex operations, which could result in transactions failing due to running out of gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
