Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseToSeller and releaseToBuyer functions can be called by anyone as they only require the arbiter's address to release funds. This may lead to unauthorized releases.
2) Inconsistent state update: If there is no check to ensure that only one of the release functions can be called, both functions could be called, resulting in double release of funds.
3) Insufficient gas: If the escrowAmount is extremely large, transferring the funds using transfer() may run out of gas and fail to complete the transfer.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks to ensure that the same addresses are not used for multiple roles (buyer, seller, arbiter) in different instances of the Escrow contract, which may lead to confusion and unintended consequences.
