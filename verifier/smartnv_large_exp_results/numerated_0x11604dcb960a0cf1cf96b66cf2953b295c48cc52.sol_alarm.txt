Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper validation or checks, which may result in inconsistent state updates.
3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to issues with data integrity.
4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity of the operations performed in the functions, there may be a risk of running out of gas during contract execution.
5) Missing access control: There is no implementation of access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users only, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation.
