The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without further validation or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract could potentially run out of gas if the `getPrice` function consumes a significant amount of gas, leading to the function being unable to complete its execution.

3) Arithmetic flaw: The arithmetic operation in the `liquidate` function could potentially lead to an arithmetic flaw if the calculation result exceeds the maximum integer value or if there are rounding errors. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and arithmetic flaw.
