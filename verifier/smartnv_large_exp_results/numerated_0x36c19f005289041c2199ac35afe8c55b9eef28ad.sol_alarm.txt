The potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the `proposal` struct, making it publicly accessible.
2) Reentrancy: The `execute` function transfers tokens before updating the state, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to complete the required operations.
5) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` in the `endExecute` function may have unintended consequences or may not accurately reflect the business logic of the contract.
