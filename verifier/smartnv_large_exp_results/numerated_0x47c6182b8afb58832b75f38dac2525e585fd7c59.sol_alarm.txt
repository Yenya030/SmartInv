Given contract:
contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function swap(uint amount, address recipient) public {
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        tokenB.transfer(recipient, amount);
    }

    function getPrice() public view returns (uint) {
        return tokenB.balanceOf(address(this)) / tokenA.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The swap function transfers tokens before updating the balance which could lead to inconsistent state if the transfer fails after the balance update.
2) Integer overflow/underflow:
- The calculation in getPrice() could result in integer underflow if the balance of tokenA is greater than the balance of tokenB leading to unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The ownership of the contract and visibility of functions could pose vulnerabilities if not properly managed and secured.
