The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20 but does not define the required functions. It should properly implement the required functions to adhere to the interface.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function in TimelockController updates the votedAmount in the Proposal struct directly without using the proposal variable. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions in the contract are missing visibility specifiers (public, private, internal, external), which can lead to unexpected behavior.
4) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function in TimelockController checks if the lockedFunds is greater than half the total supply of the votingToken, which might not be the correct logic for ending execution.
