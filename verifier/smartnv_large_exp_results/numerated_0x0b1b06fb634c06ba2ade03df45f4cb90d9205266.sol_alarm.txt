Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct directly, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple calls are made without proper synchronization.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not have the necessary functions defined, leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a large amount of gas to execute properly, which can lead to out-of-gas errors and unsuccessful execution.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential inconsistency issue with the operation between the internal and external proposal structures, leading to cross bridge inconsistency vulnerabilities.
