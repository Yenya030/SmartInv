This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: The execution of the `endExecute()` function does not reset the `proposal` state variable, allowing for potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to ownership control.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
