The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        balance += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
        balance -= amount;
    }

    function updateOwner(address newOwner) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```
