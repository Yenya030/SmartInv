Vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure that each Proposal struct has a unique identifier, which could lead to issues with data integrity and potential conflicts.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal state variables owner and startingBalanceList could be vulnerable if not properly controlled in terms of visibility and ownership, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
3) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is updated without any check for maximum limit or ensuring consistency, which could lead to unexpected behavior and misuse.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs multiple balance-related operations and checks, potentially consuming a large amount of gas and leading to out-of-gas errors.
5) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks for the total supply of votingToken being twice the balance of the contract, which may not be a valid business rule and can lead to unexpected outcomes.
