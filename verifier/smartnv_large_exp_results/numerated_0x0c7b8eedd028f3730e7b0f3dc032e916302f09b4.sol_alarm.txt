The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of a proposal without ensuring atomicity, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might fail to execute if the gas provided is not enough to cover the required gas cost for the operations inside the function.
