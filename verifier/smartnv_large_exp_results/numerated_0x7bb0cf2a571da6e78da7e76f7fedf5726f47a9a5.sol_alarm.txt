The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The contract is updating the proposal's votedAmount without using safe math operations, which could potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.

2) Atomicity violation:
- The execute function is transferring tokens and updating the proposal state variables without using proper atomicity checks, which could lead to inconsistencies if the execution fails midway.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but is missing the necessary functions to comply with the interface, such as transfer, transferFrom, and balanceOf, which could lead to incorrect visibility and ownership issues.
