Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility: The variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` are not specified with an explicit visibility (public, internal, private). This could lead to unintended access and manipulation of these variables by external contracts.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `votedAmount` of the `proposal` is updated directly without properly handling potential reentrancy issues, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially expensive operation by checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`. This could run out of gas and prevent the function from executing properly.
4) Incomplete state handling: There is no mechanism in place to cancel or revert a proposal if certain conditions are not met, such as in the `startExecute` or `execute` functions. This could leave the contract in an inconsistent state if conditions are not properly checked and handled.
