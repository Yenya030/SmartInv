The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state of the contract by setting the `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList`, but there is no validation to prevent re-initialization of an existing proposal, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Reentrancy: The `execute()` function calls `votingToken.transferFrom()`, which can potentially trigger external contract calls. If the external contract calls back into the `execute()` function before it completes, it can lead to a reentrancy vulnerability.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function calculates the `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, but there is no check for available gas to perform the operation. If the gas limit is too low, the operation may fail due to insufficient gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, reentrancy, and insufficient gas.
