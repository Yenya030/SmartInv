Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility: Functions startExecute, execute, endExecute should be marked as external to prevent privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of functions startExecute, execute, endExecute may lead to inconsistent state updates due to improper handling of proposal state changes.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require excessive gas due to the calculation of votingToken balances, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of ID uniqueness violation due to the lack of checks for duplicate proposal IDs.
