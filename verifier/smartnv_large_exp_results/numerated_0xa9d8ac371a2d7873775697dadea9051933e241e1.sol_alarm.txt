The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function, but the contract does not ensure that this update is done atomically with other operations, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: If the `execute` or `endExecute` functions require a large amount of gas, there is a risk that the transactions may run out of gas before completion, resulting in incomplete or failed execution.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions are all declared as `external`, which may expose sensitive functionality to external contracts. Consider using more restrictive visibility such as `internal` or `private` where appropriate. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
