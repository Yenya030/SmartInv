The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` mapping, but there is no provision to ensure that these updates are done atomically. If one update fails, the contract may end up in an inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract and compares it to the total token supply. If the balance check requires a large amount of gas, it may exceed the gas limit and cause the function to fail.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is defined as internal, which may allow external contracts or users to access and modify its data directly, potentially leading to unauthorized changes in the contract state. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
