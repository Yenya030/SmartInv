The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

contract MultiSigWallet {
     mapping(address => uint8) public owners; 
     uint constant public MAX_OWNER_COUNT = 50;
     uint public transactionCount; 
     mapping(uint => Transaction) public transactions;

     struct Transaction {
         address to;
         uint value;
         bytes data;
         bool executed;
     }

     function addOwner(address owner) public {
         require(owners[owner] == 0, "owner already exists");
         require(transactionCount == 0, "existing transactions in progress");
         owners[owner] = 1;
     }

     function removeOwner(address owner) public {
         require(owners[owner] == 1, "owner does not exist");
         require(transactionCount == 0, "existing transactions in progress");
         owners[owner] = 0;
     }

     function submitTransaction(address to, uint value, bytes memory data) public {
         require(owners[msg.sender] == 1, "sender is not an owner");
         transactions[transactionCount] = Transaction(to, value, data, false);
         transactionCount++;
     }

     function executeTransaction(uint transactionId) public {
         require(transactions[transactionId].executed == false, "transaction already executed");
         Transaction storage transaction = transactions[transactionId];
         transaction.executed = true;
         (bool success, ) = transaction.to.call{value: transaction.value}(transaction.data);
         require(success, "transaction failed");
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) inconsistent state update
2) reentrancy
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
