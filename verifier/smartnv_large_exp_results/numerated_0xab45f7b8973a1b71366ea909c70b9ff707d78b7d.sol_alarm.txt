Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without sufficient checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or incorrect data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ExchangeTokens contract does not explicitly define the access level (public, internal, external, private) for the debt and collateral mappings, which could result in unexpected access or ownership issues.
