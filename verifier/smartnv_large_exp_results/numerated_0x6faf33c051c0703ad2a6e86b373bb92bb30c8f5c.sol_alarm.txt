The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The modifiers and access control for functions and variables are not clearly defined, leaving the contract susceptible to unauthorized access or manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: The state variables like `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract may require more gas than provided, leading to transaction failures or incomplete execution.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations being performed without proper checks for overflow or underflow, which can result in unexpected outcomes or attacks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and integer overflow/underflow.
