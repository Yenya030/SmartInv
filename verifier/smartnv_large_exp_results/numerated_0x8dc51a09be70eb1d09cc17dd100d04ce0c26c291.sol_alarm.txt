The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'votedAmount' in the 'execute' function is updated directly without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is not marked as private, making it accessible externally which may lead to unauthorized changes to the proposal data.
3) Insufficient gas: The gas requirement for the 'execute' function is not considered, which may result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas.
4) Privilege escalation: The 'owner' variable is not used or updated throughout the contract, potentially leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability if it was meant to be utilized for access control.
