Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or any other entities, which could potentially lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions is not explicitly specified, leaving them potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access or manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas checks for certain operations, which could result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas or unexpected behavior.
4) Atomicity violation: Certain operations in the contract, such as the execution of proposals, may not be atomic, leading to inconsistent or incomplete state changes.
5) Business logic flaw: The implementation of the proposal system and execution process may contain flaws that could be exploited to manipulate outcomes or bypass intended restrictions.
