The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() does not reset the proposal state variables after execution, potentially allowing for unexpected behavior if the contract is reused.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not provide any implementation for the required functions. This could lead to issues with contract interactions relying on the interface.
3) Insufficient gas: The execution of the endExecute() function may require more gas than is available, leading to a failure in execution.
4) Business logic flaw: The conditional check in the function liquidate() may not properly reflect the intended logic for liquidation, potentially allowing for undesired outcomes.
