The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is no check for potential overflow/underflow when updating or setting the total price.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, and it should be private to prevent unauthorized access.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the `makePayment` function, which could result in the payment not being processed successfully.
