The contract in question may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute()` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring that it properly reflects the total transfer amount, which could lead to inconsistent states.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `address owner` variable is marked as `internal`, which may not provide the desired access restriction and could lead to unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function performs multiple operations that could consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
