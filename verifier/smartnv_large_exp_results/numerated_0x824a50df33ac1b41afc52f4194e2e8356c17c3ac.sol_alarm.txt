Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow if the value of highestBid gets too high.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function bid can potentially lead to inconsistent state if multiple bids come in simultaneously.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the bids mapping being public may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
