Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The functions `startExecute()`, `execute()`, and `endExecute()` update the state of the `proposal` struct without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent states.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but doesn't contain the required functions or state variables associated with ERC20 tokens. This could lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities related to token interactions.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function performs a potentially expensive operation with the `require` statement `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`. This could lead to insufficient gas issues if the gas limit is reached during execution.

4) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function lacks proper synchronization mechanisms when updating the `proposal.votedAmount` variable, which could lead to atomicity violations and potential vulnerabilities.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations involving the `proposal.votedAmount` variable in the `execute()` function that could potentially lead to integer overflow if not handled properly.

6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have proper mechanisms to ensure the uniqueness of identifiers for proposals or other entities, which could lead to ID collision vulnerabilities.

7) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users, potentially leading to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
