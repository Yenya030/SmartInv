Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not ensure consistent state updates in functions like `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute`. There might be scenarios where state changes are not properly coordinated, leading to unexpected behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas limits for executing certain functions, which may result in out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or addresses used in proposals or other structures, which could lead to data conflicts or incorrect function executions.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables like `proposal` or functions like `votedProposal`, potentially exposing them to unwanted access or modification.

5) Price manipulation: The contract uses certain balances or values like `startingBlance` without appropriate checks or safeguards, making it susceptible to price manipulation vulnerabilities.

6) Business logic flaw: The contract lacks comprehensive and thorough business logic checks, which could introduce vulnerabilities related to the validity and integrity of transactions or proposals.
