Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is updated without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the required functions and variables, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates and incorrect visibility/ownership.
