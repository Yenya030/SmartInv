The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any further checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state if not properly managed.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20`, but it doesn't provide any implementation for the required functions, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership concerns. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
