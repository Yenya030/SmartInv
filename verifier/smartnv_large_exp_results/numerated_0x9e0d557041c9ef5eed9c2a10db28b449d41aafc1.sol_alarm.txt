The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable in the "endExecute" function is updated without considering any reentrancy issues, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are several arithmetic operations in the contract that involve adding and subtracting amounts, which could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions in the contract is not explicitly specified, which could lead to unexpected access control issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
