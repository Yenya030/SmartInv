This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or any other entities, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not explicitly specified, which could lead to unexpected access or ownership issues.

3) inconsistent state update: There are instances where state variables are updated without proper synchronization or validation, which could result in inconsistent data state.

4) insufficient gas: The execution of certain functions may require more gas than what is provided, leading to incomplete or failed transactions.

5) arithmetic flaw: There are arithmetic calculations that could potentially result in overflow or underflow issues if not properly handled.
