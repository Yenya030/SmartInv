The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" statement in the execute function could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions modify the same proposal concurrently.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could result in integer overflow/underflow, such as in the "startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);" statement in the startExecute function.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables "lockedFunds" and "startingBalanceList" are not defined in the contract, and their visibility and ownership are unclear, which could lead to potential issues.

Therefore, the contract contains potential vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
