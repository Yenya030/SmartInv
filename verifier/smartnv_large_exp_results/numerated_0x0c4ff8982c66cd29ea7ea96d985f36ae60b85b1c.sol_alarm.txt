Contract you are going to analyze:

contract Market {
        address public owner;
        uint public price;
        
        constructor() {
            owner = msg.sender;
            price = 100;
        }
        
        function updatePrice(uint _newPrice) public {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update price");
            price = _newPrice;
        }
        
        function buy() public payable {
            require(msg.value >= price, "Insufficient funds to buy");
            // Functionality to complete the purchase
        }
        
        function withdraw() public {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
            // Functionality to withdraw funds
        }
}
