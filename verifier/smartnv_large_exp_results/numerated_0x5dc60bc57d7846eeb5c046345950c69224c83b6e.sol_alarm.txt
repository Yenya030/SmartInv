The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;
    mapping(address => uint) public deposits;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = _amount;
    }

    function deposit(address party) public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0");
        deposits[party] += msg.value;
    }

    function releaseFunds(address party) public {
        require(party == buyer || party == seller || party == arbiter, "Unauthorized party");
        require(deposits[party] >= amount, "Insufficient deposit amount");
        payable(party).transfer(amount);
    }

    function refundFunds(address party) public {
        require(party == buyer || party == seller || party == arbiter, "Unauthorized party");
        require(deposits[party] >= amount, "Insufficient deposit amount");
        deposits[party] -= amount;
        payable(party).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are as follows:
1) No input validation for the party parameter in releaseFunds and refundFunds functions
2) Lack of authorization check before transferring funds in releaseFunds and refundFunds functions
