The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute update the state of the proposal struct without proper synchronization and could lead to inconsistent or unexpected state changes, especially in a scenario where multiple transactions are being processed simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the struct Proposal, which can lead to potential access control issues and unauthorized modifications of proposal data.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may run out of gas during the execution, especially when checking for the condition require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()), which can result in the function failing to complete successfully.
4) Atomicity violation: The execute function transfers tokens and updates the votedAmount in multiple steps, which could potentially lead to a situation where the operation is not completed successfully due to an interruption or failure after transferring tokens but before updating votedAmount.
