The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for the update of state variables (such as votedAmount and lockedFunds) in multiple functions without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent or unexpected state changes.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables owner, votingToken, proposal, and startingBalanceList, which can make them susceptible to unintended access or manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a gas-intensive operation by calculating the balance of the contract multiple times, which could lead to insufficient gas for the transaction to be completed successfully.

4) Business logic flaw: The execute function allows for the transfer of tokens without properly checking the availability of funds or verifying voter eligibility, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities found in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Insufficient gas, and Business logic flaw.
