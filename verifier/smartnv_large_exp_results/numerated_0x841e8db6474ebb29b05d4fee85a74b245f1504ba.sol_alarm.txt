Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute` function is being updated without proper synchronization or atomicity check, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of the `votedProposal` function is not specified, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function executes multiple require statements and calculates the balance of tokens, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
