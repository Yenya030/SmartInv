Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are declared with internal visibility, which may unintentionally expose them to external contracts. 
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated within the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization mechanisms, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute if there is not enough gas provided for the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
