The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of `votingToken`, but there is no synchronization mechanism to ensure that the balance is accurately reflected at that moment.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` implements the `IERC20` interface but does not define all the required functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

3) Reentrancy: There are no checks in place to prevent reentrancy attacks in the `execute` function where `votingToken.transferFrom` is called before updating the `proposal.votedAmount`, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit this order of operations.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and reentrancy.
