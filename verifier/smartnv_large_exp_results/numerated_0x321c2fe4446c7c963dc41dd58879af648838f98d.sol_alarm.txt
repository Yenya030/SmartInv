Contract to be analyzed:

contract EscrowContract {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;

    enum State { Created, Locked, Released, Inactive }
    State public state;

    modifier onlyBuyer() {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can call this function");
        _;
    }

    modifier onlySeller() {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can call this function");
        _;
    }

    modifier inState(State _state) {
        require(state == _state, "Invalid state");
        _;
    }

    constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter) {
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        state = State.Created;
    }

    function deposit(address _buyer) public payable {
        require(state == State.Created, "Invalid state");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Invalid amount");
        buyer = _buyer;
        amount = msg.value;
        state = State.Locked;
    }

    function release() public onlySeller inState(State.Locked) {
        seller.transfer(amount);
        state = State.Released;
    }

    function refund() public onlyBuyer inState(State.Locked) {
        buyer.transfer(amount);
        state = State.Released;
    }

    function dispute() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can call this function");
        state = State.Inactive;
    }
}

Output: potential vulnerabilities: 
1) No timeout mechanism for the escrow, leaving the funds locked indefinitely.
2) Lack of fee handling, potential for fee manipulation.
3) Not handling the case where the arbiter is unresponsive or biased in the dispute resolution process.
