Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is updated in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization or atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility control or ownership concerns.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential gas limitations in functions like `endExecute`, where it performs a potentially costly operation to check the balance, which could result in insufficient gas for the transaction.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to issues with duplicate or conflicting proposals.
