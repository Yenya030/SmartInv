The contract to analyze and identify potential vulnerabilities is as follows:

```solidity
contract Payment {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The balances can overflow if a huge amount is deposited, or underflow if a user tries to withdraw more than their balance.
2) Insufficient gas: If the contract balance gets too high, the withdrawal function may require more gas than available in a single transaction, leading to a failed withdrawal.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, potentially exposing sensitive information about users' balances to anyone.
4) Atomicity violation: The deposit and withdrawal operations are not done atomically, leading to potential inconsistencies in user balances.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether sent to it without calling a function, potentially locking it in the contract forever.
