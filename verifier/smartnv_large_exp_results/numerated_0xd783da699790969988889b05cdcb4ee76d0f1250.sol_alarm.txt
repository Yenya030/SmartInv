The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` are accessed without specifying their visibility (public, internal, private). This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of these variables by external contracts.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the transfer of tokens was successful. This could result in the state being inconsistently updated if the token transfer fails.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state-changing operations (token transfer, updating `proposal.votedAmount`, calling `votedProposal`) without using any mechanism to ensure that all operations are executed atomically. This could lead to unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails midway.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions properly, which could lead to Ether being trapped in the contract without any way to withdraw it.
