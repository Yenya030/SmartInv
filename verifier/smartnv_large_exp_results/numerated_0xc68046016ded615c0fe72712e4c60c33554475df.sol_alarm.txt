Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place to restrict privileged functionality to only authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute sensitive functions.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated throughout different functions without comprehensive checks or synchronization mechanisms to ensure consistency, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerability exploitation.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables are not clearly defined in the contract, which can lead to confusion and potential exploitation by malicious actors.
