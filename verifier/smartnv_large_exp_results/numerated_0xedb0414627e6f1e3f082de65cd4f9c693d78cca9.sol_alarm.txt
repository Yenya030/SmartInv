The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users or roles, potentially allowing unauthorized users to access and manipulate critical functions.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates `proposal.votedAmount` without any check for potential reentrant calls, leading to a risk of inconsistent state if reentrancy occurs.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations in the contract that could result in integer overflow or underflow, such as in the `liquidate` function of ExchangeTokens contract.
