Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call functions like execute and endExecute without proper authorization, leading to potential privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or atomicity, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership of functions and variables, making it prone to unauthorized access and manipulation.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a significant amount of gas to execute, potentially leading to out-of-gas exceptions or failed executions.
5) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount) may have arithmetic flaws or potential overflow/underflow issues, leading to incorrect results or vulnerabilities. 

Overall Assessment: The contract contains multiple vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure the security and correctness of its operations.
