Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is incremented in the "execute" function, but there is no check to ensure that the same proposal is not voted on multiple times, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks if the execution has ended and completes certain actions based on conditions. If the gas limit is reached before these actions can be completed, it may result in incomplete execution and potential vulnerabilities.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable and "lockedFunds" variable are not specified with a visibility keyword, leading to potential vulnerabilities in terms of access control and visibility.
