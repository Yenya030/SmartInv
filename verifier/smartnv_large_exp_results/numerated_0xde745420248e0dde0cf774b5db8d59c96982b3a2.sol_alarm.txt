The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect ownership visibility: The user variable is not marked as private, allowing potential manipulation of the user address.
2) Privilege escalation: There is a privilege escalation vulnerability as any user can call the deposit function if they know the user address and potentially deposit funds on behalf of the user.
3) Reentrancy: The withdraw function may be susceptible to reentrancy attacks if the user address is manipulated to repeatedly withdraw before updating the depositAmount to 0.
