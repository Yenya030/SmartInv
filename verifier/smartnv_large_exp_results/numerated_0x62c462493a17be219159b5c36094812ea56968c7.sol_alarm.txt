contract VotingSystem {

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There is potential for multiple votes to be cast by the same address.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `totalVotes` variable may not accurately reflect the total number of votes.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votes` mapping should ideally be restricted to only the owner or specific access control.
