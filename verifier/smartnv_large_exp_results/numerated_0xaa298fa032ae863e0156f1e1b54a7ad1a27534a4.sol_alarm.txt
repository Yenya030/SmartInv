Contract:

contract TokenSale {
    struct Sale {
        address buyer;
        uint amount;
    }
    
    mapping(uint => Sale) public sales;
    uint public totalSales;
    
    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount <= 100, "Exceeded maximum purchase amount");
        totalSales++;
        sales[totalSales] = Sale(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
    
    function refund(uint _saleId) public {
        require(msg.sender == sales[_saleId].buyer, "Only the buyer can request a refund");
        // refund logic
    }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
- Business logic flaw: The contract allows for unlimited purchases of tokens without any price setting mechanism or consideration of available token supply, which could lead to potential issues with token pricing and inflation.
- ID uniqueness violation: The sales are indexed by the total number of sales, which could lead to potential conflicts if multiple purchases happen simultaneously and share the same totalSales count.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The sales mapping is public, exposing sensitive buyer information to anyone who interacts with the contract.
- Insufficient gas: The refund function does not include any gas stipend, which could lead to potential out-of-gas errors during the refund process.
