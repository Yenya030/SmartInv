Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables and functions, which could lead to potential accessibility issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" state variable is being updated in the "endExecute" function without proper checks or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The operations within the "endExecute" function may consume a significant amount of gas, potentially resulting in out-of-gas errors.
4) Business logic flaw: The logic within the "endExecute" function, particularly the comparison "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()", could contain a business logic flaw that may lead to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities.
