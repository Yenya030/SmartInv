1) potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The balances mapping is not updated when tokens are sold, which could lead to incorrect data.
- Integer overflow/underflow: Multiplying _amount with tokenPrice in buyTokens and sellTokens functions could lead to overflow if _amount is too large.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is set as public, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the owner's address.
