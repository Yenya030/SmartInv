The contract to be analyzed:

contract Escrow {
         IERC20 public token;
         address public buyer;
         address public seller;
         address public arbiter;

         constructor(address _token, address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter) {
             token = IERC20(_token);
             buyer = _buyer;
             seller = _seller;
             arbiter = _arbiter;
         }

         function deposit(uint amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can deposit");
             token.transferFrom(buyer, address(this), amount);
         }

         function release(uint amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the seller or arbiter can release funds");
             token.transfer(seller, amount);
         }

         function refund(uint amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the buyer or arbiter can refund funds");
             token.transfer(buyer, amount);
         }
}

Output: 
1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The constructor should be marked as public for accessibility.
2) Insufficient Gas: All transfer functions should be checked for potential gas issues during execution.
