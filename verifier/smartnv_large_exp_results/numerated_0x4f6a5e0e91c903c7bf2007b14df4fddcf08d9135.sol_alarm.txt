The contract:
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
    }
    address internal owner;
    IERC20 votingToken;
    
    function startExecute() external {
        uint256 startingBlance;
        require(proposal.sTime == 0, "on-going proposal");
        proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
        startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
        startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 
    }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
        require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
        votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
        proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
        votedProposal(proposal); 
    }

    function endExecute() external {
        require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
        require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) * 2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
        lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'startingBalance' variable is misspelled as 'startingBlance' in the 'startExecute' function, which could lead to incorrect state updates.
2) Privilege escalation: The 'proposal' struct is being updated without proper access control or permission checks, potentially allowing unauthorized users to modify proposals.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are no checks for integer overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operations performed in the contract, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as 'internal', which could expose it to potential manipulation by external contracts or malicious users.
