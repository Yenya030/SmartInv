<\timelock_controller_contract\>
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable startingBlance is being updated incorrectly in the startExecute function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define all the required functions, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or vulnerabilities.

<\exchange_tokens_contract\>
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Price manipulation: The liquidate function calculates price based on the getPrice function, which can be manipulated to exploit the liquidation process.
2) Insufficient gas: The calculatePrice function requires a payable modifier but does not handle the received ether, potentially leading to gas depletion if it is invoked with ether.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The debt and collateral mappings are public, allowing anyone to access and potentially manipulate them, posing a security risk.
