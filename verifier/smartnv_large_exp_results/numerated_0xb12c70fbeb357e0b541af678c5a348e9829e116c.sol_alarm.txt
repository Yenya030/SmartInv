Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The vestedAmount can be modified after deployment using direct access, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The release function lacks access control, allowing anyone to trigger the release of funds, which may not be intended.
3) Insufficient gas: If the transfer of funds in the release function requires excessive gas, it may fail and prevent the beneficiary from receiving the funds.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculations involving vestedAmount may be vulnerable to integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.
