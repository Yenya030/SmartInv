Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable in the 'endExecute' function is updated based on the balance of the contract without considering potential reentrancy attacks.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'startExecute', 'execute', and 'endExecute' functions are externally callable but do not have any access control mechanism, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract state.
