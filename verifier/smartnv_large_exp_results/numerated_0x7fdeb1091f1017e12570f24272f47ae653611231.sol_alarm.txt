The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: the assignment of lockedFunds in the endExecute function may not accurately reflect the intended state of the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the variables owner and votingToken are marked as internal, but they are not utilized within the contract. This could lead to confusion or unintended consequences.
