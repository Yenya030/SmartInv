The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `startingBlance`. This lack of visibility specification can lead to potential vulnerabilities.

2) Inconsistent State Update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking for potential reentrancy, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Integer Overflow/Underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve adding and subtracting amounts, which can potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities if not properly checked.

4) Insufficient Gas: The `endExecute` function checks for a condition that involves querying the balance of the contract, which may consume a considerable amount of gas and potentially lead to gas limit-related vulnerabilities.

5) Privilege Escalation: The `execute` function allows the execution of a proposal based solely on the current time and voted amount without proper authorization checks or validation, potentially leading to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
