This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `execute` function may not properly update the state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `votedProposal`, leading to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not restrict access appropriately to ensure proper ownership control.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas usage of the functions, there is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, leading to incomplete or failed transactions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
