Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks access control mechanisms, allowing anyone to call functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function increments proposal.votedAmount without checking for sufficient tokens in the address(this) balance, which could lead to inconsistent state.
3) Atomicity violation: The endExecute function checks for a condition and updates lockedFunds, which could lead to a race condition if multiple transactions try to call this function simultaneously.
4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, risking accidental Ether transfers to the contract address, resulting in potential Ether leakage.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of variables and functions, risking unintentional access or modification of critical data.
