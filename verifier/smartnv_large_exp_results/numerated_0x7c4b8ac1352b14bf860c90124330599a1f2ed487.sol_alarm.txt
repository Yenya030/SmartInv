The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The buyTokens function doesn't deduct the transferred tokens from the contract balance, leading to inconsistent state if the balance is not updated correctly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The withdrawTokens function should have restricted access modifiers to ensure only the admin can withdraw tokens, but currently, any address can call the function.
