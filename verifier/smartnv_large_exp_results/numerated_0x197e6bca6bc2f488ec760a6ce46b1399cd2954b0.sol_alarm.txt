This contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract can be exploited if the getPrice() function does not accurately reflect the market price, allowing for manipulation of the liquidation process.
2) Atomicity violation: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract transfers USDC and WETH tokens independently, which can lead to inconsistent states if one transfer fails while the other succeeds. 
3) Insufficient gas: If the liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract requires a large amount of gas due to multiple operations, it may run out of gas and fail to execute successfully.
