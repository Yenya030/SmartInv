Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function in the contract updates the votedAmount of the proposal without checking if the caller has the authority to do so, potentially leading to unauthorized state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to accessibility issues if not properly controlled.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves querying the balance of the contract which might consume excessive gas and lead to an out-of-gas error.
4) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total supply of the votingToken, this business logic might not be correctly implemented.
