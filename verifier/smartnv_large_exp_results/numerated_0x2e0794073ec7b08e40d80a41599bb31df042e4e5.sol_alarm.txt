The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
   - The function liquidate() in the contract ExchangeTokens could potentially encounter an integer underflow if the calculation (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) results in a value lower than dAmount, leading to unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The state variables WETH, USDC, pair, debt, and collateral in the ExchangeTokens contract are declared as public, which could expose sensitive information to unauthorized external entities and potentially compromise the security of the contract.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The liquidate() function in the ExchangeTokens contract involves transferring tokens from one address to another, which might result in running out of gas if there is a large number of users trying to liquidate their funds simultaneously, leading to the transaction failing unexpectedly.
