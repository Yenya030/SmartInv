Contract you are analyzing:
contract VotingSystem {
         struct Voter {
              uint256 weight;
              bool voted;
              address delegate;

         mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
         uint256 public winningProposal;

         bool public votingEnded;
         
         modifier onlyOwner() {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
             _;
         }
         
         function delegate(address to) public {

         }
         
         function endVoting() public onlyOwner {
             require(!votingEnded, "Voting has already ended");
             votingEnded = true;
         }
} 

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Business logic flaw
- Potential atomicity violation
