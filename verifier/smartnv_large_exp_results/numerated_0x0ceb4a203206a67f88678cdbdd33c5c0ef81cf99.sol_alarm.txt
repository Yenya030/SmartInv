The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the variable lockedFunds without any further checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled properly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contracts do not specify the visibility of their state variables, which could potentially lead to accessibility or ownership issues if not set appropriately.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
