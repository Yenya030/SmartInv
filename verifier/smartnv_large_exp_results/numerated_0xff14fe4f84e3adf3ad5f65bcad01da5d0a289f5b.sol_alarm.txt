The following contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList`, which may lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` statement in the `execute` function directly updates the `votedAmount` without proper validation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential vulnerabilities.

3) Atomicity violation: The `votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);` in the `execute` function transfers tokens without using proper atomicity checks, opening up the possibility of reentrancy attacks or other vulnerabilities.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculations involving `votedAmount` and `startingBalance` in the `execute` and `startExecute` functions might be susceptible to integer overflow or underflow if not properly handled.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not have proper mechanisms to handle ether transactions, which may result in ether leakage or unintended behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Atomicity violation
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Ether leakage
