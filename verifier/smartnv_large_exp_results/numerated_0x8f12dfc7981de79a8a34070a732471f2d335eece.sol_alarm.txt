Potential Vulnerabilities:
- Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas when executing transactions due to transferring Ether without considering the gas limit.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and state variables should be carefully reviewed to ensure that only the intended parties can access or modify them.
