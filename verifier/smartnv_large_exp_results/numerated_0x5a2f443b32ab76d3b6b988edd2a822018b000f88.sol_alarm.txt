The contract to analyze:
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public escrowAmount;
    bool public releasedToSeller;
    bool public releasedToBuyer;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _escrowAmount) public {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        escrowAmount = _escrowAmount;
        releasedToSeller = false;
        releasedToBuyer = false;
    }

    function releaseToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only seller or arbiter can release funds.");
        require(!releasedToSeller, "Funds have already been released to seller.");
        
        releasedToSeller = true;
        seller.transfer(escrowAmount);
    }

    function releaseToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only buyer or arbiter can release funds.");
        require(!releasedToBuyer, "Funds have already been released to buyer.");
        
        releasedToBuyer = true;
        buyer.transfer(escrowAmount);
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
