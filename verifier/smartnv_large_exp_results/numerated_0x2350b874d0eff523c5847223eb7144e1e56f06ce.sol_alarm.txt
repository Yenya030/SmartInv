Contract to be analyzed:

contract PaymentContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public payments;
    uint256 public totalPayments;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function makePayment(uint256 paymentAmount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can make payments");
        payments[totalPayments] = paymentAmount;
        totalPayments++;
    }

    function getPaymentTotal() public view returns (uint256) {
        return totalPayments;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        uint256 totalAmount = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalPayments; i++) {
            totalAmount += payments[i];
            payments[i] = 0;
        }
        payable(owner).transfer(totalAmount);
    }
}

Output:
- cross bridge inconsistency
