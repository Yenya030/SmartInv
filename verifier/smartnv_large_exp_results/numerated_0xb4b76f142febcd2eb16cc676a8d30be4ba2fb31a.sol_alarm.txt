The contract provided is:

contract Vesting {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public start;
    uint public cliff;
    uint public duration;
    uint public interval;
    uint public totalAmount;
    uint public released;
    
    constructor(
        IERC20 _token,
        address _beneficiary,
        uint _start,
        uint _cliff,
        uint _duration,
        uint _interval,
        uint _totalAmount
    ) {
        token = _token;
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        start = _start;
        cliff = _cliff;
        duration = _duration;
        interval = _interval;
        totalAmount = _totalAmount;
    }
    
    function release() public {
        require(block.timestamp >= start, "Vesting hasn't started yet");
        uint vested = (block.timestamp - start) / interval * totalAmount / duration;
        
        if (vested > released) {
            uint amount = vested - released;
            require(amount <= token.balanceOf(address(this)), "Not enough tokens to release");
            
            released += amount;
            token.transfer(beneficiary, amount);
        }
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

3) Business logic flaw: The calculation for vested tokens in the release function may not accurately distribute the tokens over time as intended due to potential integer division truncation issues.
10) Arithmetic flaw: The arithmetic operations in the release function, particularly the division operation for calculating vested tokens, could result in integer overflow/underflow.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The constructor function and state variables are not explicitly defined with access modifiers like public or internal, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionality to unauthorized access.

The vulnerabilities identified in the contract are business logic flaw, arithmetic flaw, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
