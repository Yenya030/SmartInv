The contract provided for analysis is:
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint vote;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    address public winningProposal;
    uint public winningVoteCount;
    
    function vote(uint proposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(sender.voted == false, "Already voted.");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = proposal;
        if (winningVoteCount < proposal) {
            winningVoteCount = proposal;
            winningProposal = msg.sender;
        }
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract VotingSystem are:
- Inconsistent state update: The winningProposal is updated with the address of the sender instead of the proposal number.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The voters mapping is public, allowing anyone to see the voter information, which may not be desirable depending on the use case.
