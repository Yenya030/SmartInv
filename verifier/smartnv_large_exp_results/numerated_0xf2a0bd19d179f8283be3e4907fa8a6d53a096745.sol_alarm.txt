The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal by increasing the voted amount but does not handle potential re-entrancy issues that could arise.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may fail if there is not enough gas to cover the execution of all internal calls.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
