contract FeeSplitter {
    address public owner;
    address public token;
    uint public totalFees;

    constructor(address _token) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
    }

    function splitFees(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "only the owner can split fees");
        totalFees += amount / 2;
        token.transfer(owner, amount / 2);
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Privilege escalation: The splitFees function can only be called by the owner, but there is no restriction on who can set the owner initially in the constructor.
2) Inconsistent state update: The totalFees variable is updated before transferring the amount to the owner, which can lead to inconsistencies if the transfer fails.
3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, which can be received accidentally and result in Ether being trapped in the contract.
