The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Insufficient gas: The functions within the contract might require more gas than allowed, leading to incomplete execution of the functions.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables within the contract might not be properly defined, leading to potential access control issues.
