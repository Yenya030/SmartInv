The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function sets the `lockedFunds` variable without any checks or safeguards, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if not appropriately handled.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially run out of gas if the loop to check `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` exceeds the gas limit, resulting in the function failing to execute completely.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable in the `TimelockController` contract is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to issues related to visibility and ownership control.
