The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is public, which might expose sensitive information about the contract owner. It is recommended to use private visibility for owner variable.
2) Insufficient gas - The transfer method used in the release and withdraw functions might run out of gas if the beneficiary is a contract with a complex fallback function. Consider using a withdrawal pattern to allow users to withdraw funds instead of transferring them directly.
