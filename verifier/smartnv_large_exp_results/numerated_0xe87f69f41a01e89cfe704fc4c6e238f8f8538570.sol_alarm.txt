The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute()` function without any check or validation, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and variables such as `owner`, `votingToken`, and `startingBalanceList` are marked as internal, making them accessible to external contracts and potentially compromising the contract's functionality.

Please review and address these potential vulnerabilities in the contract.
