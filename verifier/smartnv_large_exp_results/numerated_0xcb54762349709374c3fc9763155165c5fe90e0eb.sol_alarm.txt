Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` directly, which may lead to inconsistent state. It is recommended to use a separate variable to update the voted amount and then update the proposal.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` inherits from `IERC20`, which raises concerns about visibility and ownership of the functions and variables inherited from the interface. It is important to ensure that the visibility and ownership of inherited functions are correctly defined in the contract.

Overall, the contract does not exhibit major vulnerabilities.
