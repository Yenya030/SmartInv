Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The confirmSeller and confirmBuyer functions should have restricted access to only the designated seller and buyer respectively. Any user can currently call these functions.
- Inconsistent state update: There is no check to ensure that both parties have not confirmed before releasing funds, leading to the potential for one party to confirm while the other has not, allowing for the release of funds prematurely.
