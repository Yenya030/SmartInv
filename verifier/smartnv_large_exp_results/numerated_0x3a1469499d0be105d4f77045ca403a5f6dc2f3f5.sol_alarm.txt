The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the balance of the sender after transferring tokenA, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions in the contract are external, which may not be the intended visibility.
