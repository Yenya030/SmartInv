The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

```solidity
contract EscrowContract {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public price;
    bool public sellerApproved;
    bool public buyerApproved;
    
    constructor(address _seller, address _buyer, address _arbiter, uint _price) {
        seller = _seller;
        buyer = _buyer;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        price = _price;
    }
    
    function payToEscrow() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can pay to escrow.");
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect payment amount.");
    }
    
    function approveBySeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can approve.");
        sellerApproved = true;
    }
    
    function approveByBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can approve.");
        buyerApproved = true;
    }
    
    function releaseToSeller() public {
        require(sellerApproved, "Seller has not approved yet.");
        require(buyerApproved, "Buyer has not approved yet.");
        payable(seller).transfer(price);
    }
}
```

Based on the analysis of this contract, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:

7) ID uniqueness violation - There are no checks in place to ensure that duplicate IDs for the seller, buyer, or arbiter are not set, which could lead to confusion and potential errors in the contract's execution.

14) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The functions `approveBySeller`, `approveByBuyer`, and `releaseToSeller` do not restrict access based on ownership, allowing anyone to call these functions which could lead to unauthorized operations. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the EscrowContract are ID uniqueness violation and incorrect visibility/ownership.
