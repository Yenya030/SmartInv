The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update - The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal, leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Privilege escalation - The startExecute() function allows any address to start a new proposal, potentially escalating privileges.
3) Arithmetic flaw - In the function liquidate(), there is a potential arithmetic flaw when calculating the fund liquidation condition, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
