Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper checks and balances, potentially allowing for inconsistent state updates.
- Incorrect visibility: The `votedProposal` function is called without defining its visibility, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
- Insufficient gas: If the gas limit is not set properly, the contract may run out of gas during execution, causing the functions to fail midway.
