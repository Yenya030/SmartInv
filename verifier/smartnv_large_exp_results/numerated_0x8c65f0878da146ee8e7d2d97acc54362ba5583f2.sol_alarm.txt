Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Insufficient Gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution, especially in operations involving token transfers and calculations, leading to incomplete transactions or unexpected behavior. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined in the contract, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data. 

3) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state changes happening in different functions without proper synchronization or validation, potentially leading to inconsistent or unexpected contract states. 

4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no indication of handling unique identifiers for proposals or other entities, which may result in errors or conflicts when processing multiple instances. 

5) Arithmetic flaw: The contract includes arithmetic operations that may be prone to overflow/underflow issues, leading to inaccurate calculations or unexpected behavior. 

6) Ether leakage: There is a lack of proper handling of Ether transactions, which may result in Ether getting stuck in the contract or not being transferred correctly. 

7) Reentrancy: The contract does not implement proper checks or mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks, where a malicious contract can repeatedly call functions to exploit vulnerabilities.
