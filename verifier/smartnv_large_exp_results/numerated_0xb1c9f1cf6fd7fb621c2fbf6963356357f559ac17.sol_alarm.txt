The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented directly in the `execute` function without any check for overflow.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function transfers tokens from `proposal.addr` to the contract but does not ensure that all the necessary steps are completed atomically.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas limit is reached during the execution.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not declared as public, allowing potential visibility issues. Additionally, the `owner` variable is not used or enforced in the contract.

Overall, the contract may suffer from potential vulnerabilities related to state updates, atomicity, gas constraints, and visibility/ownership.
