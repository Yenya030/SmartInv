Contract to analyze:

contract CryptoBank {
         IERC20 public token;
         address public owner;

         constructor(address _token) {
             token = IERC20(_token);
             owner = msg.sender;
         }
         
         function deposit(uint amount) public {
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
         }
         
         function withdraw(uint amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
             token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `withdraw` function allows anyone to withdraw funds as long as they know the owner's address, which is not secure. The function should only allow the owner to withdraw funds.

2) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, which means it is not secure against accidental Ether transfers.

3) Insufficient gas: The `withdraw` function depends on the owner having enough gas to perform the transaction, which could lead to a denial-of-service attack if the owner runs out of gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
