The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;
    
    function swapTokens(uint amountA, uint amountB) public {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountA, "Insufficient balance for tokenA");
        require(tokenB.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountB, "Insufficient balance for tokenB");
        
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not include any state updates that could lead to this vulnerability.

Therefore, the potential vulnerability in the provided contract is "inconsistent state update."
