The contract provided for analysis is:

contract ExampleContract {
     address public owner;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     function deposit() public payable {
         balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow - The balances mapping might be susceptible to integer overflow or underflow if the amount deposited or withdrawn exceeds the maximum or minimum integer value.

2) Ether leakage - If there are issues with the withdraw function implementation, it could potentially lead to ether being stuck in the contract and not being properly transferred back to the sender.

3) Insufficient gas - If the contract has a large number of balances stored in the mapping, the gas required to iterate through all of them during withdrawal could exceed the block gas limit, leading to a failed transaction.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
