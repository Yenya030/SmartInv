Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated without any proper synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function but its visibility is not provided, which could lead to incorrect accessibility and ownership concerns.
