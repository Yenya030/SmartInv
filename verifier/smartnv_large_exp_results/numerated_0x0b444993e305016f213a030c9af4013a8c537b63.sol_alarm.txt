Contract to be analyzed:
```solidity
contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public payments;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function processPayment(address _recipient, uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can process payment");
        payments[_recipient] += _amount;
    }

    function withdrawPayment(address _recipient) public {
        uint paymentAmount = payments[_recipient];
        require(paymentAmount > 0, "No payment available for withdrawal");
        payments[_recipient] = 0;
        _recipient.transfer(paymentAmount);
    }
}
```

Output:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
