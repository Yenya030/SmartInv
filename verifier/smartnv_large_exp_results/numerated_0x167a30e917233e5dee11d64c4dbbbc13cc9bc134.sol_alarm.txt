Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update the state variables in the startExecute, execute, and endExecute functions, which could lead to inconsistent data being stored.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, which could potentially lead to incorrect access control.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a large amount of gas if the execution fails, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

5) Ether leakage: There is a lack of handling Ether in the contract, which could result in unintended behavior if Ether is sent to the contract.

6) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function includes a condition that checks if the balance of the contract is at least half of the total supply of the voting token, which may not accurately reflect the desired business logic.

7) Atomicity violation: The execution of multiple operations in the execute function without proper synchronization could lead to atomicity violations.

8) Arithmetic flaw: There is a potential arithmetic flaw in the startExecute function where the startingBalanceList is updated without being properly initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

9) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include any mechanisms to prevent or handle suicidal contract behavior, which could lead to loss of funds or disruption of the contract.

10) Privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce proper access control checks in various functions, potentially leading to privilege escalation vulnerabilities. 

11) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts or interfaces, such as IERC20 and IUniswapV2Pair, without ensuring consistent data flow or updates. 

Overall, the contract contains several potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure its security and functionality.
