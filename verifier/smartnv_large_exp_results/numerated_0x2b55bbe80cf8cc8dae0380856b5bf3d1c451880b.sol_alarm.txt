Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables in the contract are being updated in the functions, such as proposal struct's votedAmount being updated in the execute function. This can lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs or addresses in the contract. This could potentially lead to issues with data integrity and reliability.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables in the contract is not clearly specified. This could lead to unintended access or manipulation of the contract state by unauthorized parties.

4) Suicidal contracts: There are no mechanisms in place to prevent the contract from being destroyed by using the selfdestruct function. This could lead to loss of funds and disruption of the contract's functionality.
