The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has variables like `lockedFunds` and `startingBalanceList` that are being updated in different functions without clear consistency, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract lacks explicit visibility modifiers for functions and variables, making it unclear who has access to execute certain functions and manipulate certain variables. This can lead to unauthorized operations on the contract.
