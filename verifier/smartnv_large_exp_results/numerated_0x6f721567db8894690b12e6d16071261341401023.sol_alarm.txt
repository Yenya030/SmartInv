The following contract may have potential vulnerabilities: 

- Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state if other parts of the contract are not properly updating this variable.
- Insufficient gas: The use of gas-intensive operations such as transferring tokens in `execute()` could potentially lead to out of gas errors, especially if multiple calls are made in quick succession.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not provide the intended visibility or ownership control in the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
