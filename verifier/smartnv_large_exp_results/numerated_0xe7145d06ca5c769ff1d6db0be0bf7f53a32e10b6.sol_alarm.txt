The contract being analyzed:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount * tokenPrice, "Incorrect amount sent");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function setTokenPrice(uint price) public {
        tokenPrice = price;
    }
}

Output:  
1) privilege escalation
2) atomicity violation 
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
