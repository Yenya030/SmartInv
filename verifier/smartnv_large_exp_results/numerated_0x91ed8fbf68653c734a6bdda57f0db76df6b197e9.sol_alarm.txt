This contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update and Insufficient gas.
