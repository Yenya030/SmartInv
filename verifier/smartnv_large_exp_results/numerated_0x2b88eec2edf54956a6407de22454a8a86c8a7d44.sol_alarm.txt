The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the `proposal` struct in multiple functions without ensuring that the state is consistently updated, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for the variable. This could potentially lead to ownership-related vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

3) Insufficient gas: If the `execute` function requires a large gas amount for execution due to the transferFrom operations, it could result in insufficient gas for the function to complete successfully. This could lead to the function failing or getting stuck.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior if multiple proposals share the same ID.

5) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function's logic for determining the success of execution based on the balance of the contract may not accurately reflect the desired business logic, potentially leading to unintended outcomes.
