The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount directly without any checks, potentially allowing for inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20 but does not actually define all the required functions which may cause incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute calculates the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially hit the gas limit, preventing the successful execution of the function.

4) For example, the `_transfer` function may have arithmetic flaws if not implemented correctly, causing potential vulnerabilities.
