The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` in contract `TimelockController` updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables `WETH`, `USDC`, and `pair` in contract `ExchangeTokens` are public, which could expose sensitive information to external users.
