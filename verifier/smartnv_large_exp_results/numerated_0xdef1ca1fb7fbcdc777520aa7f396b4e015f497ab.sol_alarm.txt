Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integrity violation: There are multiple state update operations that are not atomic, such as updating the 'proposal.votedAmount' in the 'execute' function and 'lockedFunds' in the 'endExecute' function.
2) Insufficient input validation: There are no checks in place to ensure the input 'amount' in the 'execute' function is not negative.
3) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variable 'startingBalanceList' in the 'startExecute' function without further validation, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.
4) Incorrect access control: The 'owner' variable is defined but not utilized for any specific role-based access control mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized access to critical functions.
