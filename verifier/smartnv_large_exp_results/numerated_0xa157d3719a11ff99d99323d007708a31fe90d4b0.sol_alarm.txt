The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public voteCount;
    address public winner;

    function voteForCandidate(address candidate) public {
        voteCount[candidate]++;
    }

    function endVoting() public {
        uint maxVotes = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < voteCount.length; i++) {
            if (voteCount[i] > maxVotes) {
                maxVotes = voteCount[i];
                winner = address(i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract attempts to iterate over the `voteCount` mapping using `voteCount.length`, which is not valid since `voteCount` is a mapping and not an array.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `voteCount` mapping is set to public, exposing all vote counts to anyone, which might not be desired depending on the intended functionality.
3) Insufficient gas: If the `voteCount` mapping grows too large, the `endVoting` function may run out of gas during execution, causing the transaction to fail.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
