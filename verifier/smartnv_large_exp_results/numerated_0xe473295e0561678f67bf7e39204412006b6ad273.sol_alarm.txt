The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The 'lockedFunds' variable is being updated in the 'endExecute' function without any proper validation or checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the 'votedProposal' function, which can lead to issues with function accessibility and ownership control.
