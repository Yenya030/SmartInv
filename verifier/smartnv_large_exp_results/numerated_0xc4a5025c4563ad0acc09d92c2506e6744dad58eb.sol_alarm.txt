Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable proposal without checking if there is an existing proposal already ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not define any of the required functions specified in the interface, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total token supply, which may consume a significant amount of gas leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
4) Reentrancy: The function liquidate() in the ExchangeTokens contract performs transfers of tokens before updating the debt and collateral mappings, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
