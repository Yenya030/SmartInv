The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are declared as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility level. Additionally, the ownership of the contract is not explicitly defined, which may pose a security risk.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` statement updates the `votedAmount` without any checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The `startingBalanceList` mapping is updated based on the `proposal.addr`, which might not guarantee ID uniqueness and could lead to unexpected behavior.

4) Insufficient gas: The `votingToken.transferFrom()` function is called without ensuring sufficient gas for the transaction, which could result in the transaction failing due to running out of gas.

5) Atomicity violation: The contract lacks mechanisms to ensure atomicity in operations, which may lead to race conditions and undesired behavior.
