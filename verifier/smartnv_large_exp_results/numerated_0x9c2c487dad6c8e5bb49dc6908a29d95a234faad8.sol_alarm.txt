Potential vulnerabilities in the contract at the end:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is missing visibility specifiers for functions and state variables, making it susceptible to unintended access.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` state variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the number of voters in the system is too large, leading to the failure of the execution process.
4) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function may result in integer overflow/underflow if the values involved are very large, leading to incorrect results.
5) Business logic flaw: The `startExecute` function does not have proper checks for ensuring only the owner can initiate a new proposal, which can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
6) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
7) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, leaving it vulnerable to potential Ether leakage if not handled properly.
