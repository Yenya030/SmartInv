Contract to analyze: 

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        bool voted;
        uint vote;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint public totalVotes;
    
    function vote(uint option) public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = option;
        totalVotes++;
    }
    
    function getWinner() public view returns (uint winningOption) {
        require(totalVotes > 0, "No votes yet");
        
        uint[] memory voteCounts;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
            voteCounts[voters[address(i)].vote]++;
        }
        
        uint maxVotes = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < voteCounts.length; i++) {
            if (voteCounts[i] > maxVotes) {
                maxVotes = voteCounts[i];
                winningOption = i;
            }
        }
    }
}

Output:
1) business logic flaw: The contract has a potential logic flaw in the getWinner function where the array voteCounts is not initialized correctly, leading to potential issues with tracking the votes and determining the winner accurately.

2) inconsistent state update: The state of totalVotes is modified in the vote function but is not properly handled in terms of updating the totalVotes count accurately, which may lead to inconsistent state.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses addresses as identifiers for voters, which may not guarantee uniqueness and can potentially lead to conflicts or unauthorized access.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The voters mapping is declared as public, which exposes sensitive information about voters' voting status and choices publicly, violating privacy concerns.

Please check and correct these vulnerabilities in the contract.
