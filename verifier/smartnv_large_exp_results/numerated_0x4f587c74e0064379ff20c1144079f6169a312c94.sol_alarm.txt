The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership of the `proposal` variable in the TimelockController contract, as it should be marked as private to prevent external access.
2) Insufficient gas in the endExecute function of the TimelockController contract, as it may fail to execute if there is not enough gas provided.
3) ID uniqueness violation for the Proposal struct in the TimelockController contract, as there is no check to ensure unique IDs are assigned to each proposal.
4) Inconsistent state update in the startExecute function of the TimelockController contract, as the startingBlance variable is misspelled, which may lead to unintended behavior.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership of the `pair` variable in the ExchangeTokens contract, as it should be marked as private to prevent external access.
