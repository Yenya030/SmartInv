The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without any safeguards or checks, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if not properly handled.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced without being defined in the contract, which may indicate a visibility or ownership issue depending on the intended functionality.
