Contract:

contract MultiSigWallet {
    address private owner;
    uint private transactionCount;
    mapping(uint => Transaction) private transactions;

    struct Transaction {
        address sender;
        address recipient;
        uint amount;
        bool processed;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }

    function submitTransaction(address _recipient, uint _amount) external onlyOwner {
        Transaction memory newTransaction = Transaction(msg.sender, _recipient, _amount, false);
        transactions[transactionCount] = newTransaction;
        transactionCount++;
    }

    function processTransaction(uint _transactionId) external onlyOwner {
        require(transactions[_transactionId].processed == false, "Transaction already processed");
        require(address(this).balance >= transactions[_transactionId].amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
        transactions[_transactionId].processed = true;
        payable(transactions[_transactionId].recipient).transfer(transactions[_transactionId].amount);
    }

    function getTransactionCount() external view returns (uint) {
        return transactionCount;
    }
}

Output:
- Inconsistent state update: The processed flag of a transaction can be manipulated without proper validation, leading to incorrect transaction status.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle situations where gas might be insufficient for executing transactions, potentially leaving transactions stranded without completion.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: Some functions could benefit from being declared as private to prevent unintended external access and ensure proper encapsulation.
