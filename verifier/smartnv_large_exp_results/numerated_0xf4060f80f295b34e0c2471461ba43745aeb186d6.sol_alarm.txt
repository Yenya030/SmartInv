Contract analysis:
The contract provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, but it does not consider any potential changes in the balance during the execution of the function. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks the balance of the contract and compares it to the total supply of the voting token. This operation may consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors if the contract holds a large balance.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal IDs, which could result in issues if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide implementations for the required functions. This could lead to issues with the contract's visibility and ownership.

5) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include any safeguards to prevent self-destruct or transfer of the contract's balance, which could result in loss of funds if malicious actions are taken.

6) Arithmetic flaw: The function liquidate() uses integer arithmetic to calculate the liquidation price, which may introduce precision errors or unintended behavior due to rounding.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update
2) Insufficient gas
3) ID uniqueness violation
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership
5) Suicidal contracts
6) Arithmetic flaw
