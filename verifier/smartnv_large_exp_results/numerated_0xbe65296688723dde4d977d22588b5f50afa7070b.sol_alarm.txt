The contract in question contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `proposal`, `owner`, `votingToken`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` are not specified with any visibility modifier, making them publicly accessible and potentially modifiable by external contracts or users.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated directly in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper checks or validations, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute due to insufficient gas if the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of its operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

4) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function may not accurately reflect the intended business logic and could lead to unexpected outcomes.

5) Ether leakage: The contract interacts with tokens through `transferFrom` functions without properly handling potential reentrancy attacks, which could result in unintended ether leakage.

6) Privilege escalation: The contract does not include proper access control mechanisms to restrict sensitive functions like `execute` and `endExecute` to authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized privilege escalation.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, business logic flaw, ether leakage, and privilege escalation.
