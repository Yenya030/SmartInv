The contract provided for analysis:

contract Lottery {
    address public owner;
    uint public prizePool;

    mapping(address => uint) public participants;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        prizePool = 0;
    }

    function enterLottery(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(prizePool + amount >= prizePool, "Integer overflow");
        
        participants[msg.sender] += amount;
        prizePool += amount;
    }

    function pickWinner() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can pick winner");
        
        uint winnerIndex = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty, participants))) % prizePool;
        address winner = address(winnerIndex);
        
        uint winnings = prizePool;
        prizePool = 0;
        
        (bool success,) = winner.call{value: winnings}("");
        require(success, "Failed to send winnings to winner");
    }
}

Output:
1) integer overflow/underflow
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
