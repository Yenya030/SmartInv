The contract being analyzed:

contract VotingSystem {
         uint public totalVotes;
         mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

         function vote() public {
             require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
             totalVotes++;
             hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure uniqueness of voter addresses, which could lead to multiple votes from the same address.
2) Inconsistent state update: The totalVotes count and hasVoted mapping are updated independently, which could lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The hasVoted mapping is public, potentially exposing the voting status of addresses to external entities.
