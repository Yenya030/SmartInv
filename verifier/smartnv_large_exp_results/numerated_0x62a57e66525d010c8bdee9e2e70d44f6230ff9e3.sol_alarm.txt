The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSale {
         address public owner;
         IERC20 public token;

         constructor(address _token) {
             owner = msg.sender;
             token = IERC20(_token);
         }

         function buyTokens(uint amount) external {
             require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "insufficient tokens");
             token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         }

         function changeOwnership(address newOwner) external {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can change ownership");
             owner = newOwner;
         }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
2) privilege escalation
