Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" variable based on the condition "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()". This update may not accurately reflect the intended state of the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility/ownership of certain variables and functions, such as "lockedFunds" and "votedProposal". This lack of clarity can lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.
3) Business logic flaw: The condition "getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount" in the "liquidate" function may not accurately determine if a user's fund can be liquidated, potentially leading to incorrect actions being taken.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential issues related to gas costs, such as gas exhaustion during function execution, which can result in failed transactions or unexpected behavior.
