The contract provided for analysis:

contract InsuredExchange {
         IERC20 public ETH;
         IERC20 public DAI;
         mapping(address => uint) public ethBalances;
         mapping(address => uint) public daiBalances;
         
         function exchangeETHtoDAI(uint amount) public {
             require(ethBalances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient ETH balance");
             ethBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
             daiBalances[msg.sender] += amount * 2;
         }
         
         function exchangeDAItoETH(uint amount) public {
             require(daiBalances[msg.sender] >= amount * 2, "Insufficient DAI balance");
             daiBalances[msg.sender] -= amount * 2;
             ethBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
         }
     }

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The ethBalances and daiBalances mappings are directly updated without proper checks or validation that could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the function exchangeETHtoDAI and exchangeDAItoETH may lead to arithmetic flaws if not handled carefully.
3) Insufficient gas: The functions exchangeETHtoDAI and exchangeDAItoETH do not specify gas requirements, which could potentially lead to insufficient gas issues during the execution of these functions.
