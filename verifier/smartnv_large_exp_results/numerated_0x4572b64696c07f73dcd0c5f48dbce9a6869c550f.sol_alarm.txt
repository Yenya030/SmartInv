The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which may not restrict access properly.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without considering all possible scenarios that may lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas in the `execute` function since there is no gas stipend provided for the external function call to `votedProposal`.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation of `startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr)` in the `startExecute` function.

5) Business logic flaw: The conditions in the `endExecute` function may not accurately determine the success of the execution, leading to potential business logic flaws.

6) ID uniqueness violation: There is a risk of ID duplication for proposals since there is no mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal identifiers.

7) Reentrancy: The contract allows external calls to transfer tokens before updating state variables, which may expose it to reentrancy attacks.


Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Business logic flaw
- ID uniqueness violation
- Reentrancy
