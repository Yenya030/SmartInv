Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount in the Proposal struct, but there is no synchronization mechanism to ensure atomicity of this update, which could lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but it does not define any of the required functions from the interface, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership of functions. 

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function performs a check that requires a calculation involving the balance of the contract and the total supply of tokens. If the gas limit is reached during this calculation, it could result in the function failing to execute properly.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
