The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` has a conditional check for `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which can lead to an inconsistent state if the condition is not properly handled.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility modifiers for the variables `lockedFunds`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, `owner`, and `votingToken`, which can lead to incorrect access control and ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract may require a significant amount of gas for execution, which can lead to insufficient gas issues if users do not provide enough gas.

4) Possible ether leakage: If the contract manipulates ether directly or if other contracts call functions that involve ether transfers, there may be a risk of ether leakage.

5) Possible integer overflow/underflow: Depending on the implementation of functions and calculations involving integers, there may be a risk of integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.
