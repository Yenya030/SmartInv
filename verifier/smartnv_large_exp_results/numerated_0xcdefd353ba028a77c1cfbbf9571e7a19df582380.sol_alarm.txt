Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in ExchangeTokens contract directly updates the debt and collateral mappings without proper validation or authorization checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function in ExchangeTokens contract calculates the price based on the balance of USDC and WETH tokens in the pair contract, which could potentially be manipulated to influence the price calculation.
3) Insufficient gas: The liquidate function in ExchangeTokens contract involves transferring tokens from one address to another, which could potentially result in insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.
