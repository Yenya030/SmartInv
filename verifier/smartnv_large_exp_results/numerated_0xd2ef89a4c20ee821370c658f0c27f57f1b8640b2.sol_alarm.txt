Contract to analyze:

contract MultiSigWallet {
     address[] public owners;
     uint public transactionCount;
     mapping(uint => Transaction) public transactions;

     struct Transaction {
         address destination;
         uint value;
         bytes data;
         bool executed;
     }

     function submitTransaction(address destination, uint value, bytes memory data) public {
         uint transactionId = transactionCount; 
         transactions[transactionId] = Transaction({
             destination: destination,
             value: value,
             data: data,
             executed: false
         });
         transactionCount++;
     }

     function executeTransaction(uint transactionId) public {
         Transaction storage transaction = transactions[transactionId];
         require(!transaction.executed, "Transaction already executed");
         (bool success, ) = transaction.destination.call{value: transaction.value}(transaction.data);
         require(success, "Transaction execution failed");
         transaction.executed = true;
     }
}

Output:
1) potential vulnerabilities: 
- inconsistent state update
- reentrancy
