Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the interface IERC20, which doesn't make sense as TimelockController should be a separate contract.
- Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the proposal state but does not check if there is an existing proposal already in progress, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: If the execution of the endExecute function requires a large amount of gas, there could be a risk of running out of gas and the execution failing.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables lockedFunds and proposal are missing visibility specifier, which might lead to unintended access.
