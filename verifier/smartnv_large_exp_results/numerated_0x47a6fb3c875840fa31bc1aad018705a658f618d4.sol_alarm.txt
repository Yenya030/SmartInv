Contract to be analyzed:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    address public token;
    uint public price;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function changePrice(uint newPrice) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change price");
        price = newPrice;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The owner can change the price, potentially causing inconsistencies in the pricing system.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The changePrice function does not have the correct visibility and ownership check, allowing anyone to change the price.
3) Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function does not handle gas issues, potentially leading to transactions failing due to insufficient gas.
