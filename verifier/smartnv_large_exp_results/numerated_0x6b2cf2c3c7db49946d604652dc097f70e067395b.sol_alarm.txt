Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- privilege escalation (via owner variable and startExecute function)
- atomicity violation (modification of proposal state in multiple functions without proper synchronization)
- inconsistent state update (e.g., updating votedAmount without proper validation)
- incorrect visibility/ownership (owner variable is internal, which may lead to unexpected behavior)
