Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: It is possible that the calculation in the calculatePrice function could result in an integer overflow or underflow, especially if the values involved are large.
2) Price manipulation: The liquidate function relies on a getPrice function to determine whether a user's funds can be liquidated. If the getPrice function can be manipulated or influenced in any way, it could lead to price manipulation vulnerabilities.
