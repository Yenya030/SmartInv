Contract to be analyzed: 

contract DepositContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public deposits;
    address public owner;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(deposits[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        deposits[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the DepositContract:
1) Reentrancy vulnerability in the withdraw function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability as the owner variable is public.
3) Integer underflow vulnerability in the withdraw function.
