Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute does not update the state of proposal in the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is internal, which may expose the contract to ownership manipulation vulnerabilities.
