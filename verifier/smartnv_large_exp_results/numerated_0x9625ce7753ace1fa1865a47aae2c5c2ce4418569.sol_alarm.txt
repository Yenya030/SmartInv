The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does multiple state changes without using any mechanism to ensure that all state changes occur atomically.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `lockedFunds` variables are not declared with any visibility specifier, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
