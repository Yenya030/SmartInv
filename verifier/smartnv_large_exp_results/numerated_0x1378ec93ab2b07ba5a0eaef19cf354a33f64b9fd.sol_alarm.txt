Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not properly check for permission levels when executing functions, potentially allowing unauthorized individuals to execute functions they should not have access to.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential inconsistency in updating the proposal struct in the function execute. The proposal struct's votedAmount is incremented outside of the votedProposal function, which may lead to unexpected state changes.

3) Arithmetic flaw: In the function endExecute, the comparison (votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()) could potentially lead to arithmetic overflow if the values are very large, resulting in undesired behavior.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is not explicitly defined, which can cause issues related to data visibility and access control within the contract.
