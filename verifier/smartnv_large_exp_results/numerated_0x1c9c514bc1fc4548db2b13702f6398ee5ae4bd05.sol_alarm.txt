The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
- Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state.
- Insufficient gas: The endExecute function relies on checking the token balance and total supply, which could potentially run out of gas if the token balance or total supply is too large.
- Atomicity violation: The execute function transfers tokens and updates the votedAmount variable in multiple steps, which could lead to inconsistencies if the transaction fails midway.
