The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of `votingToken`, but the balance check is done after the state update. This can lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes after the update but before the check.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined as public or internal, which can lead to potential visibility issues. Additionally, the ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, which can lead to ownership control vulnerabilities.
