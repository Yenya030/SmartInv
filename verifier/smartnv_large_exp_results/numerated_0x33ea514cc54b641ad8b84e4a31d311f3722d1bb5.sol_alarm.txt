There are potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` state is being updated in multiple functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) which could lead to inconsistent state if not managed correctly.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is mentioned but not defined, which could potentially lead to ID uniqueness violation if multiple proposals use the same ID.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `owner` variable is not specified, which could lead to unintended access and ownership control issues.
4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limits, the execution of certain functions such as `endExecute` that involve multiple transactions could run out of gas, causing failures.
5) Ether leakage: There doesn't seem to be proper handling of Ether transactions, which could lead to potential Ether leakage vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) ID uniqueness violation
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
4) Insufficient gas
5) Ether leakage
