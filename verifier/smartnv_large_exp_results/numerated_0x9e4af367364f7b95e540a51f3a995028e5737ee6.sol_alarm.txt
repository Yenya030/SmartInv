Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

5) Atomicity violation: There are functions in the contract that perform multiple state-changing operations without using proper atomicity mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state changes if these operations are not completed together.

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for identifiers such as proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or inaccurate data handling.

13) Insufficient gas: The contract may require more gas than provided by the user, leading to transaction failures or incomplete execution of functions.

14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables in the contract may not be properly defined, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical contract features.
