The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is being updated in the "endExecute()" function without proper synchronization or validation, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute()" function may run out of gas due to the cost of the "require" statement for checking the condition "execution failed," potentially causing the function to be unable to complete successfully.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the variables "owner" and "votingToken," potentially leading to issues related to contract ownership or visibility.
