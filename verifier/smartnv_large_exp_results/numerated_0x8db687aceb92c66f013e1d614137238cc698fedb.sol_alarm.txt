The contract provided in the query is:

```
contract VotingContract {
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public userVotes;

    function vote() public {
        totalVotes += 1;
        userVotes[msg.sender] += 1;
    }

    function revokeVote() public {
        require(userVotes[msg.sender] > 0, "No vote to revoke");
        totalVotes -= 1;
        userVotes[msg.sender] -= 1;
    }
}
```

After analyzing the contract, the potential vulnerability identified is:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `totalVotes` and `userVotes` are made public, which means anyone can access and modify them directly. It's good practice to use private visibility for sensitive variables to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerability in the contract is incorrect visibility/ownership.
