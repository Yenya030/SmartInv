The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: the `proposal.votedAmount` in the `execute` function is updated directly without proper synchronization between different function calls or with external actors.
2) ID uniqueness violation: the `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function could potentially lead to ID uniqueness violation if there are multiple instances of the contract interacting with the same `lockedFunds` variable.
3) Atomicity violation: the `execute` function contains multiple state-changing operations that are not wrapped in a single transaction, which could lead to inconsistent state if one operation fails and the other succeeds.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the visibility of the `owner` variable is internal, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access if not properly defined.
