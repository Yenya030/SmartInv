The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the `proposal` struct in the `execute` function, which may lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `IERC20` interface is implemented in the contract, which may expose internal functions and variables to external entities. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical contract data.
