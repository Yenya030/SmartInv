The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function 'endExecute' updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without properly managing the state of other variables or ensuring the consistency of the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract lacks appropriate access control mechanisms such as modifiers or checks to restrict access to certain functions. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of critical contract functions.

3) Insufficient gas: The functions in the contract perform multiple state changes and operations, which may require significant gas to execute. Insufficient gas allocation could lead to transaction failures or incomplete execution of functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
