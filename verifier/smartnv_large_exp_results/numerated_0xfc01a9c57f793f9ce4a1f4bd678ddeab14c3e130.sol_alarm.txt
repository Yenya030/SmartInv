The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) In <\example_1\>:
   - Integer Overflow/Underflow: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` does not have a check for potential overflow when `execute` function is called multiple times with large amounts.

2) In <\example_2\>:
   - Price Manipulation: The `liquidate` function does not have proper validation for the price calculation, allowing potential price manipulation.
   - Arithmetic Flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function may result in unexpected behavior due to the order of operations.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are integer overflow/underflow, price manipulation, and arithmetic flaw.
