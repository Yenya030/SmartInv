Contract being analyzed:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public price;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        require(token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= amount, "Allowance not set");
        
        uint cost = amount * price;
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= cost, "Not enough tokens in contract");
        
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        token.transfer(msg.sender, cost);
    }
}

Output:
The potential vulnerability in the TokenSale contract is:
- Arithmetic flaw: The multiplication in the calculation of cost (amount * price) could potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow if the values of amount and price are not constrained appropriately.
