The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update state variables in the functions `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute`, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function uses a potentially large gas amount if the `require` condition fails, which could lead to out-of-gas exceptions and function failure.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the variables and functions, which could lead to unintended access or visibility issues.
