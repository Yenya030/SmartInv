This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the code snippet but is not defined in the contract. This could lead to an issue if the function is meant to have restricted visibility or ownership.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, possibly leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function calculates `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2` without considering gas limits, which could potentially result in insufficient gas for the transaction.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
