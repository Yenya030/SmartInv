The contract we need to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint _amount) public {
        require(votes[msg.sender] + _amount >= votes[msg.sender], "Integer overflow");
        votes[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }
    
    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change owner");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the `VotingSystem` contract are:

1) `integer overflow/underflow` vulnerability in the `vote` function due to unchecked addition.
2) `privilege escalation` vulnerability in the `changeOwner` function as any account can potentially call this function and change the owner.
3) `incorrect visibility` vulnerability where the `votes` mapping is publicly accessible, potentially exposing sensitive information.
