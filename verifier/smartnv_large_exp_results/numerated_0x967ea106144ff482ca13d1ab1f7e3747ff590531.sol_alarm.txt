The contract in question may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: In the startExecute function, the proposal struct is updated without properly initializing it, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not fully implement its functions, which could lead to incorrect behavior if those functions are called externally.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a significant amount of gas due to the check for execution failure, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
