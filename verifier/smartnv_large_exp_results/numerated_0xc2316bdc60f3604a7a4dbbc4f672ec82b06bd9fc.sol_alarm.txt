Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without ensuring proper synchronization of the state.

2) Atomicity violation: The function execute() has multiple state-changing operations that are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, which may lead to partial execution.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() uses a loop to check the balance of the contract against the total supply, which may consume excessive gas and potentially run out of gas.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may expose vulnerabilities related to access control and ownership.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle or manage Ether transactions, which may lead to Ether leakage vulnerabilities.
