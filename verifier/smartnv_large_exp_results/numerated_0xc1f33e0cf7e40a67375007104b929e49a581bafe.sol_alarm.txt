Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedProposal` function is called without being defined in the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated without specifying any visibility keyword (public, internal, private), which could lead to potential visibility or ownership issues.
