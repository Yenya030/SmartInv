This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` variables are not specified with any visibility keyword, making them effectively public. It is important to properly define the visibility of variables within a contract to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the `startingBlance` variable is declared but not used. This can lead to confusion and potential inconsistencies in the contract state.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state-changing operations without the use of any locking mechanism, potentially leading to race conditions and unintended behavior.

4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, the operations within the `endExecute` function may run out of gas, preventing the completion of the function and leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving addition and subtraction of amounts without proper checks for integer overflow/underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not implement any mechanisms to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, potentially leading to conflicts or inconsistencies in the proposal data.
