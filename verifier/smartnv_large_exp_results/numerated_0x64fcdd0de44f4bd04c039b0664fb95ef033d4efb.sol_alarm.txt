POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES IN THE CONTRACT:
1) Inconsistent state update - The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal directly, which may lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is declared as internal, which might lead to incorrect visibility or ownership control.
3) Insufficient gas - If the execution of the endExecute function requires too much gas, it may fail due to insufficient gas limit.
4) Business logic flaw - The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is twice the total supply of the voting token, which may not be a valid condition for a successful execution of the proposal.
5) ID uniqueness violation - There is no apparent mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to ID collision vulnerabilities.
6) Atomicity violation - The operations within the execute function are not atomic, which could result in inconsistent state if an error occurs midway through execution.
