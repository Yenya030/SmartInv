Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The setTokenPrice function could be susceptible to privilege escalation if the modifier for checking ownership is not properly implemented, allowing unauthorized users to change the token price.
- Price manipulation: If the tokenPrice is not properly validated or constrained, it could lead to potential price manipulation vulnerabilities.
- Insufficient gas: If the contract does not handle gas properly, there could be vulnerabilities related to running out of gas during contract execution.
- Integer overflow/underflow: The calculations involving amount * tokenPrice could potentially lead to integer overflow vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.
