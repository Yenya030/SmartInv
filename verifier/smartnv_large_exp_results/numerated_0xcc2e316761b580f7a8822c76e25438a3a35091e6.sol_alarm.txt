The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not define visibility for the `votingToken` variable, leaving it open to potential unauthorized access.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, the `proposal` variable is updated without checking if there are any ongoing proposals, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
3) Atomicity violation: In the `execute` function, multiple state changes occur without being wrapped in a single atomic transaction, which could result in inconsistent state if one change fails.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs multiple state operations, including checking balances and updating `lockedFunds`, which could potentially require lots of gas and lead to out-of-gas errors.
5) ID uniqueness violation: The code snippet does not handle ID uniqueness violations for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or confusion when dealing with multiple proposals.
