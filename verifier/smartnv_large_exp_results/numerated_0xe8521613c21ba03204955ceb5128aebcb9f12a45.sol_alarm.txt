The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without properly handling concurrency issues, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Reentrancy: The function liquidate() doesn't have proper checks to prevent reentrancy attacks, which can be exploited by malicious users to manipulate the contract's behavior.
3) Arithmetic flaw: The expression getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 in the liquidate() function may result in arithmetic overflow if the values are not properly constrained, leading to unexpected behavior.
4) Business logic flaw: The liquidate() function's condition for liquidating a user's fund may not accurately reflect the intended business logic, potentially allowing users to manipulate their funds improperly.
