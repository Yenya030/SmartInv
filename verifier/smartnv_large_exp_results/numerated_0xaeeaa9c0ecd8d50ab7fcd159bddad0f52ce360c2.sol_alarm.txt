The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without first checking if the proposal has ended successfully, which could lead to incorrect state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for this variable.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a large amount of gas due to the potential loop through all token holders, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
