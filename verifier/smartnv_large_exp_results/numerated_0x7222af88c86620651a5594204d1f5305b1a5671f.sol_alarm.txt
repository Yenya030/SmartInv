Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the proposal's votedAmount without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal variables owner and votingToken are not specified with any visibility, which can lead to potential ownership vulnerabilities or accessibility from external contracts.
