Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The release function should be restricted to only the owner to ensure that unauthorized users cannot release funds.
- Insufficient gas: The transfer function within the release function may fail if the gas provided is not enough for all transfers to complete successfully, leaving some payees without their shares.
