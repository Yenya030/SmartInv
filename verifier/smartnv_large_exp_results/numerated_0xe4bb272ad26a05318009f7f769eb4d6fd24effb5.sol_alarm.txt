Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable proposal without ensuring that it is in a consistent state, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() could potentially fail due to insufficient gas as it performs multiple operations in a single transaction, including checking for a condition and transferring tokens.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20, but it is unclear if the necessary functions are properly implemented and visible to external callers. This could lead to ownership or visibility issues.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could result in conflicts or data corruption.

5) Reentrancy: The contract may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks in the execute() function where external calls to the votingToken contract are made before updating the state variables, allowing potential reentrancy attacks.

6) Integer overflow/underflow: There are potential risks of integer overflow or underflow in calculations involving balance transfers or arithmetic operations within the contract.

7) Business logic flaw: There may be logical flaws in the implementation of the startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() functions that could lead to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities in the contract's behavior.

8) Atomicity violation: Multiple operations are performed in the endExecute() function without applying proper atomicity guarantees, which could lead to inconsistent or unpredictable state changes.
