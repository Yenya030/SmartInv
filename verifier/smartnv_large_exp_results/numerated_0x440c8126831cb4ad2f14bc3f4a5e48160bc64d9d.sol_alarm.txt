In the provided contract, there are potential vulnerabilities:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
In the function calculatePrice(), the division operation may result in an integer overflow/underflow if the result exceeds the maximum/minimum value that can be stored in a uint type.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
The visibility of the debt and collateral mappings is public, which can expose sensitive data to all external parties. Consider using more restricted visibility such as internal or private.

Overall, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow and incorrect visibility/ownership.
