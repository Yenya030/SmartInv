Vulnerabilities: 
1) privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any user to start a proposal, potentially overriding the existing proposal set by the owner. There is no check to ensure only the owner can start a proposal.

Vulnerabilities: 
2) price manipulation: The `liquidate` function can be vulnerable to price manipulation as it uses the `getPrice()` function result for determining whether a user's fund can be liquidated. This could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate prices and avoid liquidation.
