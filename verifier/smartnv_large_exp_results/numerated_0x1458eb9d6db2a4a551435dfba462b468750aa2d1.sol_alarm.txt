The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) atomicity violation: The `execute` function in the `TimelockController` contract does not ensure atomicity when updating the `votedAmount` of the proposal. 
2) inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function in the `TimelockController` contract updates the `lockedFunds` without ensuring consistency with the `votingToken` balance.
3) arithmetic flaw: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract may have an arithmetic flaw in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` which could lead to unexpected behavior.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract is public, which may expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
