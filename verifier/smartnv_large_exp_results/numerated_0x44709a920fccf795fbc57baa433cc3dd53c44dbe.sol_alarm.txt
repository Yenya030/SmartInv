Based on the contract provided, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not explicitly defined, leaving room for potential visibility misuse.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas checks in the functions, which could lead to potential out-of-gas errors during execution. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Insufficient gas.
