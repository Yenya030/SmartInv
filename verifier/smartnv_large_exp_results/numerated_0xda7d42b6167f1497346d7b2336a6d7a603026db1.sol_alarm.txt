The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute" updates the state variables "proposal" and "startingBalanceList" in different steps, which could lead to inconsistency in the state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide the necessary functions required by the interface. This could lead to issues related to incorrect function visibility or ownership.
3) Insufficient gas: The function "endExecute" might run out of gas if the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` consumes a lot of gas, preventing the function from executing successfully.
4) Suicidal contracts: There is no protective function to prevent the contract from self-destructing, which malicious actors could exploit.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle sending or receiving ether properly, which could lead to ether leakage issues.
