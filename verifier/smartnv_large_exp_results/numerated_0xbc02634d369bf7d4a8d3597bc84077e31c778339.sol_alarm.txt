Contract Analysis:

The contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not enforce access control, allowing anyone to call functions that should be restricted to certain roles or addresses.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function, but it is not being properly reset or finalized, leading to a potential inconsistency in the contract state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables and functions, potentially leading to unintended access or modifications.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract has functions that perform multiple operations in a single transaction, which may consume a large amount of gas and lead to out-of-gas errors.
5) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how this variable is being used or reset, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.

Output: 
1) Privilege escalation
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
4) Insufficient gas
5) Inconsistent state update
