1) inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` in the `execute` function could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions are updating the `votedAmount` at the same time.
2) atomicity violation: The `execute` function lacks proper atomicity measures which can potentially lead to undesired outcomes if multiple transactions are executed concurrently.

2) price manipulation: The comparison `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount` in the `liquidate` function could be manipulated if the price or amounts are not correctly calculated or controlled, leading to potential exploitation.

Overall, this contract has vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update and atomicity violation.
