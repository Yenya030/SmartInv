Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) integer overflow/underflow:
- In the function `endExecute()`, there is a potential for integer overflow when calculating `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2`, as it might exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint256 variable.

2) inconsistent state update:
- The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without resetting the `proposal` struct or performing any cleanup, which may lead to inconsistent state if multiple executions occur without proper reset.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but does not provide any implementation for the required functions such as `transfer` or `balanceOf`, which may lead to incorrect behavior or lack of functionality.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
