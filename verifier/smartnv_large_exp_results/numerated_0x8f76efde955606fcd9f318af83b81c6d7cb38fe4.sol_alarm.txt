Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts and potential issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is incrementally updated without using safe arithmetic operations, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the size of the operations and data manipulation, there might be a risk of running out of gas during execution, especially if the contract needs to perform multiple transactions in a single function call.
