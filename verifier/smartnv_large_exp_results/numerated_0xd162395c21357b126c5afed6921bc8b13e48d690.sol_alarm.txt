The contract provided is:

contract LoanContract {
    uint public loanAmount;
    uint public interestRate;
    address public borrower;
    address public lender;

    function borrow(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == borrower, "Only borrower can borrow");
        loanAmount = amount;
    }

    function repay(uint amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == borrower, "Only borrower can repay");
        lender.transfer(amount);
        loanAmount -= amount;
    }

    function setInterestRate(uint rate) external {
        require(msg.sender == lender, "Only lender can set interest rate");
        interestRate = rate;
    }
}

Based on the analysis, the potential vulnerabilities in the loan contract are:
