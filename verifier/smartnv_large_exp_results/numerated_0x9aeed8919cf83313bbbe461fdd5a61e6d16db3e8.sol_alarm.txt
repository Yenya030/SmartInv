The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Ether leakage
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
