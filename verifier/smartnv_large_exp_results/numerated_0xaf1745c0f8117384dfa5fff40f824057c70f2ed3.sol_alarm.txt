Contract being analyzed:
contract TokenSale {
    address public token;
    address public owner;
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public price;
    uint public totalTokens;
    uint public tokensSold;

    constructor(address _token, address _beneficiary, uint _price, uint _totalTokens) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        price = _price;
        totalTokens = _totalTokens;
        tokensSold = 0;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender != owner, "Owner cannot buy tokens");
        require(tokensSold + _amount <= totalTokens, "Not enough tokens left for sale");
        
        uint totalPrice = price * _amount;
        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, beneficiary, totalPrice);
        
        tokensSold += _amount;
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner of the TokenSale contract should not be able to buy tokens. This can lead to unauthorized actions and manipulation by the owner.
2) Inconsistent state update: The check for remaining tokens in the buyTokens function is not atomic, which can lead to race conditions and inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to buy tokens simultaneously.
