The contract provided for analysis:

contract PaymentContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the deposit function when adding the incoming value to the existing balance in the balances mapping.
2) Insufficient gas: The withdraw function may run out of gas if the balances mapping grows too large, causing the transaction to fail.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, potentially exposing the owner's address to unintended parties.
