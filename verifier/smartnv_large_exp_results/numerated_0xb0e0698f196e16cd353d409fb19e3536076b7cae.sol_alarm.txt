Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates `lockedFunds` without checking if the proposal execution was successful or not, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which might lead to unintended access control vulnerabilities.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include gas stipend for external calls, which could result in transactions failing due to out-of-gas errors.
