Contract being analyzed:

contract VotingSystem {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted; 
    uint public totalVotes;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalVotes = 0;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function updateOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function getVotes() public view returns (uint) {
        return totalVotes;
    }
}

Output:
- privilege escalation
- incorrect visibility/ownership
