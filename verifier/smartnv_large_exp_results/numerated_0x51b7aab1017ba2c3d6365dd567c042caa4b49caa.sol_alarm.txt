The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute might update the state of the contract inconsistently, as the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` does not check if the state update is valid.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the functions from the interface are not implemented correctly.
