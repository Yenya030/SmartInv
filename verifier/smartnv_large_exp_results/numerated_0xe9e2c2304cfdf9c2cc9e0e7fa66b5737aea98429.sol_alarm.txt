The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "proposal" is being updated in different functions without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of the variables and functions in the contract are not clearly defined, which may lead to issues related to data privacy and contract ownership.
