The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    
    function vote() external {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        
        // Perform voting logic
        
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
