The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not define the required functions such as transfer, balanceOf, allowance, etc. This can lead to issues with contract interoperability.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function increments the votedAmount in the proposal struct without updating the stored proposal state. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks if the locked funds are greater than half of the total supply, but it does not specify what action should be taken if this condition is not met. This can potentially lead to an incomplete execution of the endExecute function.
4) Potential reentrancy: The execute function transfers tokens from the proposal.addr without updating the votedAmount before calling votedProposal(proposal). This can potentially lead to reentrancy attacks.
5) Potential business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the execution has ended based on the timestamp, but it does not consider the possibility of timestamps being manipulated or attacked. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.
