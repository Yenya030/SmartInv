The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, potentially exposing it to external manipulation.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without ensuring atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent state changes.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
