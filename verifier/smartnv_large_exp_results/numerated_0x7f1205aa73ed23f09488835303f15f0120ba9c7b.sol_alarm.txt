Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions access these mappings concurrently. 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The WETH and USDC variables in ExchangeTokens contract are public, which exposes their state to all external callers. It is advisable to use internal or private visibility to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive variables.
