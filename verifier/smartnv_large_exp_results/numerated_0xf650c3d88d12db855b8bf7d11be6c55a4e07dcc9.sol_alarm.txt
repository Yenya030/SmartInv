The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` in the `execute` function, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` mapping are not specified with appropriate visibility (e.g., `private` or `internal`), which can expose sensitive information or lead to unauthorized access.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract may encounter out-of-gas errors during the execution of functions, especially when transferring tokens or performing complex operations.
4) Cross-bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts (e.g., `votingToken`) without validating external contract behavior, which can introduce inconsistencies or vulnerabilities.
