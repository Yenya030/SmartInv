Contract to be analyzed:

contract Lottery {
     address public owner; 
     uint public totalTickets;
     
     mapping(address => uint) public ticketsBought;

     constructor() {
          owner = msg.sender;
          totalTickets = 0;
     }

     function buyTicket(uint _numTickets) public payable {
          require(msg.value == _numTickets * 0.01 ether, "Incorrect ticket price");
          ticketsBought[msg.sender] += _numTickets;
          totalTickets += _numTickets;
     }

     function pickWinner() public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can pick winner");
          uint winningNum = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp))) % totalTickets;
          address winner;
          // logic to determine winner based on winning number
          // award Ether to winner
     }
}

Output:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
