potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation - the contract seems to lack proper access control mechanisms, which could potentially allow unauthorized users to access critical functions.
2) inconsistent state update - there are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent contract states.
3) atomicity violation - certain operations within functions are not atomic, leading to potential race condition vulnerabilities.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership - the visibility of functions and variables is not specified, which could lead to unintended access and manipulation by external parties.
