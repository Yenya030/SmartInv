The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `lockedFunds` variables are not specified with a visibility modifier (public, internal, private). This could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially expensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`), which might require excessive gas for execution.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to ID collision and unexpected behavior.
5) Ether leakage: There are no mechanisms in place to prevent unintentional loss of ether within the contract, which could result in ether leakage vulnerabilities.
