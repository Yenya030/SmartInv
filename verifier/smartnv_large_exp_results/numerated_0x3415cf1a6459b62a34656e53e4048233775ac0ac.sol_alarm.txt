This contract may have potential vulnerabilities:

- business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract relies on a calculation of price * collateral amount, which could lead to incorrect liquidation decisions.
- inconsistent state update: There is a potential for inconsistent state updates in the liquidate function, where debt and collateral amounts may not be updated correctly.
- arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function could lead to arithmetic flaws if not handled correctly.
