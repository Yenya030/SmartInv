Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any checks or validations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not specified as a visibility, which can lead to issues with contract ownership and access control.
