The contract you provided appears to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without any protection against reentrancy, leaving it vulnerable to inconsistent state updates if reentrancy occurs.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not include any of the required functions such as `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `balanceOf`, etc. This could lead to incorrect visibility issues or ownership problems.

3) Suicidal contracts: There are no specific protections against a possible suicidal contract where a malicious party could attempt to destroy the contract and lose all the funds held in it.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and suicidal contracts.
