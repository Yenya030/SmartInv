Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables such as proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds that are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, possibly leading to inconsistent states.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the required functions like balanceOf and transfer, which may cause issues with the interface implementation.

3) insufficient gas: The execution of functions like endExecute that involve transferring tokens may require a significant amount of gas, potentially causing out-of-gas errors if not enough gas is provided.

4) business logic flaw: The endExecute function uses a condition (votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()) that may not accurately represent the intended business logic, potentially leading to unexpected results.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses addresses as identifiers in mappings like startingBalanceList and may face issues related to ID uniqueness if duplicate addresses are used.

6) ether leakage: There is no explicit handling of Ether transactions in the contract, which may result in accidental Ether transfers or loss of Ether.

Overall, the contract has several potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure its security and proper functionality.
