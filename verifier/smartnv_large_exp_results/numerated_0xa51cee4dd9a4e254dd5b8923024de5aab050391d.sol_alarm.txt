Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update - The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization. This can lead to race conditions and inconsistent state updates.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is declared as internal, potentially allowing unauthorized access to critical functions and data.
3) insufficient gas - The endExecute() function may fail if the gas limit is not sufficient to complete the required operations, leading to incomplete execution.
4) ID uniqueness violation - There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for the proposals, which could result in conflicts and unexpected behavior.
