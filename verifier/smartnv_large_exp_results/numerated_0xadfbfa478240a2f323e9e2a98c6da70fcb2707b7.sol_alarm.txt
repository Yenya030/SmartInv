Contract to be analyzed:
contract MultiSigWallet {
    address[] public owners;
    mapping(address => bool) public isOwner;

    function addOwner(address owner) public {
        require(!isOwner[owner], "Owner already exists");
        owners.push(owner);
        isOwner[owner] = true;
    }

    function removeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(isOwner[owner], "Owner does not exist");
        for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
            if (owners[i] == owner) {
                isOwner[owner] = false;
                owners[i] = owners[owners.length - 1];
                owners.pop();
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
Output: potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation.
