The contract given for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        votes[msg.sender] += _amount;
        totalVotes += _amount;
    }

    function redeemVotes() public {
        uint userVotes = votes[msg.sender];
        require(userVotes > 0, "No votes to redeem");
        totalVotes -= userVotes;
        votes[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(userVotes);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Reentrancy vulnerability in the redeemVotes function.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability in the votes mapping.
