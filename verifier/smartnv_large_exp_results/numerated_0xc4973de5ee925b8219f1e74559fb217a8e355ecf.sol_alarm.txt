The contract provided for analysis is:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint id;
        uint256 voteCount;
        bool voted;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    mapping(address => bool) public votedAddresses;

    uint256 public totalVotes;
    address public admin;

    constructor() public {
        admin = msg.sender;
        totalVotes = 0;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voteCount++;
        totalVotes++;

        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        votedAddresses[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
        
        admin = newAdmin;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect ownership: The changeAdmin function allows for the admin address to be changed by any caller who calls the function, not just the current admin.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The Voter struct has a uint id field, but it is not being utilized or enforced for uniqueness.

3) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of proper synchronization and handling of state updates in the vote function, which could lead to inconsistent data.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution due to potential loops or complex operations, leading to incomplete transactions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect ownership
- ID uniqueness violation
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
