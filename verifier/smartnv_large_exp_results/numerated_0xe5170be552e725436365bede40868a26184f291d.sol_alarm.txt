The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract allows a user to trigger the startExecute function, which initializes a proposal with the caller's address without proper authorization checks. This could lead to privilege escalation if malicious actors exploit this behavior.

2) inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of a proposal directly in the contract state without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) reentrancy: The execute function transfers tokens using transferFrom without implementing the reentrancy guard, potentially exposing the contract to reentrancy attacks.

4) atomicity violation: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is more than double the total supply of the token but calculates and stores the balance separately, which could lead to atomicity violations.

5) ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, but if any external Ether is sent to this contract, it could be lost as the contract does not implement any way to handle it.

6) incorrect visibility/ownership: The access modifiers for variables like lockedFunds, proposal, startingBalanceList, etc., are not specified, which could lead to incorrect visibility and potential unauthorized access.

7) business logic flaw: The endExecute function implementation checks if the balance of the contract is more than double the total supply to determine success, which might not be a correct or secure business logic implementation.
