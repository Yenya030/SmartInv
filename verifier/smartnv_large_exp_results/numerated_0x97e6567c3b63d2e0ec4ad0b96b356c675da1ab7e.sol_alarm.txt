Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or accounts, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The way the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function could potentially lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.
3) Insufficient gas: There might be a risk of running out of gas in functions that involve transferring tokens or executing complex operations, potentially leading to failed transactions or incomplete executions.
