Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated without any checks or restrictions, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not defined in the contract but is being used in the `endExecute` function, which could lead to ownership or visibility issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than available due to multiple state changes and transferring tokens, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple operations that are not atomic, leaving room for unexpected behavior if the function is interrupted midway.
5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially lead to integer overflows or underflows if not handled correctly.
