The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "startExecute" function updates the proposal state without checking if the proposal is currently ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is declared as internal, which could potentially lead to access control vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function does not include a gas stipend for the external call to "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))", which could result in insufficient gas for the operation to complete successfully.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique proposal identifiers, which could lead to conflicts or errors when multiple proposals are created with the same identifier.

Overall, the contract may need further review and adjustments to address these potential vulnerabilities to ensure its security and functionality.
