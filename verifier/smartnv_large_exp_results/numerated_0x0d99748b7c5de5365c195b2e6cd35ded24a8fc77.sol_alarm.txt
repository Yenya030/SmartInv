The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update - The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is being updated directly, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The `votingToken` variable is defined as public, which may expose sensitive information and lead to ownership concerns. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
