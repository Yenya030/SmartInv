The contract provided for analysis:

contract Escrow {
     address public buyer;
     address public seller;
     address public arbiter;
     uint public amount;
     enum State { Created, Locked, Released }
     State public state;

     constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _amount) public {
         buyer = _buyer;
         seller = _seller;
         arbiter = _arbiter;
         amount = _amount;
         state = State.Created;
     }

     function lock() public {
         require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can lock the funds");
         state = State.Locked;
     }

     function release() public {
         require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release the funds");
         state = State.Released;
     }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions `lock` and `release` do not have proper access controls, leading to potential privilege escalation where unauthorized parties can call these functions and change the state of the contract.
