The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `votingToken` and `proposal` are declared with internal visibility, which may not be the intended visibility level for these variables.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the proposal state without any checks for previous proposals, potentially causing inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the loop over the balance of the contract is extensive, leading to insufficient gas for the function execution.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and insufficient gas.
