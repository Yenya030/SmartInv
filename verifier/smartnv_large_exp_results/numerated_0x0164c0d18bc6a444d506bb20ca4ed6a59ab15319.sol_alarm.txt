The contract provided is:

contract Governance {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint => address) public delegates;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function addDelegate(uint id, address delegate) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can add delegates");
        delegates[id] = delegate;
    }
    
    function removeDelegate(uint id) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can remove delegates");
        delete delegates[id];
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) privilege escalation
2) inconsistent state update
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
