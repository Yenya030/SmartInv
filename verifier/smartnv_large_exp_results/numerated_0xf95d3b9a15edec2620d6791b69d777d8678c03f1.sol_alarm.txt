The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal's votedAmount without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract does not specify visibility for the proposal struct, which may lead to unexpected behavior or access control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is insufficient gas to complete the required calculations or transfers.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal addresses, which could lead to issues with duplicate proposals or incorrect data manipulation.
