The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated in the `execute` function, but there is no checking or validation mechanism to ensure that it is updated correctly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which could potentially lead to incorrect access control or ownership-related vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
