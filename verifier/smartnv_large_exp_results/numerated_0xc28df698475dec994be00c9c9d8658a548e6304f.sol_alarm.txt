Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, which could be manipulated if the `execute` function is not properly executed.

2) atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state-changing actions without proper atomicity checks, which could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startExecute` function does not include any access control mechanisms to restrict who can call the function, which could lead to unauthorized execution.

4) business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total supply of the `votingToken`, which may not be a suitable condition for ending execution and could lead to undesirable outcomes.
