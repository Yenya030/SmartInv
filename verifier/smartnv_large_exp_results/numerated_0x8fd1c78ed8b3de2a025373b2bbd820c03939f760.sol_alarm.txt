The contract that needs to be analyzed:

contract Escrow {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    enum State { Created, Locked, Inactive }
    State public state;
    modifier onlySeller {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can call this function");
        _;
    }
    modifier onlyBuyer {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can call this function");
        _;
    }
    constructor() {
        seller = msg.sender;
        state = State.Created;
    }
    function initiate(address _buyer) public onlySeller {
        require(state == State.Created, "Escrow already initiated");
        buyer = _buyer;
        state = State.Locked;
    }
    function confirmReceipt() public onlyBuyer {
        require(state == State.Locked, "Invalid state to confirm receipt");
        state = State.Inactive;
        (bool success, ) = seller.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(success, "Failed to transfer funds to seller");
    }
    function refundBuyer() public onlySeller {
        require(state == State.Locked, "Invalid state to refund buyer");
        state = State.Inactive;
        (bool success, ) = buyer.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(success, "Failed to transfer funds to buyer");
    }
}

Output:
- The contract contains insufficient gas issue in the confirmReceipt and refundBuyer functions.
- The contract might be vulnerable to reentrancy in the confirmReceipt and refundBuyer functions.
