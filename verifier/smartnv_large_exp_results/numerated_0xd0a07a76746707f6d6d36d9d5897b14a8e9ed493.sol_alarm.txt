```solidity
contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only highest bidder can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(highestBid);
    }
}
``` 

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a potential vulnerability in the `bid` function where the `highestBidder` and `highestBid` are updated separately, opening up a possibility for inconsistent state if the second update fails.
2) Reentrancy: The `withdraw` function may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as the transfer of funds to the `highestBidder` is executed before updating the state, allowing potential reentrancy exploit.
