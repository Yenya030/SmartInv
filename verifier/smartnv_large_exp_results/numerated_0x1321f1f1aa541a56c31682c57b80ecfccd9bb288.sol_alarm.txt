The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` struct's `votedAmount` without any synchronization mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a potentially expensive operation with the `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` statement, which may require more gas than available in a single transaction.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is accessed and modified externally, which may have unintended consequences if not properly controlled in terms of visibility and ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
