Vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` struct without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is accessed and updated externally in the `endExecute` function, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function calculates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, which may require significant gas if the contract holds a large amount of tokens.
