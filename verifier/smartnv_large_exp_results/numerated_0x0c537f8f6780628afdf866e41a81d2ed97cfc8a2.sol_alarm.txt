The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt mapping but does not update the collateral mapping for the same user, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate function could potentially lead to arithmetic flaws due to the multiplication and division operations without appropriate checks for overflow or underflow.
