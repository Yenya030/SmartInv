The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract at that moment. This can lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes before the function completes execution.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() performs a potentially expensive operation by checking if the balance of the contract is more than half of the total token supply. This can consume a large amount of gas and possibly lead to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide the necessary functions defined in the interface, which can cause issues with interoperability and ownership of tokens.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
