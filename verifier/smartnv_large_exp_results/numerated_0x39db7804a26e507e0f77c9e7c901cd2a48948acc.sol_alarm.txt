The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) inconsistent state update: The function 'startExecute' updates the 'proposal' struct without properly initializing it, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is declared as public, which exposes it to the public, potentially compromising ownership and access control.
