Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may run out of gas if the number of locked funds is too high, leading to potential failures in the execution.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and ownership control should be carefully reviewed to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation.
