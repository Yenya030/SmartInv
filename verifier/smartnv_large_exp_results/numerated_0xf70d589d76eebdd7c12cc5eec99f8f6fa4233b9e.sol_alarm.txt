Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `internal` visibility for the `owner` variable may not be appropriate depending on the desired behavior of the contract.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.

3) Atomicity violation: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated without proper atomicity checks, potentially leading to race condition vulnerabilities.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions, which may lead to ether leakage vulnerabilities if ether is sent to the contract accidentally.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limit-related issues, which may lead to out-of-gas vulnerabilities in certain scenarios.

6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of IDs for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

7) Business logic flaw: The contract logic for executing proposals and ending execution may have potential flaws or weaknesses, which could be exploited by malicious actors.

Overall, the contract has several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure its security and proper functioning.
