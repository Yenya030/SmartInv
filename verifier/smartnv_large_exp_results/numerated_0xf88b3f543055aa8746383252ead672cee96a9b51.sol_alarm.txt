The contract presented for analysis:

contract Exchange {
     IERC20 public tokenA;
     IERC20 public tokenB;
     
     function swap(uint amountA, uint amountB) external {
          require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountA, "Insufficient balance for tokenA");
          require(tokenB.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountB, "Insufficient balance for tokenB");
          
          tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
          tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);
          
          tokenA.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
          tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountA);
      }
}

Output: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract swaps tokens between users but the state is not updated consistently, which may lead to incorrect balances or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The token balances and transfer functions are accessible externally which may pose a security risk in terms of ownership and privacy.
