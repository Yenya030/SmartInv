The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables are not specified with any visibility modifier, making them publicly accessible. This could lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive data.

2) Reentrancy: The `votingToken.transferFrom` function in the `execute` function could potentially allow for reentrancy attacks if the receiving contract invokes external functions that make additional calls back to the `TimelockController` contract before the current call is completed.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` and `endExecute` functions make multiple external calls and require calculations based on external contract states. If insufficient gas is provided, these functions may fail to execute completely, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Reentrancy, and Insufficient gas.
