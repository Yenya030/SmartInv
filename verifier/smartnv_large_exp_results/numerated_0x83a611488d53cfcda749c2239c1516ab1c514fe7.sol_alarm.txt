The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function could result in an inconsistent state update if the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` does not accurately reflect the intended logic of the contract, leading to incorrect state changes.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable and the `lockedFunds` variable are internal, which may not provide the desired visibility or control over these variables for external interactions. This could lead to ownership concerns or unauthorized access to critical data.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas cost of the operations within the functions, there could be a risk of running out of gas during execution, especially in functions like `endExecute` that perform multiple operations in a sequence.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
