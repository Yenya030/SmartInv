Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly incremented without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which could potentially lead to incorrect visibility or ownership control.
