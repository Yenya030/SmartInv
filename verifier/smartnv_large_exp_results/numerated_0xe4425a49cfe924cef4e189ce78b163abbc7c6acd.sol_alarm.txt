The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `lockedFunds` are updated in different functions without proper synchronization, risking inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is public, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

4) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function may have unintended consequences and could lead to unexpected behavior.

5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could potentially lead to conflicts or errors in the proposal handling process.
