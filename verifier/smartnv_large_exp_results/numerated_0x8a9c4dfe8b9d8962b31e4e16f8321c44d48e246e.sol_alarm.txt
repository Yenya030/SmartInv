Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract is updating the state of the proposal in multiple functions without ensuring atomicity or proper synchronization.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is being used in the contract, but it is unclear if the contract properly implements the required functions.
3) Insufficient gas: The execute function might run out of gas if the execution of the transferFrom function consumes too much gas, leading to a failed transaction.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure uniqueness of proposals, which can lead to conflicts or unexpected results.
