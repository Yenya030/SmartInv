This contract potentially has the following vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'startExecute' function updates the 'proposal' struct without ensuring previous proposals have been completed, potentially leading to inconsistent state. 
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is declared as internal, potentially exposing it to external manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function checks for a condition that may consume excessive gas, leading to potential out-of-gas errors. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
