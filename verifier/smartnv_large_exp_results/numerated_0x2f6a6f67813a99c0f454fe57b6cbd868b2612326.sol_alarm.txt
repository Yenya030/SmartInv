Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility modifiers (e.g., public, external) for functions, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper checks, which can lead to inconsistent state changes.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas optimization in the functions, which may result in out-of-gas errors during contract execution.
4) Arithmetic flaw: There is a calculation in the liquidate function that involves arithmetic operations without proper checks, which can lead to unexpected results. 

Overall potential vulnerabilities: Incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, arithmetic flaw.
