Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, but it does not specify any further actions regarding these locked funds. This could result in an inconsistent state where the locked funds are not handled properly.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the liquidate function, there is a calculation that involves multiplying the price, collateral amount, and a percentage (80/100). If the calculation results in overflow or underflow, it could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the mappings debt and collateral is set to public, which exposes the internal state data to all external parties. This can lead to potential privacy concerns and manipulation of data by unauthorized parties. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, arithmetic flaw, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
