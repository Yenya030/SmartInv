The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the "votedAmount" field of the "Proposal" struct without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "lockedFunds" variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, making it publicly accessible and potentially exposing sensitive information. 

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function relies on the contract having enough gas to complete the required operations, which could result in failure if there is insufficient gas available.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
