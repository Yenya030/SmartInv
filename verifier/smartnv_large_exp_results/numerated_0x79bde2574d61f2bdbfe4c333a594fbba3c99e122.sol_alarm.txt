The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute()` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the transaction was successful, which may lead to inconsistent state if the transfer fails after the variable is updated.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership of functions.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a potentially gas-intensive operation with the `require` statement checking the balance of the contract, which can lead to insufficient gas for the operation to be completed successfully.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
