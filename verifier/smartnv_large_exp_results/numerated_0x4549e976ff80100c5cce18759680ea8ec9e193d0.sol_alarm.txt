The contract in question:

contract PaymentChannel {
    address public sender;
    address public receiver;
    uint256 public depositAmount;

    function openChannel(address _receiver) public payable {
        sender = msg.sender;
        receiver = _receiver;
        depositAmount = msg.value;
    }

    function closeChannel(uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == sender, "Only sender can close the channel");
        require(amount <= depositAmount, "Amount exceeds deposit");
        receiver.transfer(amount);
        depositAmount -= amount;
    }

    function topUp(uint256 amount) public payable {
        require(msg.sender == sender, "Only sender can top up the channel");
        depositAmount += amount;
    }
}

Output:
- potential vulnerability: inconsistent state update
