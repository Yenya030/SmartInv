The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have issues with state updates, especially in functions like `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` where variables are updated without proper synchronization.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables within the contract may not be properly defined, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during certain operations, impacting the execution and completion of critical functions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
