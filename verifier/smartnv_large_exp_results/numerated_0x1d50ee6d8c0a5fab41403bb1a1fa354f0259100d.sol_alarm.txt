Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but is missing the required functions and variables. Make sure to properly implement the interface to avoid potential vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function without any protection against reentrancy or potential race conditions. Consider adding appropriate checks to prevent inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'liquidate' function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs multiple operations including transferring tokens, which may consume a significant amount of gas. Ensure that there is enough gas provided when calling this function to prevent out-of-gas exceptions.
