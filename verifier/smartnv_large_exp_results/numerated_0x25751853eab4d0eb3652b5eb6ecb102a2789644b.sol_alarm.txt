The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentContract are:
1) privilege escalation: The makePayment function allows only the owner to make payments, but the updateOwner function also allows only the owner to update the owner. If an unauthorized user gains access to the owner's account, they can update the owner and subsequently make payments.
2) atomicity violation: The makePayment function does not use any atomic operation while updating the state variable payments[id]. This might lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is set to public, which exposes the owner's address to all users. This might not be desirable for security reasons.
