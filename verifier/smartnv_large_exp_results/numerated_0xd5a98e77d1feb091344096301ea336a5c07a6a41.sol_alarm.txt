The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any further use or reference to it, which may lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables, which may lead to potential issues with visibility and ownership.
3) Insufficient gas: The execution of the `endExecute` function may require a significant amount of gas due to the check `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not handle the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior when multiple proposals are created.
5) Business logic flaw: There is a potential business logic flaw in the `endExecute` function where the condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` may not accurately reflect the desired logic for ending the execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
4) ID uniqueness violation
5) Business logic flaw
