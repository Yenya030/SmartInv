Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation: There are no access control mechanisms implemented in the contract to restrict functions to only authorized users.
- Inconsistent state update: The contract does not consistently update the state of variables after certain actions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
- Atomicity violation: Certain operations in the contract are not wrapped in atomic operations, which could result in partial execution and unexpected outcomes.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of functions and variables, potentially leading to unintended access or modification.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
