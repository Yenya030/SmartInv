The contract to analyze:

contract ExampleContract {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        token.transfer(owner, amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
