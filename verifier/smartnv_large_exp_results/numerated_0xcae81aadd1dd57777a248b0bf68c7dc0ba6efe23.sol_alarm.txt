The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute manipulate the state of the proposal struct in a way that could lead to inconsistent or incorrect data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the functions and variables, which could lead to potential issues with access control.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require a large amount of gas to execute, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external contracts (IERC20, IUniswapV2Pair) which could introduce inconsistencies or vulnerabilities if not handled properly.
