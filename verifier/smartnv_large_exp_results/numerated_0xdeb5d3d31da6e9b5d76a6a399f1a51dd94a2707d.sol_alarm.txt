Output:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'changeOwner' function allows the owner to be changed without proper validation or checks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable should be set to private to prevent direct access and enable proper authorization control.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'swap' function does not have a gas check, which may result in failed transactions due to running out of gas.
