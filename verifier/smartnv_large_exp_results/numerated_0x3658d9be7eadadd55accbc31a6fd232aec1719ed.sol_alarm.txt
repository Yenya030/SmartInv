Contract to analyze:

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;
    uint public exchangeRate;

    constructor(address _tokenA, address _tokenB, uint _exchangeRate) {
        tokenA = IERC20(_tokenA);
        tokenB = IERC20(_tokenB);
        exchangeRate = _exchangeRate;
    }

    function swap(uint amount) public {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        
        uint receivingAmount = amount * exchangeRate;
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, receivingAmount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Integer overflow/underflow: The multiplication in the swap function could potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow if the amount is very large.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the exchangeRate variable is public, which may expose sensitive information about the exchange rate.
- Insufficient gas: If the swap function requires a significant amount of gas to execute, users may encounter insufficient gas issues.
- Business logic flaw: Depending on the specific requirements, there may be a flaw in the business logic of the swap function that could lead to unexpected behavior.
