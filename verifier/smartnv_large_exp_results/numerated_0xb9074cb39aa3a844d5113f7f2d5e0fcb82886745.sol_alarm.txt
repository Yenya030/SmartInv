The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated without proper synchronization or atomic operations, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations being performed without explicit checks for overflow or underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during certain operations, causing them to fail or behave unexpectedly.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions or variables may not be properly defined, leading to potential security risks.
