The contract provided above contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: the function `startExecute()` updates the state of the proposal without checking if a proposal is already in progress or validating the caller properly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the `votingToken` state variable is declared as internal, which makes it accessible internally but not externally, potentially causing issues if external contracts need to interact with it.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
