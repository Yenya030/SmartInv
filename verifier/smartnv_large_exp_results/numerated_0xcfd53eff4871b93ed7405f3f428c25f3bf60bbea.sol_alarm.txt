The contract to analyze is:

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public token1;
    IERC20 public token2;
    
    function swapTokens(uint amount1, uint amount2) public {
        token1.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount1);
        token2.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount2);
        
        token1.transfer(msg.sender, amount2);
        token2.transfer(msg.sender, amount1);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not check if the transfer of tokens is successful before updating the state variables, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility: The state variables token1 and token2 are declared as public, which can expose sensitive information about the contract.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas scenarios during token transfers, which can lead to transactions failing midway.
4) Atomicity violation: The contract does multiple token transfers without ensuring that all transfers are completed successfully in a single transaction, which can lead to inconsistent states if one transfer fails.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, which can result in Ether leakage if unintended Ether transfers occur.
