The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement access control properly. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state changes happening in different functions without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for ensuring unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas limit for transactions, which could result in transactions failing due to running out of gas.

5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility or ownership mechanisms, which can lead to confusion or unauthorized access.
