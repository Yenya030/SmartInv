Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is updated in the 'execute' function without using a safe method like SafeMath, leaving the contract vulnerable to inconsistent state updates.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function may require a significant amount of gas to execute if the condition 'require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()' is not met, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of functions or the ownership of critical operations, which could result in unauthorized access or control over the contract's state. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
