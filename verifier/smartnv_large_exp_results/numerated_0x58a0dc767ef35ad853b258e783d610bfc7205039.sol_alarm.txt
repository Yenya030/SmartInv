Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow or underflow when performing calculations involving amounts.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions should be carefully considered to prevent unintended access or manipulation.
4) Inconsistent state update: There might be inconsistencies in the state of the contract due to improper handling of state changes.
5) Atomicity violation: Operations within functions are not atomic, and there is a possibility of partial execution leading to unexpected outcomes.
