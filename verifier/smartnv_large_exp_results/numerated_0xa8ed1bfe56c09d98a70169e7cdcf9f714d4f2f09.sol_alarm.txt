The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBalanceList` without initializing it first, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The `owner` variable is internal and not properly utilized in the contract, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not properly define the function implementations, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
