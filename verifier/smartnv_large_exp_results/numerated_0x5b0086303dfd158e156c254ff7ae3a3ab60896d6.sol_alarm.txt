        owner = msg.sender;

    function processPayment(uint paymentId, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can process payments");
        payments[paymentId] = amount;

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The processPayment function has a visibility of public, which means anyone can call this function to process payments. This can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of payment data.
2) No input validation: There is no input validation check on the amount parameter in the processPayment function, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as integer overflow/underflow.
3) Lack of access control: The contract only checks for the owner address in the processPayment function, which can lead to privilege escalation if the owner's account is compromised.
4) Lack of error handling: There is no error handling mechanism in place, which can lead to inconsistent state updates or potential vulnerabilities if unexpected exceptions occur during payment processing.
