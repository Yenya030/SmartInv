The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering any conditions regarding its value or implications of updating it.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
