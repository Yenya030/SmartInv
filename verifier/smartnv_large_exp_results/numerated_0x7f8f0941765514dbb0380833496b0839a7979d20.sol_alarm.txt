The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    ERC20 public token;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _token) {
        token = ERC20(_token);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount);
        token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function withdrawTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        token.transfer(owner, amount);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which could potentially expose the owner's address to the public, making it susceptible to attacks.
2) Insufficient gas: The `withdrawTokens` function allows anyone to call it as long as they pass the owner check, which can lead to out-of-gas attacks if the `transfer` function consumes too much gas.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `buyTokens` function does not perform a check to ensure the sender has enough funds to buy the tokens, possibly leading to an inconsistent state if the transaction fails midway.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and inconsistent state update.
