The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is updated in the `startExecute` function without properly resetting the state, potentially causing inconsistent data.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require excessive gas due to loop or complex logic, leading to out-of-gas errors.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs in the contract, which can lead to conflicts or errors.
