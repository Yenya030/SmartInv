The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the sender's balance after transferring tokenB, which could lead to an inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit is not enough to complete the token transfer operations, it may result in a failure in the swap process.
