In the contract you provided, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state (proposal) without checking if the proposal is ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function performs multiple state changes without using a locking mechanism, which could result in atomicity violations.

3) Ether leakage: The endExecute() function transfers the entire balance of the contract to the owner without any check or validation, which could result in ether leakage.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which might not provide the desired level of visibility or ownership control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, ether leakage, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
