Vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct without any checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves a significant gas-intensive operation (checking if the locked funds are more than double the total supply), which may lead to running out of gas.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is unclear if the owner variable is meant to be public or if there are specific ownership controls in place.
