The contract below has potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables and functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.

2) Inconsistent state update:
- The function `execute` updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` directly, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The function `endExecute` checks the balance of the contract before setting `lockedFunds`, which can lead to insufficient gas issue if the contract has a large number of token holders.

4) ID uniqueness violation:
- The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which can lead to conflicts and potential vulnerabilities.

5) Suicidal contracts:
- The contract does not have any mechanisms to prevent or handle malicious behaviors, such as self-destructing the contract, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, Insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, and Suicidal contracts.
