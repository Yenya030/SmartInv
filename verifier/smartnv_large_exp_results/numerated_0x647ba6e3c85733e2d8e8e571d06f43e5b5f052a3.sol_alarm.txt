Vulnerabilities identified in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not check for the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to potential issues if duplicate IDs are created.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `startingBalanceList` without proper validation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is internally scoped and may not be accessible outside the contract, which can lead to ownership control issues.
