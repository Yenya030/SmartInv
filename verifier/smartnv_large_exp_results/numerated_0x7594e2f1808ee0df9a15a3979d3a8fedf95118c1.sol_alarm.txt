Contract to analyze:
contract SimpleToken {
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;
     uint public totalSupply;
     address public owner;

     constructor(uint _totalSupply) public {
         totalSupply = _totalSupply;
         owner = msg.sender;
         balances[msg.sender] = _totalSupply;
     }

     function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         balances[to] += amount;
     }

     function mint(uint amount) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can mint tokens");
         totalSupply += amount;
         balances[owner] += amount;
     }
}
Output:
- correct ownership
- suicidal contracts
