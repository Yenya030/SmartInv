The contract analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is as follows:

contract Vault {
     address public owner;
     uint public balance;
     
     function deposit() public payable {
         balance += msg.value;
     }
     
     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
         balance -= amount;
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow in the balance variable.
2) Insufficient gas issue in the withdraw function.
