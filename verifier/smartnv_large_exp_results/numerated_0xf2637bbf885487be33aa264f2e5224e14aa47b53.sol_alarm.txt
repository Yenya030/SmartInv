Contract analysis:
- The contract potentially contains a reentrancy vulnerability as it calls external contracts (votingToken.transferFrom) without using checks-effects-interactions pattern. 
- The execute function may have an inconsistent state update issue as it updates the proposal state without ensuring atomicity. 
- There is a possibility of insufficient gas issue in the endExecute function as the gas limit for the function execution may exceed the block gas limit.
- The visibility and ownership of the contract functions are not specified, which may lead to incorrect access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) reentrancy
2) inconsistent state update
3) insufficient gas
4) incorrect visibility/ownership
