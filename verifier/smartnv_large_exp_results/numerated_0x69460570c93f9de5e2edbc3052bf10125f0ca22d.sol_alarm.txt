The contract provided for analysis:
contract Auction {
     address public highestBidder;
     uint public highestBid;
     mapping(address => uint) public bids;

     function bid(uint amount) public {
          require(amount > highestBid, "bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
          highestBidder = msg.sender;
          highestBid = amount;
          bids[msg.sender] = amount;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
          require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "cannot withdraw if you are the highest bidder");
          uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
          bids[msg.sender] = 0;
          msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

Output: 
1) atomicity violation
2) inconsistent state update
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
