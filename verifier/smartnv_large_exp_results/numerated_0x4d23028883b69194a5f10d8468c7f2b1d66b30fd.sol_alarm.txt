The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, leaving it open to potential manipulation by external contracts.
2) inconsistent state update: There are potential issues with inconsistent state updates, such as the usage of startingBlance instead of startingBalance in the startExecute function.
3) insufficient gas: If the contract requires a large amount of gas to execute certain functions, it may run out of gas and fail to complete the desired operations.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is a lack of checks to ensure uniqueness of proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
5) atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in operations like updating proposal.votedAmount, which could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple operations are not executed atomically.
