The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update: the execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct without considering potential reentrancy issues.
- Insufficient gas: the endExecute function performs multiple state changes and calculations which may exceed the gas limit, leading to incomplete execution.
