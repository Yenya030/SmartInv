The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any proper synchronization or atomicity measures, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract performs a potentially expensive operation (division) and returns a value without checking for sufficient gas, which may cause the function to fail due to out-of-gas error.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `WETH` and `USDC` variables in the `ExchangeTokens` contract are declared as public, potentially exposing sensitive information about the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Insufficient gas
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
