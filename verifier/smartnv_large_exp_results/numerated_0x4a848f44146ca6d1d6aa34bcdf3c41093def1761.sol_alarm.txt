The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not always update the state variables in a consistent manner, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security issues.
2) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during contract execution, which can result in failed transactions or incomplete operations.
