Contract:

contract TokenSale {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;
    IERC20 public token;

    constructor(address _token) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = IERC20(_token);
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount, "Not enough tokens available");
        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Not enough tokens in balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
}

Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state update in the buyTokens function where the balance of the buyer is updated before transferring the tokens. This could lead to a race condition.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes the owner's address publicly. It is recommended to make ownership information private for security purposes.
