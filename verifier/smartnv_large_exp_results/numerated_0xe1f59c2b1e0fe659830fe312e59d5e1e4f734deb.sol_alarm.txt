Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Privilege escalation: The changeOwner function allows the owner to change the owner address to a new address, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation if not properly restricted.
- ID uniqueness violation: The hasVoted mapping uses the address of the voter as the key, which could potentially lead to ID uniqueness violations if multiple users have the same address.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes the owner's address to all users. This could potentially lead to security risks if malicious users target the owner address.
