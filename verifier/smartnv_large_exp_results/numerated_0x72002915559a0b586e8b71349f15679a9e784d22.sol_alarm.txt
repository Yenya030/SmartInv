The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any further checks, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `debt` and `collateral` mappings are declared as public, which could potentially expose sensitive data to external parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
