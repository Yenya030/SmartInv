Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update:
- The function `startExecute()` updates the state of the `proposal` struct without checking if a proposal is already ongoing, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The `proposal` struct is accessed and updated directly within the contract without any access control mechanism, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposal data.
