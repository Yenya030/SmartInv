Potential vulnerabilities:
- integer overflow/underflow: There is no check or mitigation for potential integer overflow or underflow when handling bid amounts.
- inconsistent state update: The state variables `highestBidder` and `highestBid` are updated independently without ensuring consistency between the two.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of the functions may allow unauthorized access or manipulation of the auction state.
