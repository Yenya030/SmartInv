The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the variables `debt`, `collateral`, and `pair` is set to public, which may expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to these variables.
2) Business logic flaw: The `liquidate` function may have a business logic flaw as it does not handle the case where the transfer of tokens fails, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Price manipulation: The `calculatePrice` function may be vulnerable to price manipulation as it relies on external token balances to calculate the price without proper validation checks. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are incorrect visibility/ownership, business logic flaw, and price manipulation.
