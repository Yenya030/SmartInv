Output:
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or inconsistencies in identifying proposals.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is marked as internal, potentially allowing unauthorized access or modification of the contract state.
