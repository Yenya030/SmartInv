The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the necessary functions and variables to fully comply with it, which can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.
