The contract provided for analysis:

contract SupplyChain {
    uint public totalItems;
    mapping(uint => Item) public items;

    struct Item {
        uint sku;
        string name;
        uint price;
        address payable owner;
        bool exists;
    }

    function createItem(string memory _name, uint _price) public {
        uint _sku = totalItems;
        Item memory newItem = Item(_sku, _name, _price, msg.sender, true);
        items[_sku] = newItem;
        totalItems++;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The SKU generation logic could potentially result in duplicate SKUs, leading to ID uniqueness violations.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" field in the Item struct is public and can be manipulated by external actors, potentially leading to ownership manipulation vulnerabilities.
