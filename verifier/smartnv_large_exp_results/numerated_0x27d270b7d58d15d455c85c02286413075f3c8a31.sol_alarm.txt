The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any proper checks or validations.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, making it publicly accessible.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow issues, such as in the `liquidate()` function in the `calculatePrice()` function.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and integer overflow/underflow.
