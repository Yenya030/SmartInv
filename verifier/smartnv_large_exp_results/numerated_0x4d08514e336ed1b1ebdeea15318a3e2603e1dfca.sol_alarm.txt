This contract may contain potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "lockedFunds" is updated in the "endExecute" function based on the balance of the contract, which may lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes between checks.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is declared as internal, which may lead to unexpected behavior if external contracts or users attempt to access or modify it.
