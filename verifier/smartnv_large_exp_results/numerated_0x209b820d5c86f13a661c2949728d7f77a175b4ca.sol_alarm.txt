Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The update of the proposal's `votedAmount` in the `execute` function does not check for integer overflow.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not explicitly defined with a visibility specifier, potentially leading to ownership issues.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a potential issue with gas exhaustion in the `endExecute` function due to the comparison `*2` could lead to insufficient gas for the contract to complete the transaction.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
5) Business logic flaw: The condition in the `endExecute` function for checking if the execution was successful might not accurately reflect the state of the contract due to the lack of specific success criteria.
