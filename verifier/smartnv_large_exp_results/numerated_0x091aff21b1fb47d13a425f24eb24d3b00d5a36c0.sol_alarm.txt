The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect ownership - the `transferOwnership` function can lead to a privilege escalation vulnerability if not properly restricted to only the owner.
2) integer overflow/underflow - there is a potential for integer underflow in the `withdraw` function if the `amount` exceeds the balance.
