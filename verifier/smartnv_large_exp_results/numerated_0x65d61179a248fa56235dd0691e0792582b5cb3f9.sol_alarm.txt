The possible vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without considering race conditions or reentrancy, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes without ensuring all changes occur atomically, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as public or internal, which can lead to incorrect visibility and potential vulnerabilities in ownership control.
