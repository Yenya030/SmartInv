Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function based on the balance of the contract at that moment, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance changes before the function completes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` storage variables are not explicitly defined with a visibility specifier, which may lead to unexpected accessibility or ownership issues.
