Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, potentially exposing ownership control to unauthorized entities.
- ID uniqueness violation: The `subscriptionId` is generated using `keccak256` of subscriber, duration, and price, which may not guarantee uniqueness and lead to clashes in the mapping.
- Inconsistent state update: In the `renewSubscription` function, the `endTime` of the subscription is updated directly without checking if the new duration extends beyond the current end time, leading to a potential inconsistency in the subscription duration.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider gas costs for operations like `renewSubscription`, which could potentially result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas.
