Contract to analyze:
contract Escrow {
     address public buyer;
     address public seller;
     uint public price;
     uint public releaseTime;
     bool public sellerAgreed;
     bool public buyerAgreed;

     constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, uint _price, uint _releaseTime) {
         buyer = _buyer;
         seller = _seller;
         price = _price;
         releaseTime = _releaseTime;
     }

     function agreeToTerms() public {
         if (msg.sender == buyer) {
             buyerAgreed = true;
         }
         if (msg.sender == seller) {
             sellerAgreed = true;
         }
     }

     function releaseFunds() public {
         require(releaseTime < block.timestamp, "Release time has not yet passed");
         require(sellerAgreed && buyerAgreed, "Both parties must agree to release funds");
         payable(seller).transfer(price);
     }
