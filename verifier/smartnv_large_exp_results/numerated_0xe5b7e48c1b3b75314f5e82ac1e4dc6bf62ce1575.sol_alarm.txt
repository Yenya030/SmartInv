The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have a business logic flaw as it checks if the price of collateral is less than 80% of the debt to decide if a user's funds can be liquidated.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract divides the balance of USDC by the balance of WETH to calculate the price, which could lead to arithmetic flaws if one of the balances is zero.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw and arithmetic flaw.
