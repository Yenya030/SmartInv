The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The setTokenPrice function does not specify the visibility of the function, making it publicly accessible. This may lead to unauthorized parties changing the token price.
2) inconsistent state update: The buyTokens function transfers tokens before updating the sender's balance, which could lead to an inconsistent state if the transfer fails after transferring tokens to the owner.
3) integer overflow/underflow: The totalCost calculation in the buyTokens function could potentially result in an integer overflow if the input values are large.
4) ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, which could allow unintended Ether transfers.
5) insufficient gas: The buyTokens function may fail if the sender does not provide enough gas for the transfers to be completed.
