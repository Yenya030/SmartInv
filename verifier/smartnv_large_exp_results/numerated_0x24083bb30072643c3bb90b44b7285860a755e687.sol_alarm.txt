Potential vulnerabilities in the contract for analysis:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function is updating the votedAmount of the proposal without ensuring that the transfer of tokens is successful, which could lead to inconsistent state if the transfer fails after updating the votedAmount.
2) Atomicity violation: The endExecute function is checking the balance of the contract and updating the lockedFunds variable in separate steps, making the operation non-atomic and susceptible to race conditions.
3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions explicitly, which could lead to unintended ether leakage or loss.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include explicit gas management mechanisms, which could lead to potential failures during contract execution if there is not enough gas supplied.
