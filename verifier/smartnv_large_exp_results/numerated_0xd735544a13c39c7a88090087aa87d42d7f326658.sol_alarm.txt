Contract to be analyzed: 

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    uint public price;
    IERC20 public token;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buy(uint _amount) public {
        uint totalPrice = _amount * price;
        require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= totalPrice, "Insufficient balance");
        require(token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= totalPrice, "Allowance insufficient");
        
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, totalPrice);
        balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
        
    }
    
    function withdrawTokens(address _to, uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw tokens");
        require(balances[_to] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        
        token.transfer(_to, _amount);
        balances[_to] -= _amount;
    }
}

Output:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership

These potential vulnerabilities pertain to the ownership control and visibility of certain functions within the contract.
