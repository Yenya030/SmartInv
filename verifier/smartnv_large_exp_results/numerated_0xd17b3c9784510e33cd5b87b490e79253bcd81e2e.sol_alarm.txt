Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The public visibility of userTokens allows any external party to view the token balances of all users, which can be a privacy concern.
- Insufficient gas: If the token balances of the users become too large, the gas required for functions like swapTokens may exceed the gas limit, leading to transaction failures.
- Atomicity violation: The addition of amountA and amountB to userTokens[msg.sender] is not done atomically, which could lead to inconsistencies if multiple transactions modify the balance simultaneously.
