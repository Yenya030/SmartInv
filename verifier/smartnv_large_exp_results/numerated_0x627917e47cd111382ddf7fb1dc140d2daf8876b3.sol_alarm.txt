Output:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions approveByBuyer, approveBySeller, and approveByArbiter do not have any access control modifier specifying that only the intended parties can call these functions, which could lead to unauthorized parties approving transactions. 
2) Inconsistent state update: The releaseFunds and refundFunds functions rely on specific combinations of approval states, which may not always be correctly updated before these functions are called, leading to inconsistent state changes.
