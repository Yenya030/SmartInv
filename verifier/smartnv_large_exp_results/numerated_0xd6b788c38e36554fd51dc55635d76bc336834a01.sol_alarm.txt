Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without ensuring that the previous proposal has been completed, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does multiple state changes without using any mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which could result in unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas depending on the token transfer operations, and if not enough gas is provided, the function may fail mid-execution.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide implementations for all the required functions, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

5) Reentrancy: The `execute` function interacts with an external contract (the `votingToken`), which could potentially be reentrant and open up vulnerabilities if not properly handled. 

6) Ether leakage: The contract doesn't handle Ether transactions securely, which could lead to Ether leakage if not managed properly.
