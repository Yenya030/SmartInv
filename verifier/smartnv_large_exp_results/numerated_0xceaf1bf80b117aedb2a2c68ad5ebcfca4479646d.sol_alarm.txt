The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation - The contract does not properly check and restrict who can call the `execute()` function, potentially allowing unauthorized parties to execute proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update - The `execute()` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without properly handling concurrency issues, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not define the visibility or access control for the `proposal` variable, which can lead to unexpected behaviors or unauthorized access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
