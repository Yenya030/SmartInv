The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is being updated directly in the `execute` function, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `IERC20 votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, possibly exposing it to external manipulation.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanisms to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or errors.

4) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total supply of the token, which seems like an incorrect business logic.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not have any gas optimization techniques, leading to potential gas inefficiency issues.

6) Ether leakage: There are no checks in place to prevent accidental loss or leakage of Ether in the contract.
