The contract for analysis:
```solidity
contract PaymentContract {
     uint public totalPayment;
     mapping(uint => uint) public payments;
     address private owner;

     constructor() {
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function makePayment(uint paymentId, uint amount) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can make payments");
         payments[paymentId] = amount;
         totalPayment += amount;
     }

     function withdrawAll() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
         payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
         totalPayment = 0;
     }
 }
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
