The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without any proper condition check or validation process.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct is not declared as public or internal, potentially exposing sensitive data.
