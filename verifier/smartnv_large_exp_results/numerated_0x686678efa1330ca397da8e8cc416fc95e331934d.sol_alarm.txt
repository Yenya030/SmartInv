The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without ensuring that it is not already in use.

2) Integer underflow:
   - In the function `liquidate`, there is a risk of integer underflow in the calculation involving `debt[user]`, `collateral[user]`, and the function `getPrice()`.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The visibility of state variables `debt`, `collateral`, and `pair` should be changed to private to prevent unauthorized access.

4) Insufficient gas:
   - The `calculatePrice()` function may require a large amount of gas if the balances of `USDC` and `WETH` are substantial, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors. 

Therefore, the contract provided contains the vulnerabilities mentioned above.
