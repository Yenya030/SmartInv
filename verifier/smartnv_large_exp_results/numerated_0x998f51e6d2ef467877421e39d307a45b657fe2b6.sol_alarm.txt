The contract in question contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The function `endExecute` calculates the `lockedFunds` based on `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, which can be manipulated if the `votingToken` is transferred out before this calculation, leading to incorrect execution.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables like `owner`, `votingToken`, and `proposal`. Visibility should be explicitly defined to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation. 

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflows in the `execute` function when adding to `proposal.votedAmount`, as well as when checking if `startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]` has a valid starting balance.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, incorrect visibility/ownership, and integer overflow/underflow.
