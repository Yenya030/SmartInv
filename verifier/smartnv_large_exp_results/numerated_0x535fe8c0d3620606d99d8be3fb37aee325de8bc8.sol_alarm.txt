Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without properly updating the state variable proposal.addr, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variable proposal is not declared with any visibility specifier, which could lead to potential issues related to visibility and ownership control.
