Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without considering possible race conditions or concurrency issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` address is declared as internal but is not used or enforced anywhere in the contract, potentially leading to ownership control vulnerabilities.
