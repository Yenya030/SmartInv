Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() does not properly update the votedAmount in the proposal struct, which could lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is being used in the contract, but it is not clear if the contract properly implements all the required functions from the interface.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the token balances and total supply, the require statement in the endExecute() function could potentially result in an out-of-gas error if the execution fails.
