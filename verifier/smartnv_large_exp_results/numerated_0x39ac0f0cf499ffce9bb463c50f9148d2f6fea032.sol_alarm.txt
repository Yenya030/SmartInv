Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to specific roles, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute critical functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated without proper synchronization, which could lead to unexpected behavior or state inconsistencies.
3) Insufficient gas: The execution of certain functions may require more gas than the default limit, leading to incomplete execution or failed transactions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain variables and functions is not explicitly defined, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external contracts.
