Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the "proposal" struct is updated in the "startExecute" function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data being accessed by different functions.
2) Atomicity violation: The "execute" function updates the "votedAmount" without proper atomicity control, potentially leading to race conditions and incorrect data manipulation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the "proposal" struct, making it potentially accessible by external contracts and compromising data privacy and security.
