Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not specify visibility for the functions and variables, which could lead to potential accessibility issues.
2) inconsistent state update - The state variables like proposal struct and lockedFunds are being updated without proper synchronization, which could result in inconsistent data.
3) insufficient gas - The endExecute function checking for execution failure based on a gas-heavy operation might run out of gas, leading to an incomplete execution.
4) ID uniqueness violation - There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or addresses, potentially causing conflicts or errors in the execution flow.
5) ether leakage - There is a possibility of accidental ether leakage due to transfer operations not being handled properly, leading to loss of funds.
