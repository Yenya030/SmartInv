Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:
1) Inconsistent state update:
- The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable, but it is not clear where this variable is declared or how it is being used in the contract. This could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but does not define any of the required functions such as `balanceOf`, `transfer`, etc. This could result in incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect these functions to be present.

3) Insufficient gas:
- There is a lack of gas estimation or management in the contract, which could result in transactions running out of gas before completing successfully.

4) Business logic flaw:
- The condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` in the `endExecute` function seems to be a business logic check, but it's not clear why it is needed or how it affects the execution of the contract. This condition may introduce a flawed logic or unintended consequences.
