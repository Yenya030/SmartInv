Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation - The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to confusion or conflict in handling different proposals.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not specified, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation by external parties.
3) Insufficient gas - The functions in the contract may require more gas than provided in certain scenarios, leading to incomplete execution or unexpected behavior.
