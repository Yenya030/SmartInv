Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ```owner``` variable is defined as internal, which may expose the ownership logic to potential manipulation by external contracts.

2) Inconsistent state update: The ```lockedFunds``` variable is updated in the ```endExecute``` function without proper synchronization or atomicity checks.

3) Privilege escalation: The ```proposal``` struct and related functions do not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from starting, executing, or ending proposals.

4) Business logic flaw: The business logic in the ```endExecute``` function, where the execution is considered failed if the balance of the contract is not twice the total supply of the token, may lead to unexpected outcomes and potential vulnerabilities.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract may face gas-related vulnerabilities due to the complexity of the functions and potential gas limit constraints during execution.

6) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs or addresses in the contract, which could lead to conflicts and vulnerabilities.

7) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, which may result in potential ether leakage vulnerabilities.
