This contract potentially contains the following vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field in the `proposal` struct directly, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which may lead to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities related to data visibility.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
