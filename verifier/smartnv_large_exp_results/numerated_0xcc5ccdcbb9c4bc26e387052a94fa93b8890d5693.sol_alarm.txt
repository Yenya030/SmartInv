The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function based on the balance of the contract, which could lead to inconsistencies if multiple transactions are executed simultaneously.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not actually include the required functions or variables, so there may be issues with visibility or ownership.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute()` function may require more gas than provided, leading to potential execution failures.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
