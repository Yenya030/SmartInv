Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not define any of the required functions such as balanceOf, transfer, allowance, etc.
2) inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal's votedAmount without using the SafeMath library, potentially leading to inconsistencies.
3) atomicity violation: The execute function transfers tokens and updates state variables without using the appropriate checks to ensure atomicity.
4) inconsistent state update: The endExecute function calculates lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract at the time of execution, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
