The contract provided for analysis is:

contract Vesting {
     IERC20 public token;
     address public beneficiary;
     uint public start;
     uint public cliff;
     uint public duration;
     uint public totalAmount;
     uint public released;
     mapping(uint => uint) public releaseSchedule;
    
     constructor(IERC20 _token, address _beneficiary, uint _start, uint _cliff, uint _duration, uint _totalAmount, uint[] memory _releaseSchedule) {
          token = _token;
          beneficiary = _beneficiary;
          start = _start;
          cliff = _cliff;
          duration = _duration;
          totalAmount = _totalAmount;
          for (uint i = 0; i < _releaseSchedule.length; i++) {
               releaseSchedule[i] = _releaseSchedule[i];
          }
     }

     function release() public {
          require(block.timestamp > start, "Vesting has not started yet");
          uint unreleased = releasableAmount();
          require(unreleased > 0, "No tokens to release");
          released = released + unreleased;
          token.transfer(beneficiary, unreleased);
     }

     function releasableAmount() public view returns (uint) {
          uint vested = 0;
          for (uint i = 0; i < releaseSchedule.length; i++) {
               if (block.timestamp >= start + releaseSchedule[i]) {
                    vested = vested + totalAmount / releaseSchedule.length;
               }
          }
          return vested - released;
     }
}

Output: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may suffer from inconsistent state updates as the 'released' state variable is updated without proper synchronization, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Arithmetic flaw: There is a potential arithmetic flaw in the 'releasableAmount' function where the calculation of 'vested' amount may lead to incorrect results due to improper handling of integer division and addition operations. 
3) Business logic flaw: There might be a business logic flaw in the 'releasableAmount' function that could impact the distribution of vested tokens based on the release schedule provided. 

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, arithmetic flaws, and business logic flaws.
