The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to have any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs or addresses, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not properly specified, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
