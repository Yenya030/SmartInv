The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state of the `proposal` struct without initializing it first, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the required functions from the interface, which may lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
