Contract:

contract Escrow {
    mapping(address => uint) public deposits;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(deposits[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        deposits[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership
