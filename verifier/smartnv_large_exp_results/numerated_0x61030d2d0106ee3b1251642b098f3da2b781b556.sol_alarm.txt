The contract in question contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function does not account for all possible scenarios and may lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is defined as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during certain operations due to lack of gas optimization.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or other elements within the contract.
