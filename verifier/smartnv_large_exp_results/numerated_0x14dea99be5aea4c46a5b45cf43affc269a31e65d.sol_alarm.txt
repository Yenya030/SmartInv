Potential vulnerabilities:
1) integer overflow/underflow: The function startExecute() has an integer underflow vulnerability with the 'uint256 startingBalance' variable.
2) inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the startingBalanceList state without checking if the proposal was successfully created.
3) insufficient gas: The execute() and endExecute() functions do not specify the gas limit, which can lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
