The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the `proposal` struct to track proposals and their information but does not properly update the state of the `proposal` struct in the `execute` and `endExecute` functions leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify proper visibility for the `proposal` struct and the `votingToken` variable, potentially exposing sensitive information to external parties.

3) Reentrancy: The `execute` function transfers tokens before updating the state of the `proposal` struct, which could potentially allow reentrancy attacks if the transferred tokens trigger calls to external contracts.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract without proper checks for integer overflow/underflow, such as in the `liquidate` function of the `ExchangeTokens` contract.

5) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function uses a condition that checks if the balance of the contract is greater than double the total supply of the token, which may not be the intended business logic and could lead to unexpected behavior.

6) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include a function to destroy or self-destruct the contract, which could potentially lead to the contract being stuck indefinitely.

7) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include checks for ensuring that there is enough gas for executing certain functions, which could lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
