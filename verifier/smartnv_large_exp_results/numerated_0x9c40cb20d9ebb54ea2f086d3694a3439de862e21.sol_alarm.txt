The potential vulnerabilities in the MultiSigWallet contract are:

1) Atomicity violation: The function executeTransaction doesn't have proper atomicity checks on the execution of the transaction, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The execution of transactions in the executeTransaction function might require more gas than provided, leading to the failure of the transaction execution.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the executeTransaction and submitTransaction functions could allow unauthorized access to execute transactions or submit unauthorized transactions.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is a possibility of transactionId collision, resulting in unexpected behavior when referring to transactions.
5) Privilege escalation: There are no checks in place to prevent a single owner from submitting and executing transactions, potentially leading to privilege escalation issues.
