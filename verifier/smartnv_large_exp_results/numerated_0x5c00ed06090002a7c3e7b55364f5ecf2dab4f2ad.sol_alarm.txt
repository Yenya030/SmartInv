The contract is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function in the contract updates the votedAmount of the proposal directly within the function, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions attempt to update the same proposal simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for the variable. This could potentially lead to ownership control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require excessive gas if there is a large number of tokens in the contract, potentially causing the function to fail due to insufficient gas.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for proposal IDs, which could lead to potential conflicts or errors in tracking proposals.
5) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in the contract has a business logic flaw where it liquidates a user's funds based on a fixed percentage of the collateral and debt, which may not accurately reflect the actual financial situation of the user.
