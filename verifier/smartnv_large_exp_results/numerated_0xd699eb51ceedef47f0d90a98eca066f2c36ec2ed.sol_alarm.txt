The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;
    
    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function resetVotes() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can reset votes");
        totalVotes = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Privilege escalation: The resetVotes function allows the owner to reset the totalVotes, potentially giving them undue influence over the voting system.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is mentioned in the resetVotes function but not defined in the contract, which can lead to ownership issues.
