The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The deposits mapping is updated in the deposit function and withdraw function without properly checking for potential inconsistencies or race conditions.
2) Integer underflow: The subtraction in deposits[msg.sender] -= amount; could lead to an integer underflow if the amount is larger than the deposited value.
3) Insufficient gas: If the withdraw function sends funds to a contract that does not implement a fallback function or runs out of gas, the transaction could fail, leaving the user's funds locked in the contract.
