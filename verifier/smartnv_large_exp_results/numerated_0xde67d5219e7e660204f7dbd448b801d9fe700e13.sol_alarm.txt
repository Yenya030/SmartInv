The contract provided for analysis contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract without considering the possibility of external changes to the contract's balance.

2) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute()` function checks for a condition related to the contract's balance and the total token supply which may not accurately reflect the execution status of the proposal.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions that involve transferring tokens.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, business logic flaw, and insufficient gas.
