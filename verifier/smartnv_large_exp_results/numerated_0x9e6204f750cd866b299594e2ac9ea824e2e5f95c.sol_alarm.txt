In the contract provided, potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function in the TimelockController contract may have a business logic flaw where the execution may fail even if the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` is met due to incorrect logic.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function in the TimelockController contract updates the `startingBalanceList` mapping but does not initialize the `startingBalanceList` before updating, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable in the TimelockController contract is not specified with a visibility modifier, which can lead to potential issues with contract ownership and accessibility. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
