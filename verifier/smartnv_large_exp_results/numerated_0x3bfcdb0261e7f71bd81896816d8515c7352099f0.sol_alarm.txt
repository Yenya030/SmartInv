The contract provided for analysis is:

contract FoodCoin {
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         balances[to] += amount;
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
1) Integer overflow/underflow
2) Insufficient gas
3) Inconsistent state update
