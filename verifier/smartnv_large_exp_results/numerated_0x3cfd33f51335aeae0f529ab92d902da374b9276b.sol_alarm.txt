The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:

Contract:
contract Purchase {
    uint public price;
    address public owner;
    address public buyer;

    function setPrice(uint _price) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can set price");
        price = _price;
    }

    function buy() public payable {
        require(msg.value == price, "incorrect payment amount");
        owner.transfer(msg.value);
        buyer = msg.sender;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "setPrice" function allows anyone to set the price of the item, which should only be allowed by the owner.
2) Insufficient gas: The "buy" function transfers funds directly to the owner, which could potentially fail if the owner's contract does not have enough gas to receive the transfer.
3) Inconsistent state update: The "buyer" variable is updated after transferring funds to the owner, which could lead to inconsistent state if the transfer fails after updating the variable.
