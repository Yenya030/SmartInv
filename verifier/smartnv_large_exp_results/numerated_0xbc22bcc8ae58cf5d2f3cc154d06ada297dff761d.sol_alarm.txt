The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract VoteSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public voteCount;
    bool public isVotingOpen;

    function startVoting() external {
        require(!isVotingOpen, "voting is already open");
        isVotingOpen = true;
    }

    function vote(uint _choice) external {
        require(isVotingOpen, "voting is not open");
        voteCount[msg.sender] = _choice;
    }

    function endVoting() external {
        require(isVotingOpen, "voting is not open");
        isVotingOpen = false;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

3) business logic flaw: 
- The contract does not have any specific rules or logic for handling the voting process. There is no validation for the choice being made by the voters, potentially allowing for unfair or inaccurate voting results.

14) incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The `voteCount` mapping is declared as public, exposing the voting choices of all addresses in the blockchain. This could lead to privacy concerns and manipulation of voting outcomes.
