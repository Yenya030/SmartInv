Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs associated with proposals. This could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if duplicate IDs are allowed.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field directly, which could potentially lead to inconsistent state if not properly synchronized with other parts of the contract.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility or ownership modifiers for certain functions or variables, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by unauthorized parties. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
