The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without checking if the conditions for unlocking funds are met, potentially allowing for improper state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal()` function is referenced, but its visibility is not specified, which can lead to issues related to access control and ownership.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
