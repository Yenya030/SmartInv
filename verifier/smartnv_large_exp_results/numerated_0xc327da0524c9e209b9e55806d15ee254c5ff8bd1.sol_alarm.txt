Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) business logic flaw: The liquidation function in the contract might have a business logic flaw as the condition for liquidating a user's funds might not be appropriately calculated.
2) arithmetic flaw: There could be a potential arithmetic flaw in the liquidate function where the calculation of (getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100) might lead to unexpected results due to integer division.
