Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the proposal's votedAmount without properly handling a potential race condition.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables owner and votingToken are marked internal, which may expose them to potential unauthorized access.
- Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required transfer of tokens.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or inconsistencies in the system.
