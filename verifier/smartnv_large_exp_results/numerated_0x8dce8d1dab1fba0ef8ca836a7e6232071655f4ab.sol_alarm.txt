The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated within the `execute` function, but the `votedProposal` function is not provided in the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
