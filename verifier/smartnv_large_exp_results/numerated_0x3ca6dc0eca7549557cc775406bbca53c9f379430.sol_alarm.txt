The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update as the swapTokens function involves multiple state changes that could go wrong under certain conditions.
- Insufficient gas: If the contract does not have enough gas provided for the execution of swapTokens function, the transaction might fail and leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
