The contract provided for analysis:

contract Governor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public proposals;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, exposing it to the public. Consider changing it to private and adding a getter function if necessary.
