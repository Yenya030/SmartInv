The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Integer Overflow/Underflow: 
   - In the function endExecute(), the comparison "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" could result in an overflow if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 exceeds the maximum value that uint256 can hold.

2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: 
   - The visibility of the variables proposal, startingBalanceList, lockedFunds, and owner is not specified, which could lead to potential data leakage or unauthorized access.

3) Inconsistent State Update: 
   - In the function startExecute(), the proposal struct is updated without checking if a valid proposal is in progress, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Integer Overflow/Underflow, Incorrect Visibility/Ownership, and Inconsistent State Update.
