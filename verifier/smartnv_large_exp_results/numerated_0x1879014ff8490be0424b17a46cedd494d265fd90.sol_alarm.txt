Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` modifies the `startingBalanceList` mapping without updating the `proposal` state variable, which could lead to an inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute if the gas provided is not enough to complete the operation, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which may expose it to potential manipulation by external contracts. It should be declared as `private` to restrict access.

Overall assessment: The contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
