Contract example:
```solidity
contract Escrow {
    uint public amount;

    function deposit(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0, "Invalid deposit amount");
        amount += _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount <= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        amount -= _amount;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not check for potential overflow/underflow when handling the amount variable in the deposit and withdraw functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerability in the contract is integer overflow/underflow.
