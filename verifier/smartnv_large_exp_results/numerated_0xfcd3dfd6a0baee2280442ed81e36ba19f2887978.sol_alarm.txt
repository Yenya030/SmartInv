Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings, which could lead to inconsistencies if certain conditions are not properly checked and updated.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables debt, collateral, WETH, USDC, and pair in ExchangeTokens contract are public, which could expose sensitive information and allow unauthorized access to these variables. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
