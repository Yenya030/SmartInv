Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if there is an existing proposal already present. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface `IERC20`, but it does not have the required functions of an ERC20 token such as `balanceOf()` and `transfer()`. This can lead to incorrect visibility and ownership control.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function checks for a condition where the balance of the contract needs to be twice the total supply of the token, which can potentially require a large amount of gas to execute and may result in an out-of-gas error.
4) Business logic flaw: The `execute()` function does not handle the case where the transfer of tokens fails, which can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract's execution flow.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure that the proposals have unique identifiers, which can lead to conflicts or ambiguities in the proposal management system.
