The contract provided for analysis is:

contract SecureTokenSale {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    uint256 public price = 1 ether;

    function buyTokens(uint256 amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Price manipulation
2) Integer overflow/underflow
3) Insufficient gas
