Potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any checks or validations, which could lead to inconsistent state if not handled properly.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which might not be intended and could potentially lead to incorrect access control or visibility issues.
