Based on the provided contract, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute()" updates the "lockedFunds" variable without implementing proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure the consistency of the state.

2) Atomicity violation: The function "endExecute()" calculates the balance of the contract and updates the "lockedFunds" variable in separate steps, which could lead to race conditions and atomicity violations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the "votingToken" variable, which could lead to potential issues with access control and ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are related to inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
