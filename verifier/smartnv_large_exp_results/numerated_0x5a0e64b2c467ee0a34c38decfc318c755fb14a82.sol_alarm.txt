The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct, but this update is not done atomically, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Atomicity violation: The execute function does not perform an atomic transfer of tokens, as the votingToken.transferFrom and the update of votedAmount in the proposal struct are not part of the same transaction, leaving room for potential issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a loop over all balances to check if the execution should proceed, which can lead to running out of gas and failing the transaction.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined or implemented, leaving potential vulnerabilities in terms of who has control over critical functions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
