The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` of a proposal without using the `proposal` struct, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not specified with a visibility modifier, making it public by default and potentially exposing sensitive information.
3) business logic flaw: The calculation in the `endExecute` function to check if the execution has failed might not accurately assess the situation, leading to potential business logic flaws.
