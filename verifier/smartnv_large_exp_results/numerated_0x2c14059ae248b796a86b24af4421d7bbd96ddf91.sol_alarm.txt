This contract may have potential vulnerabilities:

1) atomicity violation: The execution of the "execute" function involves multiple state changes without being wrapped in a single transaction. This could lead to inconsistencies or undesired effects if one of the state changes fails.

2) inconsistent state update: In the "endExecute" function, the check for the end of execution and the status of the proposal are done separately. This could lead to a situation where the execution ends but the proposal state is not updated accordingly.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is internal, which means it can be accessed by contracts in the same hierarchy. This might not follow the intended ownership logic.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
