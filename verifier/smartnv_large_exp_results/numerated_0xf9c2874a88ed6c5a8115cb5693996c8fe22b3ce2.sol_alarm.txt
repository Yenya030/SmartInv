Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without considering potential reentrancy issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not define the required functions, which could lead to incorrect behavior or ownership vulnerabilities.
