The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any additional checks or restrictions, potentially leading to unintended behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are declared as public, which exposes sensitive information about user's debt and collateral to anyone on the blockchain. 

3) Insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice()` function may require additional gas to execute if the balance of USDC or WETH is significantly high, potentially leading to out of gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
