Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `lockedFunds`, `votingToken`, and `startingBalanceList` are not defined in the contract, which could lead to issues with visibility and ownership.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than available due to multiple token transfers and calculations, leading to potential transaction failures.
4) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single transaction, leading to potential atomicity violations.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, potentially leading to conflicts or errors in proposal handling.
