The contract to analyze:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid); 
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBid = 0;
    }
}

Output:
1) Reentrancy vulnerability
2) Insufficient gas
3) Atomicity violation
