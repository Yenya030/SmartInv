The code snippet you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows the startExecute function to be called externally, which could potentially allow an unauthorized user to start a proposal.

2) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract is more than double the total token supply, which might not be the intended logic.

3) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without using atomic operations, which could lead to inconsistent state.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is marked as internal which might not be the intended visibility level for this variable.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are privilege escalation, business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
