The contract to analyze is:

```
contract MyToken {
         uint public totalSupply;
         mapping(address => uint) public balanceOf;
         address public owner;

         function mint(address account, uint amount) public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can mint");
             totalSupply += amount;
             balanceOf[account] += amount;
         }

         function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
             require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "insufficient balance");
             balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
             balanceOf[to] += amount;
         }

         function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can transfer ownership");
             owner = newOwner;
         }
     }
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
2) Privilege escalation
