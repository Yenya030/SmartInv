The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - In the function endExecute(), the check for execution failure is based on the comparison of the balance of the contract with double the total supply of the voting token, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance is manipulated.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The owner variable is declared as internal, which may allow unauthorized access to critical functions or variables.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
