Contract TimelockController is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) inconsistent state update: proposal.votedAmount is being updated without proper synchronization or atomicity guarantees, which could lead to incorrect state.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not seem to have the required functions and variables, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or ownership issues.

Contract ExchangeTokens is healthy.
