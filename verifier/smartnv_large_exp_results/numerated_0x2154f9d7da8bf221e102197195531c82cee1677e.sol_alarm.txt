The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable proposal, but it does not check for the current state of the proposal properly, potentially causing inconsistent state updates.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or errors in the system.
3) Arithmetic flaw: The function endExecute() has an arithmetic flaw in the comparison of balances that could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the system. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) ID uniqueness violation
3) Arithmetic flaw
