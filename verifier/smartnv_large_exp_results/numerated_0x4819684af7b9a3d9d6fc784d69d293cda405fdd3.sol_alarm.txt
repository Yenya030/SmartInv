This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct without checking if there is an existing proposal in progress.
2) atomicity violation: The function execute() is not ensuring atomicity when updating the votedAmount variable.
3) cross bridge inconsistency: The function endExecute() accesses the balance of the votingToken contract and may lead to inconsistency across different contracts if the balances are not synchronized.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but it is not defining all the required functions (e.g., balanceOf, transfer). 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are: inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, cross bridge inconsistency, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
