Possible vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is public, meaning anyone can access and potentially modify it, which can lead to privilege escalation.
2) Integer overflow/underflow - In the buyTokens function, there is a multiplication involving msg.value and tokenPrice, which can potentially lead to integer overflow/underflow.
3) Incorrect payment amount - The buyTokens function checks if the payment amount is equal to the product of _amount and tokenPrice, but this comparison might not handle all edge cases and could lead to inconsistencies.
4) Inconsistent state update - There is no check for token transfer success in the buyTokens function, which can result in inconsistent state if the transfer fails.
5) Ether leakage - In the withdrawFunds function, transferring the balance directly to the owner's address can lead to ether leakage if the owner's address is a contract that does not handle received ether properly.
