The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
    - The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state without initializing it, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
    - The `proposal` struct is not properly defined and referenced, leading to potential issues with visibility and ownership control.

3) Atomicity violation:
    - The `execute()` function performs multiple state changes without using proper locking mechanisms, leading to potential atomicity violations.

4) Reentrancy:
    - The `endExecute()` function does not have proper checks to prevent reentrancy attacks, which can be exploited by malicious users.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, atomicity violation, and reentrancy.
