Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There are mappings for debt and collateral using the user's address as the key. If there is no check to ensure that each user has a unique address, there could be a violation of ID uniqueness.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions in the contract are not specified with visibility modifiers (e.g., public, private, internal), which could lead to potential issues related to data access and contract ownership.
