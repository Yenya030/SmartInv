The contract provided for analysis:

contract Crowdsale {
   address public owner;
   uint public endTime;
   uint public totalTokens;

   constructor(address _owner, uint _endTime, uint _totalTokens) {
      owner = _owner;
      endTime = _endTime;
      totalTokens = _totalTokens;
   }

   function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
      require(block.timestamp < endTime, "Crowdsale has ended");
      // Transfer tokens to buyer
   }

   function withdrawFunds() public {
      require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
      // Withdraw funds
   }
}

Output: 
1) incorrect visibility/ownership
