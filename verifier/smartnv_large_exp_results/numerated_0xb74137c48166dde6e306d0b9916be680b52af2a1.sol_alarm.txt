Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not show the functions required by the interface. This could lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount of the proposal is incremented without any checks on the maximum allowed amount. This could lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that requires calculating the balance of the contract multiplied by two. This could lead to running out of gas if the contract has a large number of token holders.
