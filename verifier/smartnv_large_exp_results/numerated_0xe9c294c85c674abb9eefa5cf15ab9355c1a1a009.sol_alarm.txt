The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state in the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variables and functions is not specified, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during contract execution, especially in functions like `endExecute()` that perform multiple operations in a single call.

4) Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws in the contract that could be exploited by malicious users to manipulate the behavior of the contract.

5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs or proposals, which could lead to conflicts and unexpected behavior in the contract.
