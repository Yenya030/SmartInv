The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without initializing it, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Business logic flaw: The condition in the `liquidate()` function in the contract `ExchangeTokens` may lead to incorrect liquidation of funds, as it uses the `getPrice()` function but the contract defines a different function `calculatePrice()`. This inconsistency could result in incorrect liquidation decisions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `USDC` and `WETH` variables in the `ExchangeTokens` contract are marked as public, potentially exposing sensitive information about the contract's state.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, business logic flaw, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
