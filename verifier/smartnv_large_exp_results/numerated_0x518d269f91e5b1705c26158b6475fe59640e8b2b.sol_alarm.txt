This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is set to internal which might lead to unexpected behavior or security risks.
- Inconsistent state update: The proposal struct is not properly initialized in the startExecute function, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, the operations in the contracts may not have enough gas to execute successfully.
- Incorrect arithmetic: The calculation in the calculatePrice function may lead to potential arithmetic flaws.
- Ether leakage: There are no checks in place to prevent unintended transfers of Ether, which could result in Ether leakage vulnerabilities.
