The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: When the `startExecute` function is called, the `proposal` struct is updated without checking if there is an existing proposal already in progress. This could lead to inconsistent state updates and possibly unintended behavior.

2) Atomicity violation: In the `execute` function, the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without using proper synchronization mechanisms to ensure atomicity. This could potentially lead to race conditions or incorrect values being stored.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `IERC20` interface is being inherited by the contract, but it is unclear if the contract has the correct visibility or ownership settings for the functions defined in the interface. This could lead to unexpected access control issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Atomicity violation, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
