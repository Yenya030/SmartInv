The vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is being updated in the "endExecute" function based on a condition that checks the balance of the contract. This can lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance changes between the check and the update.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votedProposal" function is called in the "execute" function but is not defined in the contract. This could be an issue of incorrect visibility or ownership.

3) Business logic flaw: The condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");" in the "endExecute" function may have a business logic flaw as it is not clear why the balance of the contract needs to be double the total supply of the token for execution to be successful. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
