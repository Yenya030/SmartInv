Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without taking into account any checks or validations, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks for a condition that involves a potentially high gas cost operation (computing the total balance of the contract multiplied by 2), which may result in insufficient gas to execute the function successfully.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the "votingToken" variable, which could lead to issues related to accessibility and ownership control.
