The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentGateway contract are:
1) privilege escalation: The setOwner function allows the owner to change the owner address, which could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to escalate their privileges.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is set as public, which could expose sensitive ownership information to external parties.

Therefore, the contract has potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure its security.
