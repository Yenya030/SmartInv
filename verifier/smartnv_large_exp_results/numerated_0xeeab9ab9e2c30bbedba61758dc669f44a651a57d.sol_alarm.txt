The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract VotingSystem {
     struct Proposal {
          uint256 startTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address proposer; 
          }
     address  public owner;
     IERC20 public votingToken;
     mapping(address => uint256) public startingBalanceList;

    function createProposal() external {
              Proposal memory proposal;
              proposal.startTime = block.timestamp;
              proposal.proposer = msg.sender;
              startingBalanceList[msg.sender] = getStartingBalance(msg.sender); 
        }

    function vote(uint256 amount) external {
              // Logic for voting
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The createProposal function does not specify any conditions or checks for creating a proposal, leaving it open to potential misuse or unintended behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The voting function is mentioned but not implemented, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or incorrect behavior if not handled properly.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is defined as public, which can potentially expose sensitive information and impact the ownership control of the contract.
