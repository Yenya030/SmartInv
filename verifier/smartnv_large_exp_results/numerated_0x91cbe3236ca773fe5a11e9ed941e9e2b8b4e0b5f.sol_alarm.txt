The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the state of `proposal` without initializing it, which can lead to inconsistent state data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface, but it does not provide implementations for all the required functions in the interface.

3) Business logic flaw: In the `endExecute()` function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` may not accurately determine the success or failure of the execution.

4) Atomicity violation: Operations within functions such as `execute()` are not enclosed within a single transaction, leading to issues if one part of the operation fails after another part has already been executed.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider potential gas limitations for certain operations, potentially causing them to fail if there is not enough gas available.

6) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not implement checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow in various arithmetic operations, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

7) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transfers securely, potentially allowing for Ether leakage.

8) Suicidal contracts: There are no protective measures in place to prevent the contract from being destructed, which could result in the loss of funds or disruption of the contract's functionality.

9) Privilege escalation: Certain functions or operations may allow for unauthorized escalation of privileges, leading to potential security breaches.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Business logic flaw
4) Atomicity violation
5) Insufficient gas
6) Integer overflow/underflow
7) Ether leakage
8) Suicidal contracts
9) Privilege escalation
