Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is declared as internal which could allow external contracts to access or modify it.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without proper synchronization or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations in the contract that involve addition or subtraction of amounts without proper checks for potential overflow or underflow.
