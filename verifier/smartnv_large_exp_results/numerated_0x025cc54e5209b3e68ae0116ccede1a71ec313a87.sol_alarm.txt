The contract to analyze:

contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint => uint) public payments;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function processPayment(uint paymentId, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can process payments");
        payments[paymentId] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawPayment(uint paymentId) public {
        require(payments[paymentId] > 0, "No funds available for withdrawal");
        msg.sender.transfer(payments[paymentId]);
        payments[paymentId] = 0;
    }
}
