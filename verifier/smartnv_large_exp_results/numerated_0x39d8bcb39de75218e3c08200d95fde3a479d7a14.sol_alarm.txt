The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract Crowdsale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public contributions;
    uint public totalContributions;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function contribute() public payable {
        contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        totalContributions += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can withdraw funds");
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Crowdsale contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (withdrawFunds can be accessed by anyone)
- Insufficient gas (possible gas limit issues when withdrawing funds)

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the Crowdsale contract are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
- insufficient gas
