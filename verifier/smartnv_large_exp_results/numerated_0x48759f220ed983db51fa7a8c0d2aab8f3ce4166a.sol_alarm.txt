Potential vulnerabilities:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - The 'owner' variable is initialized in the constructor without specifying visibility (public, private, internal, external). This can potentially lead to access control issues.
2) inconsistent state update - The balances are updated in the 'deposit' function but can be manipulated later without proper checks in the 'withdraw' function.
3) insufficient gas - The 'withdraw' function transfers Ether to the sender without specifying a gas stipend, which can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) integer overflow/underflow - There are no checks for potential integer overflows or underflows in the calculations involving balances and withdrawals.
