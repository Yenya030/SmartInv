The contract you provided is:
contract Lottery {
     address public owner;
     uint public ticketPrice;
     mapping(address => uint) public playerTickets;
     address[] public players;
     uint public totalTickets;
     
     constructor() {
         owner = msg.sender;
         ticketPrice = 1 ether;
         totalTickets = 0;
     }
     
     function buyTickets(uint numTickets) public payable {
         require(msg.value == numTickets * ticketPrice, "Incorrect amount sent");

         for (uint i = 0; i < numTickets; i++) {
             playerTickets[msg.sender]++;
             totalTickets++;
             players.push(msg.sender);
         }
     }
     
     function drawWinner() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can draw winner");
         
         uint winnerIndex = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty, players.length))) % players.length;
         address winner = players[winnerIndex];
         
         payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Lottery contract are:
1) Insufficient gas - The function drawWinner may require more gas than is available in a single block, causing the transaction to fail.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is public, which may expose the owner's address to the public, violating privacy concerns and potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks.
