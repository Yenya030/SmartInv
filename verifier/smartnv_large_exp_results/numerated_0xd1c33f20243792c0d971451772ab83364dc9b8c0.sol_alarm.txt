The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any access control mechanism for the functions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to interact with the contract.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle situations where the gas provided may be insufficient for certain operations, leading to potential transaction failures.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are mathematical operations being performed without adequate checks for overflow/underflow, which can result in unexpected behavior.
