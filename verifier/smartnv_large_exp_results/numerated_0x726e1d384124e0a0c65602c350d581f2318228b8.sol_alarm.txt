The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to unintentional access or manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in multiple functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might require a large amount of gas if the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` evaluates to true, potentially leading to out of gas errors.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate` function.
5) Incomplete validation: The `liquidate` function lacks proper validation for input parameters and conditions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
