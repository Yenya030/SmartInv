The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList`, but `startingBlance` is not correctly updated, leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not define the required functions, such as `transfer`. This could lead to incorrect visibility and ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is twice the total token supply, which could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially reach the gas limit, causing the function to fail.
