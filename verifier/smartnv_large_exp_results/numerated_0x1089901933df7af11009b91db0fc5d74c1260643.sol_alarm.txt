The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security risks.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update the state variables in certain functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities.

3) Atomicity violation: There are operations in the contract that are not atomic, such as the multiple state variable updates in the startExecute function, which can lead to vulnerabilities.

4) Insufficient gas: There is a potential risk of running out of gas during the execution of certain functions, which can result in incomplete or failed transactions.

5) Business logic flaw: The logic in the contract may have vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to manipulate the system in unintended ways.
