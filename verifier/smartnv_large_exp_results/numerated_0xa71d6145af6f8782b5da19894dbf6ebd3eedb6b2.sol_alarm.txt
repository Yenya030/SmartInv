The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the variable lockedFunds without any indication of what this variable is used for or how it affects the contract state.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute performs a check that involves iteration over all token holders, which could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract you provided are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
