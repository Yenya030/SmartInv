The contract in question contains potential vulnerabilities in the following areas:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as `internal` which might not be the intended visibility.

2) Inconsistent State Update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient Gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract against the total supply without sufficient gas, which could result in an out of gas error.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership
- Inconsistent State Update
- Insufficient Gas
