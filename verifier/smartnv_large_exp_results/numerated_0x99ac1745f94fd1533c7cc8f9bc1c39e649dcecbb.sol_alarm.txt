Potential vulnerabilities in the analyzed contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `withdrawTokens` function does not have a visibility modifier, making it public by default, which could potentially allow unauthorized users to call this function and withdraw tokens. Consider adding an appropriate visibility modifier to restrict access.
2) atomicty violation: The `tokenSupply` is updated directly in the `buyTokens` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to race conditions and inconsistent state updates. Consider implementing appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure atomicity of state updates in a concurrent environment.
