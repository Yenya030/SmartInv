The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute()" updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any further processing or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables "WETH", "USDC", and "pair" in the "ExchangeTokens" contract are declared as public, which may expose sensitive information. It is recommended to use more restrictive visibility for sensitive variables.
