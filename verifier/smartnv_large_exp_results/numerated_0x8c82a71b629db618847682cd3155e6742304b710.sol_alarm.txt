Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation: The contract does not restrict access to certain functions based on role or permission level, potentially allowing unauthorized users to call sensitive functions.
2) inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in the functions without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations on unsigned integers without checking for overflow or underflow, which could result in unexpected values or errors.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of functions and variables, which could lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts or actors.
