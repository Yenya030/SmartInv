The contract to analyze:
contract VotingSystem {
         mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
         mapping(uint => uint) public votes;
         
         function vote(uint proposalId) public {
             require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");
             votes[proposalId]++;
             hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities:
7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of the proposal ID, which could lead to conflicts or inconsistencies in the voting results.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables `hasVoted` and `votes` are publicly accessible, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the voting data.
