Contract you are going to analyze:
contract Auction {
     address public highestBidder;
     uint public highestBid;
     mapping(address => uint) public bids;

     function bid(uint amount) public {
         require(amount > highestBid, "Bid not high enough");
         if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
             address(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid); 
         }
         highestBidder = msg.sender;
         highestBid = amount;
         bids[msg.sender] += amount;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
         require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Cannot withdraw while being the highest bidder");
         uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
         bids[msg.sender] = 0;
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }

     function endAuction() public {
         require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only highest bidder can end auction");
         address(this).transfer(highestBid);
     }
}
