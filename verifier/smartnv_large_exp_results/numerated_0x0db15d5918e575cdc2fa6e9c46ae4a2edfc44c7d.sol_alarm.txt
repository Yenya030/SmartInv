Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any mutex or lock mechanism, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the "votedProposal" function, making it unclear who can access and call this function, which could lead to unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle out-of-gas exceptions, which could result in failed execution of transactions and leave the contract in inconsistent states.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations in the "liquidate" function that involve multiplication and division, which could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow if the values exceed the maximum or minimum integer limits.
