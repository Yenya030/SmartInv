The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without proper validation or synchronization.
2) Price manipulation: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract calculates the price based on token balances, which can be manipulated by attackers to obtain inaccurate values.
