The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without checking if it is already in progress or finalized, which may lead to inconsistent data.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` updates the `proposal` state in multiple steps without proper synchronization, which may result in unexpected behavior if multiple transactions interact with the contract simultaneously.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if the gas limit is reached while executing the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` mapping are declared as internal, which may expose sensitive data to external contracts and potentially lead to unauthorized access.

Overall, the contract may need further validation and improvements to address these vulnerabilities.
