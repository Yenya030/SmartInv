The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract SecureToken {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) No atomicity violation protection in the transfer function.
2) No restriction on who can call the deposit function, which may lead to ether leakage.
3) No check for integer overflow/underflow in the withdraw function.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are atomicity violation, ether leakage, and integer overflow/underflow.
