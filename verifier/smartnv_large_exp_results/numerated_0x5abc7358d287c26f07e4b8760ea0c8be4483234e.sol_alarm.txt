The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanism.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBalanceList` mapping is being accessed without any visibility specifier which can lead to potential access control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks for a condition that involves calculating the sum of `balanceOf` values, which could potentially exceed the gas limit and cause the function to fail.
