The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - In the 'startExecute' function, the 'startingBalanceList' mapping is updated without initializing 'startingBalanceList' in the contract or the 'proposal' struct.
   
2) ID uniqueness violation:
   - There is no mechanism in place to ensure that the 'proposal' ID is unique, which could lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The 'proposal' struct is not specified with a visibility keyword, potentially leading to unexpected accessibility or manipulation of its data.
