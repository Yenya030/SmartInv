The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility for the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security risks.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state updates in the functions may not be consistent due to the lack of proper checks and balances, leading to unexpected behavior.
3) Atomicity violation: The functions lack proper synchronization mechanisms, which can result in race conditions and atomicity violations.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution, leading to failed transactions or vulnerable states.
