The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not maintain consistent state updates when executing proposals. The `execute` function does not properly handle updating the `votedAmount` field of the `Proposal` struct.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and `votingToken` are defined as internal, which may lead to incorrect visibility and ownership control. 

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas due to potentially large balances, risking failure in execution.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
