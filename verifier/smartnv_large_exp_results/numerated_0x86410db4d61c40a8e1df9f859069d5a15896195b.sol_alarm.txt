The contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data.
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply())` condition is not met, causing the function to fail.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which may lead to visibility and ownership issues.
