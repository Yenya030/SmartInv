This contract may contain the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract's execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct directly, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function requires checking if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total supply of the voting token. This check could consume excessive gas if the contract holds a large balance, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of some variables and functions in the contract is not explicitly defined. It's important to ensure that the visibility is correctly set to prevent unintended access or modification by external parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
