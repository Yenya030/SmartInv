The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The `calculatePrice` function in the contract `ExchangeTokens` may have a business logic flaw as it calculates the price based on the balance of tokens in the Uniswap pair, which may not always accurately reflect the market price.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract is set to public, which may expose sensitive price calculation information to all external parties.

3) Inconsistent state update: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract updates the `debt` and `collateral` mappings based on a condition without considering potential reentrancy issues that could lead to inconsistent state updates. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, incorrect visibility/ownership, and inconsistent state update.
