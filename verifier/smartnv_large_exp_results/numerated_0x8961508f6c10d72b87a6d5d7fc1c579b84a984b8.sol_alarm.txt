The contract you provided for analysis contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
   - In the function `liquidate`, the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` may result in integer overflow if the values are not properly constrained.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The visibility of the `calculatePrice` function is set to public, which may expose sensitive pricing information to external parties. Consider making it internal or private depending on the intended use case. 

3) Ether leakage:
   - There is a lack of handling potential ether transfers in the contract, which could result in ether leakage if not managed properly.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are integer overflow/underflow, incorrect visibility/ownership, and ether leakage.
