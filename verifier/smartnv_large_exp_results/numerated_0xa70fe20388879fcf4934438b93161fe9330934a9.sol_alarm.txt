Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the variable "proposal" to store the state of a proposal, but it doesn't properly reset the state after each proposal is executed or ended. This could lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions in the contract are declared as external, which means they can only be called from outside the contract. This could be intentional, but if the intended use case is to call these functions internally, then the visibility should be changed to internal.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include any mechanisms to handle situations where the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of functions. This could potentially result in failed transaction execution if the gas limit is too low.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses the address of the proposal creator as an identifier for proposals. If multiple users have the same address, it could lead to ID uniqueness violations and conflicts when interacting with the proposals.
5) Business logic flaw: The logic for checking if a proposal is ongoing or has ended may be flawed, as it relies solely on the sTime value without considering other factors. This could result in incorrect execution or ending of proposals.
