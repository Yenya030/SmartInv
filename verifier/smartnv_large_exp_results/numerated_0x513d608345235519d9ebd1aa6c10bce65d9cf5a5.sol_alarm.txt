The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute()` function based on the balance of the voting token held by the contract. However, the balance check condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` seems flawed and may lead to an inconsistent state update.

Therefore, the potential vulnerability in the contract is inconsistent state update.
