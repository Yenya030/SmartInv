The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Consistent state update - in function `endExecute`, it is possible that the balance calculation may not be accurate due to the use of `lockedFunds` without further processing.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - the visibility of variables `lockedFunds` and `startingBalanceList` is not specified, which may lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
3) Business logic flaw - in function `endExecute`, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` may not accurately determine the execution status.
