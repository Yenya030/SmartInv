Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: In the startExecute function, the startingBalanceList is being updated with the starting balance of the proposal's address without proper validation.
2) Atomicity violation: In the execute function, the transfer of tokens and incrementing of votedAmount are not done atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition where the balance of the contract must be more than twice the total supply of votingToken. This might require a significant amount of gas to execute, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the proposal struct is not specified, which could lead to potential data leakage or unauthorized access.
5) Privilege escalation: The access control mechanism for functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute is not implemented, potentially allowing unauthorized users to execute these functions.
