The potential vulnerabilities in the contract to be analyzed are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state of the proposal by incrementing the votedAmount without any check on the current state of the proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal visibility of the owner variable could potentially lead to ownership-related vulnerabilities if not managed properly within the contract. 

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may require a significant amount of gas depending on the size of the votingToken balances, which could lead to out-of-gas errors if the gas limit is not set appropriately. 

4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The transferFrom function calls in the execute() and endExecute() functions could potentially lead to inconsistencies between the contract's balances and external token balances if not properly handled.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and cross bridge inconsistency.
