The contract for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Auction {
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function placeBid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
            bids[highestBidder] += highestBid;
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawBid() public {
        require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Cannot withdraw highest bid");
        uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the Auction contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update
2) Reentrancy
