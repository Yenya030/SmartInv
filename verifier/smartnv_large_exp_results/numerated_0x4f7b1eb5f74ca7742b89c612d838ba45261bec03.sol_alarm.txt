The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBalanceList` mapping without initializing it.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is used without any visibility specifier, making it publicly accessible.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to running out of gas while looping through all the balances in the `votingToken`.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
