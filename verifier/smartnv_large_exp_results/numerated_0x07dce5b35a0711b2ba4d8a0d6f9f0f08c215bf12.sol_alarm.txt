The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'endExecute' function updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without any proper synchronization mechanism, possibly leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct and 'votingToken' variable are used without specifying their visibility level which could lead to ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract is handling a large number of tokens, the gas limit set for transactions may be insufficient causing transactions to fail.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
