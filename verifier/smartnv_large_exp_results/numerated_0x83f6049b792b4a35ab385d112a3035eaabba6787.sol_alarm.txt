The contract provided for analysis is:

contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(uint _amount) public {
        votes[msg.sender] += _amount;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address _newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
        admin = _newAdmin;
    }

    function getTotalVotes() public view returns(uint) {
        uint total = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < votes.length; i++) {
            total += votes[i];
        }
        return total;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function changeAdmin allows the admin address to be changed, but there is no check to ensure that the new admin address is a valid or secure address.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, making it accessible to anyone to see who the admin is, which may not be desirable for security reasons.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The mapping votes uses the address type as keys, which might not ensure unique identification and could lead to potential conflicts or unexpected behavior.

Overall, this contract contains vulnerabilities that could be exploited if not addressed properly.
