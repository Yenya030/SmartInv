The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    uint public totalTokens;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = 100;
        totalTokens = 1000;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint tokensToBuy) public payable {
        require(msg.value == tokensToBuy * tokenPrice, "Incorrect payment amount");
        totalTokens -= tokensToBuy; 
        msg.sender.transfer(msg.value);
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Atomicity violation - The `totalTokens -= tokensToBuy;` operation is not atomic which means that it is possible for an external account to call `buyTokens` multiple times in quick succession and potentially result in an inconsistency in the `totalTokens` count.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The `owner` variable should be made private and there should be a function to explicitly allow changing the owner. Otherwise, the ownership can be manipulated by external accounts.
3) Inconsistent state update - The `totalTokens` count is not updated atomically with the transfer of tokens, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
4) Insufficient gas - If the contract balance exceeds the gas limit, the `withdrawFunds` function can fail and result in locked funds in the contract.
5) Ether leakage - The contract transfers Ether back to the buyer without ensuring that the transfer is successful, which might lead to Ether getting stuck in the contract and leakage of funds.
6) Business logic flaw - The calculation of the amount of tokens to buy solely based on the payment amount without taking into account the current token price might lead to unexpected results or exploits.
