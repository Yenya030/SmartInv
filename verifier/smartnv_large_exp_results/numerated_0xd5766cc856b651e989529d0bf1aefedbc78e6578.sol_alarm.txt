The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "withdrawTokens()" function should have more strict access control as it currently allows any address to withdraw all tokens from the contract.
2) Arithmetic flaw: In the "buyTokens()" function, multiplying the input amount by 1000 might lead to integer overflow if the input amount is large, resulting in incorrect token calculation.
