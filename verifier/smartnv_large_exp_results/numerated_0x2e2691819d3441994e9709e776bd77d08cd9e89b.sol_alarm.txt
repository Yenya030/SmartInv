<\potential_vulnerabilities\>
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'setPrice' function should only be accessed by the admin, but the modifier to enforce this condition is missing, making it vulnerable to privilege escalation.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in the 'buyTokens' function could result in an integer overflow if the multiplication of '_amount' and 'price' exceeds the maximum uint value.
3) Insufficient gas: If the 'buyTokens' function requires a large amount of gas to execute due to high '_amount' inputs, it may result in an out of gas error, making it vulnerable to insufficient gas.
4) Atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the 'buyTokens' function as the transfer of tokens and the increment of 'tokensSold' are not done atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
