The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Insufficient gas: The function calculatePrice() may fail if it requires more gas than the provided gas limit.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation by external entities.
