The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function may allow for an incorrect liquidation calculation due to the condition in the require statement.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The debt and collateral mappings are public, potentially exposing sensitive information.
