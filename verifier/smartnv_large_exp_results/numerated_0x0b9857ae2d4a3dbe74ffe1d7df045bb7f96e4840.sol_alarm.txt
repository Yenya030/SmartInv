Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if there are existing proposals, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may fail due to insufficient gas if the execution fails, causing unexpected behavior.
