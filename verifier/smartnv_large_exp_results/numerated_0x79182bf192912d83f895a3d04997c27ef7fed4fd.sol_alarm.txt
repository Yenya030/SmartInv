Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the voter has actually voted, which can lead to incorrect state changes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined with any visibility specifier, which can lead to potential visibility-related issues.
