The contract to analyze:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint vote;
    }

    struct Proposal {
        address proposer;
        uint votes;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    Proposal[] public proposals;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation");
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;

        Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];
        if (delegateTo.voted) {
            proposals[delegateTo.vote].votes += sender.weight;
        } else {
            delegateTo.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint proposalIndex) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = proposalIndex;
        proposals[proposalIndex].votes += sender.weight;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract above are:
- Insufficient gas: It may run out of gas during delegate function execution.
- Business logic flaw: There could be a flaw in the logic for delegate and vote functions.
- ID uniqueness violation: There might be an issue with ensuring unique IDs for voters or proposals.
