The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the insurance contract is solely based on the `owner` variable, which can easily be manipulated if there is a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to change the `owner` variable.

2) Ether leakage: There is a possibility of Ether leakage in the `claimInsurance` function if the transfer of funds to `msg.sender` fails, leaving the `insuranceAmount` variable non-zero without having any method to withdraw it.

3) Insufficient gas: If the amount of gas provided for the transaction is not enough for the transfer in the `claimInsurance` function, the function may fail to execute successfully.
