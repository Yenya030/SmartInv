Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated within the same function (proposal.votedAmount and lockedFunds in functions execute() and endExecute() respectively). This can lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface, but it is not clear if the required functions are implemented correctly. Visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not specified, which can lead to access control issues.
3) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities related to handling of ether.
