The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without ensuring that all conditions for a successful execution have been met, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate` function of the `ExchangeTokens` contract, there is an arithmetic flaw where the calculation of whether a user's fund can be liquidated might be incorrect due to the calculation involving multiplication and division without proper handling of potential overflow/underflow issues.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `ExchangeTokens` contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of its state variables, leaving them as public which may expose sensitive information to external parties.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are inconsistent state update, arithmetic flaw, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
