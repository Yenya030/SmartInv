The contract being analyzed:

contract VotingContract {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;

    function vote(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        votes[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawVotes() public {
        uint amount = votes[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No votes to withdraw");
        votes[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the VotingContract are:
1) integer overflow/underflow
2) insufficient gas
