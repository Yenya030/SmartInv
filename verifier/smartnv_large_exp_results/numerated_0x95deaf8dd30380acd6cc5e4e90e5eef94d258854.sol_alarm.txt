Contract to be analyzed:

contract Escrow {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public funds;
  
    constructor(address _seller, address _buyer, address _arbiter) public {
        seller = _seller;
        buyer = _buyer;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
    }

    function depositFunds() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit funds");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Funds should be greater than 0");
        funds += msg.value;
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
        require(funds > 0, "No funds to release");
        
        seller.transfer(funds);
        funds = 0;
    }

    function refundFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund funds");
        
        buyer.transfer(funds);
        funds = 0;
    }
}

Output:
Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseFunds() and refundFunds() functions can be called by anyone, not just the arbiter, leading to unauthorized fund release or refund.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify any gas limit which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.
- ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks for unique IDs for seller, buyer, and arbiter, which could lead to unauthorized access if these addresses are manipulated.
