The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without resetting the `proposal` struct, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` performs multiple state changes without using proper locking mechanisms, which may result in inconsistent data if multiple transactions interfere.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not define the required functions, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or compilation errors.
