The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract UserWallet {
    mapping(uint => uint) public balances;
    uint public totalBalance;

    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        totalBalance += amount;
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        totalBalance -= amount;
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update: The totalBalance is updated before the individual user balance is updated in the deposit function, which could lead to inconsistency if there is an error during the individual user balance update.
- Integer overflow/underflow: If the totalBalance or individual user balance exceeds the maximum value of a uint, it could result in an integer overflow.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, which makes all balances visible to anyone, potentially exposing sensitive information.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities identified in the UserWallet contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
