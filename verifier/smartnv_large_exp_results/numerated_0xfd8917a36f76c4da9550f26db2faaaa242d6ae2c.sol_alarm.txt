The contract you provided is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint vote;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    mapping(uint => uint) public voteCount;
    
    function delegate(address to) public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted.");
        
        voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;
    }
    
    function vote(uint proposal) public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted.");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = proposal;
        
        voteCount[proposal]++;
    }
    
    function getWinner() public view returns (uint winningProposal) {
        uint winningVoteCount = 0;
        
        for (uint p = 0; p < 10; p++) {
            if (voteCount[p] > winningVoteCount) {
                winningVoteCount = voteCount[p];
                winningProposal = p;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure that a voter's address is unique, which could lead to issues with multiple votes or voting conflicts.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `voteCount` mapping is public, exposing the voting results to everyone, potentially compromising the integrity of the voting process.
- Business logic flaw: The `getWinner` function is hardcoded to iterate over 10 proposals, which may not accurately reflect the actual number of proposals in the system, leading to incorrect results.
