Based on the contract provided, the potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function 'endExecute' updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without resetting the 'proposal' state, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contracts do not specify the appropriate visibility (public, internal, private) for variables like 'owner', 'votingToken', 'proposal', 'startingBalanceList', and 'lockedFunds', which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of data. Additionally, ownership control mechanisms are not implemented explicitly.

3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas required for executing transactions, which may result in functions failing due to insufficient gas provided by the user.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
