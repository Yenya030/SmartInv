The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without ensuring atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are trying to update the same proposal simultaneously.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the `endExecute` function when checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`. If the balance of the contract and total supply are large enough, this calculation could result in an overflow.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially run out of gas if the balance of the contract and total supply are large, causing the function to fail.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which could lead to potential visibility issues or unintended access to the ownership of the contract. It is important to explicitly define the visibility of variables to ensure proper access control.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update, Integer overflow/underflow, Insufficient gas, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
