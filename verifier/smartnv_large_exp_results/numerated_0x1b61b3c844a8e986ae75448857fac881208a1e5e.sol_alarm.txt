Contract: 

contract Auction {
     address public highestBidder;
     uint public highestBid;
     mapping(address => uint) public pendingReturns;

     function bid() public payable {
         require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid not high enough");
         if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
             pendingReturns[highestBidder] += highestBid;
         }
         highestBidder = msg.sender;
         highestBid = msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
         uint amount = pendingReturns[msg.sender];
         pendingReturns[msg.sender] = 0;
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The bid function doesn't have protection against integer overflow/underflow when calculating the highestBid.
2) Insufficient gas: The withdraw function transfers funds to the user, which could run out of gas and prevent the transfer from completing.
3) Inconsistent state update: The bid function updates the highestBidder and highestBid variables before updating the pendingReturns mapping, which could lead to inconsistent state if an error occurs during the pendingReturns update.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The pendingReturns mapping is set to public, which exposes user balances publicly and may not be intended for public access.
