Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin address should be properly secured to prevent unauthorized access to the refund function.
2) Inconsistent state update: Changing the state of payments[_invoiceId] before transferring the amount to the merchant can lead to inconsistencies if an exception occurs during the transfer.
3) Insufficient gas: The refund function may fail if the gas provided is not enough to complete the transaction, potentially locking the funds.
4) Atomicity violation: The payment and state update should ideally be done atomically to avoid issues if the contract halts midway through the process.
