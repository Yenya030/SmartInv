The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 
 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute. It is important to clearly define the visibility of functions, especially when dealing with sensitive operations.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the function startExecute, the startingBlance variable is misspelled and may result in inconsistent state update issues if not corrected.
3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to potential conflicts and errors in tracking proposals.
4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions securely, potentially leading to ether leakage if not handled properly.
5) Privilege escalation: The contract declares the owner variable but does not utilize it in access control mechanisms, which can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
