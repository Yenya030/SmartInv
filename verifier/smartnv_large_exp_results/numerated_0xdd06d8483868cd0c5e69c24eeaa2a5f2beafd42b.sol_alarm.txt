Contract to analyze:
```
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public voteCount;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        voteCount[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function withdrawVote() public {
        require(voteCount[msg.sender] > 0, "You have no votes to withdraw");
        voteCount[msg.sender]--;
        totalVotes--;
    }

    function getVotes(address user) public view returns (uint) {
        return voteCount[user];
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation
2) Inconsistent state update
