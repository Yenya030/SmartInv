The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to see who the admin is, potentially compromising security.
- privilege escalation: The giveRightToVote function allows the admin to give the right to vote to any address, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- inconsistent state update: In the delegate function, there is a loop to check for delegation loops that could result in inconsistent state updates.
- ID uniqueness violation: The implementation of delegate does not guarantee unique IDs, which can lead to issues with delegate delegation.
