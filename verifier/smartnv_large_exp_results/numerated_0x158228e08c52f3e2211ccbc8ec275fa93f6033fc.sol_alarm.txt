Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal without ensuring atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to potential privilege escalation attacks if not managed properly.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow/underflow in the liquidate function, especially in the calculation for liquidation eligibility.
