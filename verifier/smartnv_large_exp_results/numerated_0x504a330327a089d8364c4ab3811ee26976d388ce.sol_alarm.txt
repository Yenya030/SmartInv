Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, and the visibility of certain functions may not be appropriate.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the state variables without using a proper locking mechanism, which may lead to inconsistencies.
3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may require a large amount of gas to execute, which could result in a failed transaction.
4) Atomicity violation: Operations in the "execute" function are not atomic, which could potentially lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior.
