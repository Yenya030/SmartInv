Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without correctly checking if the execution was successful or not, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The calculations and operations within the `endExecute` function (e.g., checking balance, transferring tokens) may require more gas than available in certain scenarios, leading to failed executions.
