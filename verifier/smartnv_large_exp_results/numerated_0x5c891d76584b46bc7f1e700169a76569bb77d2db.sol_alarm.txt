The contract provided below contains potential vulnerabilities as listed in the analysis of the code. 

contract Storage {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Output:
1) privilege escalation
2) atomicity violation
