The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains multiple state variables such as `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` that are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent data state.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract allows for the overwriting of `proposal` struct without any checks for ID uniqueness, which can lead to unexpected behavior or data corruption.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables `owner` and `votingToken`, potentially exposing them to unauthorized access or manipulation.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may fail if the gas provided is not enough to complete the required operations, leading to unexpected behavior or failed execution.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow, such as in the calculation of `startExecute()` and `liquidate()` functions.

6) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not include any precautionary measures to prevent potential self-destruct functions, which can lead to irreversible loss of contract and funds.
