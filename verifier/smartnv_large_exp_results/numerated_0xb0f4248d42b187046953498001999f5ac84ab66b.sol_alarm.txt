The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are as follows: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.

2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` and `execute` functions, there are state variables being updated without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a significant amount of gas if there are a large number of token holders, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state updates, and insufficient gas.
