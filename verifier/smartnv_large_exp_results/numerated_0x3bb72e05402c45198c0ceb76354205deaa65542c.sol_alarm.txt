The contract below contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract does not explicitly define visibility and ownership for functions and variables, which could lead to unexpected access or manipulation by unauthorized users.

2) Inconsistent state update:
- The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a condition that may not correspond to the actual state of the contract, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the stored data.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The `endExecute` function contains a gas-intensive operation (`votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`), which may require more gas than available in standard transactions, leading to execution failures.

4) Business logic flaw:
- The `endExecute` function enforces a condition that may not accurately reflect the successful execution of the proposal, potentially allowing for unintended outcomes or vulnerabilities in the contract's logic.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Business logic flaw
