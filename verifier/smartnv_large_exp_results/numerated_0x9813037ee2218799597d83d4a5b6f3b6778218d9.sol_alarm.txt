Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using the safe math library, which can lead to inconsistent state updates due to integer overflow/underflow.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially fail if the gas provided is not enough to execute the required operations, leading to incomplete execution and potential vulnerabilities.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not specified with any visibility keyword, making it publicly accessible. This lack of proper visibility control can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposal data.
