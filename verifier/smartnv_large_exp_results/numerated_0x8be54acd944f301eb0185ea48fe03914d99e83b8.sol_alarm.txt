The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable proposal without checking if there is an ongoing proposal or if the caller has the privilege to do so.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The internal state variable owner is not being used or properly managed in the contract, potentially leading to ownership and access control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function may run out of gas if the condition require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply() is not properly optimized or if the gas limit is exceeded.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks implemented to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior in the contract.
