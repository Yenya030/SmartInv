The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute()` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a condition that checks the balance of `votingToken` in the contract, which can potentially lead to an inconsistent state if the balance changes before the function completes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as public, which exposes it to external manipulation and potentially incorrect access. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
