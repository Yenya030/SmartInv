Contract to analyze:

contract PaymentContract {
    mapping(uint => address) public payments;
    uint public totalPayments;

    function makePayment(address _recipient, uint _amount) public {
        require(_amount > 0, "Payment amount must be greater than 0");
        _recipient.transfer(_amount);
        payments[totalPayments] = _recipient;
        totalPayments++;
    }
}
Output: 
1) reentrancy
