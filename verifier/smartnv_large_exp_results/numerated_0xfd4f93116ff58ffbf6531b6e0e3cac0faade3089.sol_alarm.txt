- Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent data.
- Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may require a large amount of gas if the condition in the require statement is not met, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the state variable owner is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or modification by external contracts.
