Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) ID uniqueness violation - The contract does not seem to have any mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not properly defined, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical data.
