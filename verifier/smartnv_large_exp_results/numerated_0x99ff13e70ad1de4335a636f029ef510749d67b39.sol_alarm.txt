Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to specific users or roles, leaving it vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks.
- Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistency in the contract state.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain functions and variables is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation by external parties.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle gas limitations appropriately, which could result in transaction failures or unexpected behavior due to insufficient gas provided.
