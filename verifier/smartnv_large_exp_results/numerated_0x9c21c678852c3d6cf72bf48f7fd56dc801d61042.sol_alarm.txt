The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable is updated in the 'endExecute' function, but there is no indication that this update is part of a single atomic operation. This could lead to inconsistent state if other functions rely on the 'lockedFunds' variable before or after it is updated.

2) Insufficient gas: The 'startExecute' and 'endExecute' functions do not specify the gas needed for their execution. This could lead to a situation where the functions fail due to running out of gas, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
