The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility modifiers for its functions, which can lead to potential security risks.

2) Insufficient gas: The execute function in the contract may require a significant amount of gas to execute due to the transferFrom operation, which can potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

3) Inconsistent state update: In the endExecute function, the condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")" updates the lockedFunds variable based on the balance of the contract, which may not accurately reflect the total supply of the token in case of external interactions.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce unique IDs for proposals, which can lead to potential conflicts or unauthorized access.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions carefully, which can lead to potential Ether leakage or loss.

6) Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate function in the contract uses a mathematical expression that involves multiplication and division, which can lead to potential arithmetic errors or vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- Inconsistent state update
- ID uniqueness violation
- Ether leakage
- Arithmetic flaw
