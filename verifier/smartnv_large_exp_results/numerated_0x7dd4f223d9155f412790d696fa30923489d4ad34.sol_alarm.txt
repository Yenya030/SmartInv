The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   In the `endExecute` function, the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` may lead to an inconsistent state update if the balance changes during the execution.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   The access modifiers for the variables `startingBalanceList` and `lockedFunds` are not specified, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.

3) Insufficient gas:
   The `execute` function calls `votingToken.transferFrom` without specifying the amount of gas to be sent, which could result in insufficient gas for the transaction to be completed successfully.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
