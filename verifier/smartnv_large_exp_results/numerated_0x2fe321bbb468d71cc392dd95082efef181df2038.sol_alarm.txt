The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;
    
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    function swapTokens(uint amountA, uint amountB) public {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountA, "Insufficient balance of tokenA");
        require(tokenB.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountB, "Insufficient balance of tokenB");
        
        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);
        
        balances[msg.sender] += amountA;
        balances[msg.sender] += amountB;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract TokenSwap are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The line `balances[msg.sender] += amountB;` is updating the balance incorrectly by adding `amountB` to the balance twice instead of updating it with `amountA`.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The public visibility of the `balances` mapping can expose sensitive information about users' token balances to anyone. It might be preferable to make this mapping private or internal to avoid potential privacy concerns.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
