Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Reentrancy: On line 7, the transfer function could lead to a reentrancy vulnerability if the recipient contract's fallback function performs unexpected operations.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update since the highestBidder and highestBid are updated before transferring the funds, which could lead to unexpected results if the transfer fails.
