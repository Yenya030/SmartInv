Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculatePrice function in the contract might encounter an integer overflow if the balance of USDC or WETH exceeds the maximum value that uint can hold.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the debt and collateral mappings is public, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
3) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function may have a flaw in its logic as it currently only checks if 80% of the collateral amount is less than the debt amount for liquidation, which could potentially lead to incorrect outcomes.
