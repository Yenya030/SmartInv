Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without limiting the times it can be called, which may lead to unexpected results if called multiple times.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are public, which can expose sensitive information to external parties and potentially lead to unauthorized access to these data.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
