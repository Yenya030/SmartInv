Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The function execute in the TimelockController contract updates the votedAmount field of the proposal struct directly, which could lead to inconsistent state if not properly handled.
2) business logic flaw: In the ExchangeTokens contract, the liquidate function uses a calculation involving the getPrice() function without constraints or validations, which could potentially lead to a business logic flaw.
3) integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow or underflow in the liquidate function of the ExchangeTokens contract when calculating the debt amount compared to the collateral amount.
