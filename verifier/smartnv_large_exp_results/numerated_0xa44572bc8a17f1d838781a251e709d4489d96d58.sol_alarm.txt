Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - The onlyOwner modifier is not defined in the contract, which could lead to unauthorized access to the withdrawTokens function.
2) inconsistency in state update - The balance check in the buyTokens function should deduct the transferred amount from the contract's balance.
3) insufficient gas - The buyTokens function does not specify gas limitations which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) atomicity violation - Multiple external calls in the buyTokens function may not be executed atomically, leading to potential reentrancy vulnerabilities.
