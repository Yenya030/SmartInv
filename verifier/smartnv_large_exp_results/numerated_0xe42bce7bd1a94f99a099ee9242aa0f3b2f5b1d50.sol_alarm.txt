Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation - The contract does not enforce uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in the system.
2) Inconsistent state update - The proposal's `votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, leading to potential race conditions or incorrect data.
3) Atomicity violation - The `execute` function does not ensure atomicity of the transfer and update operations, which may result in inconsistent state if the operations fail midway.
4) Insufficient gas - The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas exceptions, which could result in failed transactions and interrupted processes.
