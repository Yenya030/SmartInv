The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: 
   - In the function endExecute(), the expression votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 could potentially cause an integer overflow if the value exceeds the maximum limit for uint256.

2) Insufficient gas:
   - There is a risk of running out of gas in the function execute() if the loop for transferring tokens to the contract consumes too much gas, resulting in the transaction failing.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide the necessary functions like transfer(), transferFrom(), approve(), etc., which might lead to incorrect ownership or visibility issues.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the provided contract are integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
