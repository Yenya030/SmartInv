The potential vulnerabilities in the "TokenSwap" contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The tokens are transferred before the corresponding tokens are received in the function "swapTokens". This could lead to an inconsistent state if the transfer fails halfway.
2) Atomicity violation: The swapping of tokens is not done atomically, which could lead to a situation where one token is transferred but the other is not, leaving the contract and the user in an undesired state.
