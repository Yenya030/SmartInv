The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `proposal` struct is updated directly in the `execute` function without any check for reentrancy or race conditions.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and other variables are not specified with any access control visibility (e.g., public, internal, private), leaving them potentially accessible from outside the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may consume a large amount of gas if there are a high number of token holders due to the check `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply())`, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
