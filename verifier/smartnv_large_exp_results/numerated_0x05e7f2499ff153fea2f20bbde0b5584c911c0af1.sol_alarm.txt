The potential vulnerabilities in the above contract are:
1) inconsistent state update: The "startExecute" function updates the proposal state without checking if the sender has the necessary privileges to do so.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is marked as internal, which may introduce issues related to ownership and visibility control.
