Contract TimelockController:
1) Inconsistent state update: The startingBalanceList mapping is being updated in the startExecute function without first initializing the proposal struct, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility. It should be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.

Contract ExchangeTokens:
1) Price manipulation: The liquidate function calculates the amount based on a price returned by the getPrice function, which could potentially be manipulated or inaccurate, leading to incorrect liquidation amounts being processed.
