Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() sets the proposal without checking if there is already an ongoing proposal, leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the IERC20 interface but does not actually implement its functions, which can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership.
3) Insufficient gas: The execute function might require a significant amount of gas to execute due to potential loops or complex operations, leading to insufficient gas error.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
