The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) reentrancy: The contract might be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, especially in the liquidate function where external calls are made to transfer funds.
2) arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function may pose an arithmetic flaw as it directly divides the balance of tokens without considering potential division by zero errors or precision issues. 

These are the potential vulnerabilities found in the contract.
