The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: There is a state update in the "execute" function through the line "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" without using proper synchronization methods, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract declares to implement the IERC20 interface but does not have any implementation of the required functions, such as transfer, transferFrom, etc., which could result in incorrect behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
