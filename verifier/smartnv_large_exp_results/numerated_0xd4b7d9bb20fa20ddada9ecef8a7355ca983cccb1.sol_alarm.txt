Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:  
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without checking if there is an ongoing proposal, potentially allowing for conflicting states.  
2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail to execute completely if the gas provided is insufficient, which can lead to locked funds and potential issues.
