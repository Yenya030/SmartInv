The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) ID uniqueness violation - the contract relies on the uniqueness of addresses as identifiers for voters, which can potentially lead to issues if there are address collisions or manipulations.
2) Inconsistent state update - there is a risk of inconsistent state updates between the totalVotes counter and the hasVoted mapping, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership - the lack of access control mechanisms or visibility modifiers can expose the contract to unauthorized access or manipulation of the totalVotes and hasVoted variables.
