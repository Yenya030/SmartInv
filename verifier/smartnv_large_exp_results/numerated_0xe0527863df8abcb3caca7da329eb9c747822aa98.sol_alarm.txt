The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSale {
     address public owner;
     IERC20 public token;
     uint public tokenPrice;
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;

     constructor(address _tokenAddress, uint _price) {
         owner = msg.sender;
         token = IERC20(_tokenAddress);
         tokenPrice = _price;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
         require(msg.value == _amount * tokenPrice, "Incorrect payment amount");
         uint tokensToTransfer = _amount;
         token.transfer(msg.sender, tokensToTransfer);
         balances[msg.sender] += _amount;
     }
}

Output: 
The contract contains potential vulnerabilities of:
- Inconsistent state update: The balances of addresses are directly updated without considering potential reentrancy attacks.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, potentially exposing sensitive information. 
- Insufficient gas: The buyTokens function does not specify gas limits, which can lead to out-of-gas issues.
