Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks a mechanism to ensure uniqueness when assigning IDs to proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated directly in the `execute` function without proper validation or synchronization.
3) Atomicity violation: The functions `execute` and `endExecute` lack atomicity guarantees when interacting with the `votingToken` contract.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not seem to properly define visibility for certain variables and functions, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.
