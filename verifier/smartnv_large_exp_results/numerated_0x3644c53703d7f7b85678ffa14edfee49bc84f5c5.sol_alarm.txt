The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, which may not accurately reflect the locked funds as intended.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There might be potential integer underflow in the `liquidate` function when calculating `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` if `cAmount` is larger than `dAmount`, resulting in an underflow.

3) Insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice` function may consume a lot of gas if the balance of `USDC` and `WETH` becomes large, potentially leading to gas exhaustion issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and insufficient gas.
