Potential Vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function in the `TimelockController` contract updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using a proper synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `debt` and `collateral` mapping in the `ExchangeTokens` contract are public, potentially exposing sensitive information to external parties.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function in the `TimelockController` contract updates the `lockedFunds` variable without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
