Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without performing proper validation checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Arithmetic flaw: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract contains a potentially incorrect arithmetic calculation when checking if a user's fund can be liquidated, which could lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities related to the calculation.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ExchangeTokens contract does not specify the visibility of the calculatePrice function, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities related to external access control.
