Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The state variables `lockedFunds` and `proposal` are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization or checks, leading to potential inconsistency in the contract state.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the necessary functions to comply with the interface, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
