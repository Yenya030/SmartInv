Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract allows anyone to call the execute function and potentially manipulate the execution of proposals.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state of the proposal without checking for reentrancy or ensuring atomicity. This could lead to unpredictable behavior.
3) Ether leakage: The endExecute function does not handle ether transfers securely, which could result in ether being leaked or locked in the contract.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not clearly define the visibility of certain variables and functions, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of contract state.
