The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities: 

<\contract\> 
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public escrowAmount;

    constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter) public {
        buyer = msg.sender;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can deposit");
        escrowAmount += msg.value;
    }

    function releaseAmount() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "Only buyer or seller can release amount");
        require(msg.sender != arbiter, "Arbiter cannot release amount");
        uint amount = escrowAmount;
        escrowAmount = 0;
        (bool success, ) = seller.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }

    function refundAmount() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "Only buyer or seller can refund amount");
        uint amount = escrowAmount;
        escrowAmount = 0;
        (bool success, ) = buyer.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
<\contract\> 

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions releaseAmount() and refundAmount() do not explicitly define the visibility (public, external, etc.), making them potentially vulnerable to incorrect access control.
2) Ledger inconsistency: The escrowAmount variable is directly modified without adequate safeguards, making it vulnerable to inconsistent state updates or potential manipulation.
