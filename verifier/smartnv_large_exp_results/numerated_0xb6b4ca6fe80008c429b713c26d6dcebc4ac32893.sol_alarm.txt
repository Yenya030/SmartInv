Contract: 

contract Auction {
    mapping(address => uint) public bids;
    address highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;
    
    function placeBid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid not high enough");
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            bids[highestBidder] += highestBid;
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdrawBid() public {
        require(msg.sender != highestBidder, "Cannot withdraw highest bid");
        uint amount = bids[msg.sender];
        bids[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Reentrancy - The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks in the withdrawBid function where the transfer is done before updating the bids mapping.
2) Inconsistent state update - In the placeBid function, there is a possibility of inconsistent state update as the bids mapping is updated after changing the highestBidder and highestBid variables. 
3) Incorrect visibility - The bids mapping is public, which exposes sensitive information to anyone who can access the contract storage.

Output: 
reentrancy
inconsistent state update
incorrect visibility
