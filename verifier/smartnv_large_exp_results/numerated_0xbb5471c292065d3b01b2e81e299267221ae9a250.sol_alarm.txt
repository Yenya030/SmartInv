The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without further processing, which might lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a lack of proper input validation in the `liquidate()` function of the contract. If not handled correctly, it could result in integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Integer overflow/underflow
