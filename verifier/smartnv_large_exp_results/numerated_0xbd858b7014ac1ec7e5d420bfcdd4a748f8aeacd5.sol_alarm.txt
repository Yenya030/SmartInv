The contract you have provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
        require(address(msg.sender).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance to bid");
        
        address refundAddress = highestBidder;
        uint refundAmount = highestBid;
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
        
        refund(refundAddress, refundAmount);
    }

    function refund(address recipient, uint amount) private {
        payable(recipient).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Insufficient gas
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
