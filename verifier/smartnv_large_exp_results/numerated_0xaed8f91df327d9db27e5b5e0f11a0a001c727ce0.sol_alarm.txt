The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or users, which could lead to confusion or conflicts in the system.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the "proposal" struct is being updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization or validation, which may lead to inconsistent data.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical data.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are potential risks of integer overflow or underflow in calculations involving balances or amounts, which may lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
5) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas stipend or estimation in some functions, which could result in out-of-gas errors or failed transactions.
6) Business logic flaw: The logic for executing proposals and ending execution has some potential flaws that could impact the intended behavior of the contract.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Insufficient gas
- Business logic flaw
