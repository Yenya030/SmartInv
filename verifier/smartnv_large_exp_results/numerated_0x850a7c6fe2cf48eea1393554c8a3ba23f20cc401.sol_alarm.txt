Contract Analysis:

The contract provided in the prompt is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals or transactions, leaving room for potential ID duplication issues.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct is updated directly by adding the `amount` in the `execute` function, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential calculation errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are defined without any explicit visibility specifier, which can lead to unintended issues with access control and ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership.
