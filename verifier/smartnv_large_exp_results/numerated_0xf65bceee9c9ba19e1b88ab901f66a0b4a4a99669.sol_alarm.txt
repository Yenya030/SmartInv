The contract provided for analysis is:

```
contract Vesting {
    uint public totalVested;
    mapping(address => uint) public vestedAmounts;

    function vest(address beneficiary, uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        totalVested += amount;
        vestedAmounts[beneficiary] += amount;
    }

    function revokeVesting(address beneficiary) external {
        require(vestedAmounts[beneficiary] > 0, "No vested amount to revoke");
        totalVested -= vestedAmounts[beneficiary];
        vestedAmounts[beneficiary] = 0;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The `totalVested` variable can potentially overflow if the values continue to increase without limit, leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `totalVested` should be updated atomically with `vestedAmounts` to avoid inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: If the contract operations consume a large amount of gas, it may lead to out-of-gas exceptions and incomplete execution of functions.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `totalVested` variable is public, which may expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties. Consider using internal or private visibility instead.
