The contract presented contains potential vulnerabilities in the following areas:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` state by setting `proposal` to a new `Proposal` struct, but it does not ensure that existing proposals are properly finalized or reset before creating a new one.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` calculates the `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, which may consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to `out-of-gas` errors if the contract balance is too high.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
