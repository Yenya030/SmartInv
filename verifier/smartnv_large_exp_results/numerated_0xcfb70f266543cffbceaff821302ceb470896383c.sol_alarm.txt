Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation:
   - The `startExecute` function allows any address to start a new proposal without proper authorization from the owner.

2) Inconsistent state update:
   - The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` in the proposal without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which can lead to inconsistent state.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The `endExecute` function sets the `lockedFunds` variable without explicitly handling gas limits, which can potentially lead to out of gas issues.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The `owner` variable is internal, which may not be intended and could lead to ownership vulnerabilities.
