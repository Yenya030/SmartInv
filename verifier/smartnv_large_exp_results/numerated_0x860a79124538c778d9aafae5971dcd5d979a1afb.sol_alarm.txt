Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) atomicity violation - The functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() involve multiple state changes without using any locking mechanism to ensure that these operations are performed atomically.
2) inconsistent state update - The execute() function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without ensuring that it is the correct amount based on the transfer operation.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership - The ownership of the contract is not clearly defined, and the visibility of variables and functions could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of contract state.
