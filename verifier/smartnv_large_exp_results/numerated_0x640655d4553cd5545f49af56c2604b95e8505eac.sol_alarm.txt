The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable without ensuring that it is properly synchronized with the other parts of the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function performs multiple state changes without atomicity guarantees, which could lead to unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails midway.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide implementations for all the required functions, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership of certain functions.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
