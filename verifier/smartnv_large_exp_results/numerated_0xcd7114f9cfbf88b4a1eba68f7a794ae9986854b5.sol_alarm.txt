The contract provided for analysis:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    address public constant companyFeeAddress = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890; 
    uint public price;
    bool public release; 
    
    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _price) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        price = _price;
        release = false;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "You are not the buyer");
        require(msg.value == price, "Incorrect amount sent");
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "You are not the seller or arbiter");
        require(!release, "Funds already released");
        payable(buyer).transfer(price);
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "You are not the seller or arbiter");
        require(!release, "Funds already released");
        uint companyFee = price * 5 / 100;
        payable(companyFeeAddress).transfer(companyFee);
        payable(seller).transfer(price - companyFee);
        release = true;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "release" variable is set to true after transferring funds in the "releaseFunds" function, which can lead to funds being released multiple times if the function is called multiple times.

2) Arithmetic flaw: There is a potential arithmetic flaw in calculating the company fee in the "releaseFunds" function by using integer division, which may lead to rounding errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "release" variable is public, allowing anyone to see the state of whether funds have been released or not. This information should be kept private to prevent potential exploits.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Arithmetic flaw
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
