Vulnerabilities found in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function, but it does not include the required logic to handle potential reentrancy issues, making it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but does not fully implement all the required functionality, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
