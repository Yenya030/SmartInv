The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without any synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update it simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total supply of the token, which may consume a large amount of gas and lead to out-of-gas exceptions if the contract holds a substantial amount of tokens.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" and "proposal" variables are not explicitly declared with any visibility specifier, which may lead to unintended visibility or ownership concerns if not set properly.
