The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated directly in the `endExecute` function without appropriate synchronization or checks, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The operations in the `execute` function are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, potentially allowing for partial execution or interleaved operations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` reference is not explicitly defined in the contract, which may lead to ownership or visibility issues.
