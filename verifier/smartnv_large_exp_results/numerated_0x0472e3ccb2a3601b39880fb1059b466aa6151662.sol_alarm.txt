Contract analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can change admin");
        admin = newAdmin;
    }

    function getAdmin() public view returns (address) {
        return admin;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation: The changeAdmin function allows the admin to change the admin address, potentially leading to privilege escalation if not properly secured.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The hasVoted mapping relies on the sender's address as the key, which may lead to ID uniqueness violation if multiple users share the same address.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, which exposes the admin address to everyone, potentially leading to security risks if not intended.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract include privilege escalation, ID uniqueness violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
