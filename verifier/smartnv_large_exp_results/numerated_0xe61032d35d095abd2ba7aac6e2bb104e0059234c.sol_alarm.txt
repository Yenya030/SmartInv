Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the variables and functions, which could lead to unintended access and manipulation.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a calculation in the `liquidate` function that involves multiplication without checking for potential integer overflow or underflow.
3) Business logic flaw: The `liquidate` function has a condition based on a calculation of `getPrice()` that may not accurately represent the actual liquidation requirements, potentially leading to incorrect actions being taken.
