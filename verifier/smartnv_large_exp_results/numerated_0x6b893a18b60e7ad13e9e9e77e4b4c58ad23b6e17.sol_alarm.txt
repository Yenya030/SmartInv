Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not restrict access to certain functions based on user privileges, allowing potential privilege escalation attacks.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are scenarios where the state variables like proposal.votedAmount are updated without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of certain functions or variables, which could potentially lead to unexpected changes in state or behavior.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are calculations involving integers (e.g., proposal.votedAmount) where overflow or underflow conditions are not handled, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
