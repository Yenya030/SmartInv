The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `startingBlance` in the `startExecute` function is misspelled as `startingBalance` when assigning a value to it. This inconsistency may lead to issues in the state of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is being accessed and modified by external functions without any visibility specified. It is important to specify the correct visibility (public, internal, private) to prevent unauthorized access or unintended modifications.
