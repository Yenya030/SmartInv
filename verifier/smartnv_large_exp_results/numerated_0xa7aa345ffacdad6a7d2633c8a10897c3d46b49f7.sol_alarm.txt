The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no indication of how this state change is being managed or utilized elsewhere in the contract. This can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController claims to implement the interface IERC20, but it doesn't define all the required functions. This can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership of functions specified in the interface.
