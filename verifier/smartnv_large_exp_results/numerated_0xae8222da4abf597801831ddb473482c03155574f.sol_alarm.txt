The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any protection against reentrancy, which can lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility: The variables `WETH`, `USDC`, and `pair` in the contract `ExchangeTokens` are declared as public, which exposes them to potential manipulation or unauthorized access. It is recommended to use more restricted visibility modifiers such as private or internal to prevent unintended access.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility.
