The contract in question is: 

contract VestingVault {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public vestingAmounts;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVested;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function createVesting(address beneficiary, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can create vesting");
        vestingAmounts[beneficiary] = amount;
    }

    function releaseVesting(address beneficiary) public {
        require(hasVested[beneficiary] == false, "beneficiary has already vested");
        require(vestingAmounts[beneficiary] > 0, "beneficiary has no vesting amount");

        hasVested[beneficiary] = true;
        // transfer vested amount to beneficiary
    }
}

Output: 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
