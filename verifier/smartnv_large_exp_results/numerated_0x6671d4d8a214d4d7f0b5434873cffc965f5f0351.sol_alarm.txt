Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has a potential vulnerability of inconsistent state update as there are multiple variables being updated within different functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Integer overflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculatePrice function if the result of the calculation exceeds the maximum value that a uint can hold. 
3) Insufficient gas: The liquidate function could potentially run out of gas and fail if the gas limit is reached during the execution due to excessive gas usage or inefficient code.
