The contract provided for analysis:

contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    uint public tokenPrice;
    uint public totalTokens;
    uint public tokensSold;

    mapping(address => uint) public tokenBalance;

    constructor(uint _tokenPrice, uint _totalTokens) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
        totalTokens = _totalTokens;
        tokensSold = 0;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _numTokens) public payable {
        require(tokensSold + _numTokens <= totalTokens, "Not enough tokens left");
        require(msg.value == tokenPrice * _numTokens, "Incorrect payment amount");

        tokenBalance[msg.sender] += _numTokens;
        tokensSold += _numTokens;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the contract owner");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

Output: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract allows anyone to call the `withdraw` function which transfer the contract balance and only checks if the sender is the contract owner after transferring. This could lead to unauthorized withdrawal of funds.
