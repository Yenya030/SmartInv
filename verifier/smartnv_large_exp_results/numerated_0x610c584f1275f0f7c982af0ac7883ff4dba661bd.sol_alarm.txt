The identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function does not reset the `proposal` struct after executing, potentially allowing for the execution of multiple proposals simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function could potentially run out of gas if the `require` statement checking the balance condition consumes too much gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
