Based on the contract provided, here are the potential vulnerabilities present:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract contains operations that update the state of variables (e.g., proposal.sTime, proposal.votedAmount) in different functions without proper synchronization and checks, potentially leading to inconsistent states.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas limit for the operations performed, which could result in transaction failures due to running out of gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables is not explicitly defined in the contract, which may lead to unintended accessibility by external parties or contracts.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities found in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
