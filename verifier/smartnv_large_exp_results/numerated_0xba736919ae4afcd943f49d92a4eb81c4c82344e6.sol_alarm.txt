The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract, but it doesn't account for the possibility of reentrancy attacks or other changes in state that could occur during the execution.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` performs multiple state updates and calculations which could potentially require a significant amount of gas to execute, leading to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which could lead to accessibility issues or unintended modifications.

4) Privilege escalation: The `Proposal` struct includes an `addr` field which is not clearly defined or validated, potentially opening the contract to privilege escalation attacks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, and privilege escalation.
