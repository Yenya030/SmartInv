The contract provided is:

```solidity
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    uint public depositAmount;
    bool public isFundsReleased;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, uint _depositAmount) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        depositAmount = _depositAmount;
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can release funds");
        require(!isFundsReleased, "Funds have already been released");
        
        payable(seller).transfer(depositAmount);
        isFundsReleased = true;
    }

    function refundBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only seller can refund buyer");
        require(!isFundsReleased, "Funds have already been released");
        
        payable(buyer).transfer(depositAmount);
        isFundsReleased = true;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The functions `releaseFunds` and `refundBuyer` can only be called by the seller, which may not be the desired behavior. It should be clarified whether only the seller or both parties should have access to these functions.

2) Inconsistent State Update: There is a risk of inconsistent state update if `isFundsReleased` is not updated atomically and can be manipulated by reentrant calls or external influences.

3) Suicidal Contracts: There is no protection against a malicious `selfdestruct` operation that could potentially destroy the contract and its functionalities. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are Incorrect Visibility/Ownership, Inconsistent State Update, and Suicidal Contracts.
