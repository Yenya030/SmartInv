Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `WETH`, `USDC`, `pair`, `debt`, and `collateral` is set to public, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the `calculatePrice` function if the balance of `pair` becomes very large.
- Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function for determining if a user's fund can be liquidated may be vulnerable to arithmetic flaws.
- Business logic flaw: The logic in the `liquidate` function may not properly handle all edge cases, leading to unexpected behavior.
