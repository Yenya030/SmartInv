Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function does not update the `proposal.sTime` after the execution, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may lead to incorrect visibility and access control issues.
3) Business logic flaw: There may be an issue with the business logic in the `endExecute` function where the execution is considered failed if the locked funds are not greater than twice the total supply of the voting token, but the condition may not accurately represent the intended logic.
