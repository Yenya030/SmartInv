The potential vulnerabilities in the contract to analyze are:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not check for ID uniqueness when adding or changing owners, which could lead to multiple owners having the same address.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `isOwner` mapping is public, which may expose sensitive information about ownership to external parties.
3) Business logic flaw: The logic for removing an owner is missing, which could lead to inconsistent states or unexpected behavior when removing an owner.
4) Inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state when changing owners as the `removeOwner` and `addOwner` functions are called separately, which may result in unexpected behavior.
