Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is being accessed in the functions without any visibility specifier, which could lead to potential issues with ownership and accessibility.

2) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' variable is being updated directly in the 'execute' function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function includes a complex computation 'votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()' which could potentially consume a lot of gas, leading to out-of-gas errors during execution.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The 'declare startingBlance' and 'proposal.votedAmount += amount' operations could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.

5) Ether leakage: There is a lack of handling Ether transactions in the contract, which could lead to Ether leakage or unintended Ether transfers if not managed correctly.
