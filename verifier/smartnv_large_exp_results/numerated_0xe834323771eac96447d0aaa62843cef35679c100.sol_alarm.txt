This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:
2) Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute" updates the "proposal" state and "startingBalanceList", but there is no atomicity ensuring that both updates occur or fail together, which can lead to inconsistent state.
5) Atomicity violation: The function "execute" contains multiple state changes that are not wrapped in a single atomic transaction, potentially leading to atomicity violations.
7) ID uniqueness violation: The "proposal" struct does not have a unique identifier for each proposal, which may lead to ID uniqueness violations and confusion.
12) Ether leakage: There are no checks or mechanisms to prevent unintended ether transfers in the contract, leading to potential ether leakage vulnerabilities.
