The contract provided for analysis is:

contract MyContract {
     address public owner;
     uint public balance;

     function deposit() public payable {
         balance += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw(uint amount) public {
         require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
         msg.sender.transfer(amount);
         balance -= amount;
     }

     function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can change owner");
         owner = newOwner;
     }
}

Output: 
- privilege escalation
- inconsistent state update
- incorrect visibility/ownership
