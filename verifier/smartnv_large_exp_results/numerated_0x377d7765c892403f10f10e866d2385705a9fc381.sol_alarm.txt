The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities:

contract Marketplace {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public prices;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function setPrice(uint _price) public {
        prices[msg.sender] = _price;
    }

    function buy() public payable {
        require(msg.value >= prices[msg.sender], "Insufficient payment");
        owner.transfer(msg.value);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Marketplace contract:
1) Price manipulation
2) Reentrancy
