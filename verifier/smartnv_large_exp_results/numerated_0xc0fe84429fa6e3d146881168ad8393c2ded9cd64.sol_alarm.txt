The contract provided for analysis:

contract SecureVault {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance += msg.value;
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can transfer ownership");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}

Output:
- potential vulnerability:  incorrect visibility/ownership
- potential vulnerability: integer overflow/underflow
