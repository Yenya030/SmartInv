Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to only authorized users. This could lead to unauthorized users executing critical functions.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state of `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` in the `startExecute` function, but it does not ensure that the updates are done atomically or in the correct sequence, leading to inconsistent state.

3) Atomicity violation: The contract does not ensure that multiple state changes occur atomically. If an operation fails after a state change has been made but before subsequent changes, the contract could be left in an inconsistent state.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of certain variables and functions, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations without proper checks for potential integer overflow or underflow, which could result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transfers securely, potentially allowing for ether leakage or unexpected transfers of funds.

7) Incorrect conditional checks: The contract uses conditional statements to control the flow of execution, but the conditions may not always accurately reflect the desired logic, leading to vulnerabilities in the contract's behavior.
