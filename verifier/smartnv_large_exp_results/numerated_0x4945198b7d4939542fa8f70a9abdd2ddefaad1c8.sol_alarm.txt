Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no explicit check to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or users, which could lead to conflicts or overwrite existing data.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the proposal struct is updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization or checks, leading to potential inconsistencies.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` and `votingToken` variables are declared as internal, which may not be intended and could lead to visibility or ownership issues.
4) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than available depending on the amount and actions taken, potentially causing the transaction to revert.
5) Business logic flaw: There may be potential flaws in the business logic of the contract, such as the conditions for execution or the handling of voting amounts, which could be exploited by malicious actors.
