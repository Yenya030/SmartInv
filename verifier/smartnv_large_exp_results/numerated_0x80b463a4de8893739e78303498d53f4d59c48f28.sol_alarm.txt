The contract to analyze:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public price;
    bool public buyerPaid;
    bool public sellerPaid;
    bool public disputeResolved;
    
    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _price) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        price = _price;
        buyerPaid = false;
        sellerPaid = false;
        disputeResolved = false;
    }
    
    function paySeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only the buyer can pay the seller");
        require(address(this).balance >= price, "Insufficient funds in escrow to pay the seller");
        seller.transfer(price);
        sellerPaid = true;
    }
    
    function payBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller, "Only the seller can pay the buyer");
        require(buyerPaid == true, "Buyer has not paid yet");
        buyer.transfer(price);
    }
    
    function resolveDispute(bool verdict) public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only the arbiter can resolve the dispute");
        disputeResolved = true;
        if (verdict == true) {
            seller.transfer(address(this).balance);
        } else {
            buyer.transfer(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions paySeller, payBuyer, and resolveDispute may potentially allow unauthorized users to perform actions meant for specific parties (e.g., buyer paying instead of seller, non-arbiter resolving dispute).
- Insufficient gas: The resolveDispute function could potentially run out of gas during execution if the balance of the contract is very high, leading to an incomplete or failed resolution of the dispute.
