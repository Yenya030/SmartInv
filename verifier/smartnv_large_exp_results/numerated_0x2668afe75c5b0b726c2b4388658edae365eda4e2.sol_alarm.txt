Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "debt" and "collateral" mappings is set to public, which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "liquidate" function updates the "debt" and "collateral" mappings without proper validation, which may lead to inconsistent data state.
3) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the "liquidate" function may result in arithmetic flaws due to potential integer overflow/underflow issues.
4) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract interacts with external tokens (USDC and WETH) without proper validation, which may lead to cross-bridge inconsistency issues.
