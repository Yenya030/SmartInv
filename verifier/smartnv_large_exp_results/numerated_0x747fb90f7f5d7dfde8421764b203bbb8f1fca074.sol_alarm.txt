The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variable `proposal` and `lockedFunds` are not specified with any visibility modifier, which may lead to incorrect ownership or visibility control.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may fail due to insufficient gas if the gas limit is reached during the execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
