The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are as follows:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface IERC20, which suggests that it should be inheriting from it instead of declaring it in the contract. This can lead to confusion and potential issues with contract functionality.

2) Inconsistent state update: The 'execute' function is updating the state variables 'proposal.votedAmount' without utilizing the 'Proposal' struct in storage properly, which can lead to inconsistent state updates and potential issues with the contract logic.

3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function checks for a condition that involves calculating the balance of the contract, which can consume a significant amount of gas if the contract has a large number of token holders, potentially leading to a gas exhaustion issue.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
2) Inconsistent state update
3) Insufficient gas
