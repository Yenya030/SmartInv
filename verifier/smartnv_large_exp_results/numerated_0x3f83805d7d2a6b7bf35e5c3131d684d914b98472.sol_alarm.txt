Contract to analyze:

contract SafeVoting {
     struct Voter {
          uint256 tokens;
          bool hasVoted;
          address delegate;
          }
     mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
     IERC20 public token;
     address public owner;

    function delegate(address to) public {
             require(to != msg.sender, "cannot delegate to yourself");
             require(voters[msg.sender].hasVoted == false, "already voted");
             voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;
        }

    function vote(uint256 amount) public {
             require(voters[msg.sender].tokens >= amount, "not enough tokens to vote");
             require(voters[msg.sender].hasVoted == false, "already voted");
             voters[msg.sender].tokens -= amount;
             voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = true;
        }

    function endVoting() public {
             require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can end voting");
             // logic to calculate the result and end the voting process
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
3) business logic flaw: The endVoting function does not implement the logic to calculate the result and end the voting process, leaving the contract vulnerable to manipulation or incorrect outcomes.
8) reentrancy: The contract is susceptible to reentrancy attacks, as there are no checks in place to prevent reentrant calls in the delegate and vote functions.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which exposes ownership information and potentially allows unauthorized access to sensitive functions like endVoting. Consider changing the visibility of owner to private to enhance security.
