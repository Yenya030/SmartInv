Contract to analyze:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > highestBid, "Must bid higher than current highest bid");
        
        if (highestBid != 0) {
            highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        }
        
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only the highest bidder can withdraw");
        
        msg.sender.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBid = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- atomicity violation
- inconsistent state update
