The contract provided for analysis:

contract Insurance {
    IERC20 public DAI;

    constructor(address _owner, address _DAI) {
        owner = _owner;
        DAI = IERC20(_DAI);
    }

    function buyInsurance(uint amount) public {
        require(DAI.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient DAI balance");
        DAI.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        // logic for buying insurance 
    }

    function claimInsurance() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can claim insurance");
        // logic for claiming insurance 
    }
}
