The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
2) Privilege escalation: The `closeChannel` function allows the recipient to close the channel and transfer the specified amount. If there is a vulnerability in the signature verification logic, an attacker could potentially close the channel and transfer funds without the valid signature.
6) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a possibility of cross-bridge inconsistency if the transfer functions (`transfer`) fail, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state where funds are not properly allocated between the sender and recipient.
