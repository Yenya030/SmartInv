The contract provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total supply of the token as a condition for successful execution, which may not accurately reflect the intended logic.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` variable inside the `proposal` struct without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not provide the intended visibility or ownership control in the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
