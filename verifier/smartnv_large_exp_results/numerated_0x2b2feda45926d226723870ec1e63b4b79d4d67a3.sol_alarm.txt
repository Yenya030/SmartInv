Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the data structures like proposal and startingBalanceList, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking for reentrancy, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Atomicity violation: There is a potential lack of atomicity in the `execute` function as the transferFrom and state update operations are not wrapped in a single atomic operation.
4) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function might require more gas if the `votingToken.transferFrom` or `votedProposal` function consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to transaction failures.
5) Privilege escalation: The `endExecute` function allows all fund transfers to the `lockedFunds` variable without proper checks, which could lead to unauthorized privilege escalation.
