The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variable proposal, but the startingBalanceList mapping is not updated consistently with it, which could lead to inconsistencies in the data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not define all the required functions, such as transferFrom. This could lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect the full interface to be implemented.

3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() consumes gas in multiple require statements, which could potentially lead to out-of-gas errors if the gas provided by the caller is not enough to cover all the requirements.

Overall, the contract has some potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure the security and reliability of the smart contract system.
