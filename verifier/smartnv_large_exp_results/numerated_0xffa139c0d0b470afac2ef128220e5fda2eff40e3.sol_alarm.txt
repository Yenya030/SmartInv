The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any condition checks or validation, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votedProposal` function is referenced in the `execute` function but is not defined or declared within the contract. This could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the execution failed using a comparison that involves the total supply and the balance of the contract, which could potentially cause insufficient gas issues.
