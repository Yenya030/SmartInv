The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable directly without any checks or restrictions.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any access modifiers for the state variables `owner` and `votingToken`, making them publicly accessible.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` relies on the gas estimation of `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, which can potentially lead to gas exhaustion issues.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
