The contract provided for analysis:
contract PaymentSplitter {
    address[] internal payees;
    mapping(address => uint256) internal shares;
    address internal owner;

    constructor(address[] memory _payees, uint256[] memory _shares) public payable {
        require(_payees.length == _shares.length, "Payees and Shares length mismatch");
        owner = msg.sender;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _payees.length; i++) {
            payees.push(_payees[i]);
            shares[_payees[i]] = _shares[i];
        }
    }

    function release() public {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < payees.length; i++) {
            address payable payee = address(uint160(payees[i]));
            uint256 amount = shares[payee] / 100 * address(this).balance;
            payee.transfer(amount);
        }
    }
}

Output:
- Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the release function (uint256 amount = shares[payee] / 100 * address(this).balance;) may result in unexpected outcomes due to potential integer division rounding and multiplication issues.

Overall assessment: The contract contains an arithmetic flaw vulnerability.
