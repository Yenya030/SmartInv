The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the voted amount in the proposal without ensuring proper synchronization and potential race condition issues with the `votedProposal` function.
2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which could lead to potential conflicts or overridden proposals.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not explicitly defined in the contract, and its visibility and ownership status are unknown, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.

Overall, the contract requires improvements to address these vulnerabilities.
