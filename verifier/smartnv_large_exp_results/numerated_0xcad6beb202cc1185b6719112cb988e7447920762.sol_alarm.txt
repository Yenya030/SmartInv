potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data.
2) insufficient gas: Some functions may require more gas than is provided, leading to incomplete execution and potential vulnerabilities.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of some functions and state variables are not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation.
4) integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving arithmetic calculations without proper checks for potential integer overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected results.
