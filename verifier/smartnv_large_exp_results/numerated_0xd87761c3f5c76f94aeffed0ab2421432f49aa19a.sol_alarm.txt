The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without taking into consideration potential reentrancy issues or ensuring that the state changes are performed atomically.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, making it accessible externally which could lead to unauthorized access.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
