The potential vulnerabilities in the contract to analyze are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the functions and variables, which can lead to potential security issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: There is a risk of inconsistent state updating within the functions, which can impact the overall functionality and integrity of the contract.
3) Atomicity violation: The functions within the contract are not designed to ensure atomicity, which can lead to unexpected behavior during the execution.
