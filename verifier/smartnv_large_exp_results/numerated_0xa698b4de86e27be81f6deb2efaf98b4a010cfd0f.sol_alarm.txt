The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract ExampleContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow
2) Insufficient gas

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow and insufficient gas.
