SuWee Token Contract:
contract SuWeeToken is ERC20 {
     string public name = "SuWee Token";
     string public symbol = "SWT";
     uint8 public decimals = 18;
     uint256 public INITIAL_SUPPLY = 1000000 * (10 ** uint256(decimals));

     constructor() public {
         _mint(msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
     }

     function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
         _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
         return true;
     }
}
Vulnerabilities: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The transfer function does not enforce any access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized actors to call it.
- Insufficient gas: The transfer function does not specify the gas amount needed for the transfer, which can lead to failed transactions if insufficient gas is provided.
- Atomicity violation: The transfer function does not use the transferFrom function, which is the recommended way to handle token transfers to prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure atomicity.
- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, but it should still implement mechanisms to prevent accidental Ether transfers.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no uniqueness check on user identities during transfer, potentially leading to ID duplication issues.
- Business logic flaw: The transfer function does not include any business logic validation, leaving the contract vulnerable to logic flaws and inconsistencies.
- Inconsistent state update: The transfer function directly updates the state without proper validation or checks, which can lead to inconsistent contract states.
- Price manipulation: The contract does not directly handle price calculations, but it should ensure that any price-related operations are accurately calculated and validated to prevent manipulation.
- Arithmetic flaw: The contract's initial supply calculation relies on arithmetic operations, which can be prone to overflow or underflow vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
