The contract provided for analysis: 

contract TokenSale {
    address public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public pricePerToken;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) public {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        pricePerToken = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) external payable {
        require(msg.value == _amount * pricePerToken, "Incorrect payment amount");
        
        // Transfer tokens to the buyer
        require(IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount), "Token transfer failed");

        // Transfer Ether to the owner
        payable(owner).transfer(msg.value);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect payment amount vulnerability: The calculation of Ether payment amount based on the number of tokens purchased may lead to vulnerabilities related to incorrect payment amount.
2) Token transfer vulnerability: The lack of proper verification or conditions for token transfers may lead to vulnerabilities related to token transfers to unauthorized addresses or malicious actors. 
3) Ether transfer vulnerability: The use of transfer function for Ether transfer to the owner may be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, especially if the owner is a contract that can execute arbitrary logic upon receiving Ether. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect payment amount
2) Token transfer
3) Ether transfer (potentially reentrancy)
