The vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` in the `proposal` struct directly without taking into account potential reentrancy vulnerabilities that may arise.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` contract should have proper visibility and ownership control to restrict access to unauthorized parties.
