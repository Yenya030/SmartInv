The contract you are going to analyze and output potential vulnerabilities is as follows:

contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token; 
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(owner) >= amount * price, "Not enough tokens available for sale");
        token.transferFrom(owner, msg.sender, amount * price);
    }

    function setPrice(uint _price) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can set the price");
        price = _price;
    }
}

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
