Output:
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The functions deposit(), release(), and cancel() do not specify any visibility (public, external, etc.), which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
- Inconsistent State Update: The functions deposit(), release(), and cancel() all manipulate the amount variable without proper validation or state management, which could lead to inconsistent states and vulnerabilities.
- Cross Bridge Inconsistency: The transfer of funds in release() and cancel() functions could lead to inconsistencies or vulnerabilities if the recipient or payer is a contract that does not handle incoming transfers correctly.
