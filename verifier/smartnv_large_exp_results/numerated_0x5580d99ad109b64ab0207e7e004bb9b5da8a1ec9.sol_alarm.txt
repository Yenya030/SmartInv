The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the proposal's votedAmount without any synchronization mechanism, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the value simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail to execute if there is not enough gas to complete the required operations, leading to a potential vulnerability.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may expose it to potential access control issues if not intended.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
