The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a condition that checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply. This may lead to an inconsistent state if the condition is not appropriately handled.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `votedProposal` function. It is important to explicitly define the visibility of functions to prevent unintended access and modifications.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:  
1) Inconsistent state update  
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
