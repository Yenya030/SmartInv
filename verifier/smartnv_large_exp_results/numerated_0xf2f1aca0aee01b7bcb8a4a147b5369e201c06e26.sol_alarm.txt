The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public proposals;

    address public admin;
    bool public votingStarted;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function startVoting() public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can start voting");
        votingStarted = true;
    }

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted");

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
        Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];
        if (delegateTo.voted) {
            proposals[delegateTo.vote] += sender.weight;
        } else {
            delegateTo.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint256 proposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted");

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = proposal;
        proposals[proposal] += sender.weight;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the VotingSystem contract are:

1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, which means anyone can access and modify the admin address, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

2) business logic flaw: The delegate function has a logic error where the weight of the sender is added to the delegate's proposal even if the delegate has not voted, potentially leading to incorrect voting results.

3) inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state updates in the delegate function when updating the delegate's weight and proposal, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of voter addresses, which could lead to issues with delegate voting and tallying.

5) atomicity violation: The voting process is not atomic, as updating the state in multiple steps can lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior.

6) privilege escalation: The startVoting function allows only the admin to start the voting process, but there is no protection against the admin changing after deployment, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
