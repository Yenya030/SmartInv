- Inconsistent state update: The function `liquidate` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract updates the `debt` and `collateral` mappings but does not check for consistency in state changes, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
- Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `calculatePrice` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract may result in arithmetic flaws due to division and multiplication operations.
