The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in the contract ExchangeTokens can lead to inconsistent state updates as it manipulates the debt and collateral mappings without proper synchronization or checks.

2) Business logic flaw: The calculation of the price in the function calculatePrice in the ExchangeTokens contract could potentially have a business logic flaw if the token balances are not updated or calculated correctly, leading to incorrect price calculations.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow or underflow in the calculation of the price in the calculatePrice function if the token balances are large enough to cause such issues.
