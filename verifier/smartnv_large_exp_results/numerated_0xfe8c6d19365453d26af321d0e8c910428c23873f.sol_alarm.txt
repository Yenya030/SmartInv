The contract provided for analysis:

contract MultiSigWallet {
     mapping(address => uint) public balances;
     address[] public owners;
     address[] public pendingOwners;

     function transfer(uint amount, address recipient) external {
         require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
         balances[recipient] += amount;
     }

     function addOwner(address newOwner) external {
         pendingOwners.push(newOwner);
         if (pendingOwners.length == owners.length) {
             for (uint i = 0; i < pendingOwners.length; i++) {
                 owners.push(pendingOwners[i]);
             }
             pendingOwners = new address[](0);
         }
     }

     function removeOwner(address owner) external {
         for (uint i = 0; i < owners.length; i++) {
             if (owners[i] == owner) {
                 delete owners[i];
             }
         }
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
7) ID uniqueness violation: There is a potential issue where the removeOwner function does not properly remove the specified owner from the owners array, leading to a possible ID uniqueness violation.
8) reentrancy: The transfer function does not include any mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks, leaving the contract vulnerable to reentrancy exploits.
