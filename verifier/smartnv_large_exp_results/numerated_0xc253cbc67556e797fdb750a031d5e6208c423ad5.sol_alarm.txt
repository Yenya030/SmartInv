The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the state of the proposal by incrementing "proposal.votedAmount", but there is no proper synchronization mechanism to ensure atomicity of the update. This could lead to inconsistent state if multiple executions happen simultaneously.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "proposal" struct is declared as internal which could potentially expose sensitive information to external contracts.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function checks the balance of the contract and compares it to the total supply, which could require a substantial amount of gas if the total supply is large, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
