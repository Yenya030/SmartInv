The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 

1) privilege escalation - The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from executing functions or modifying critical data. 
2) inconsistent state update - The contract updates the state variables without ensuring that the updates are done atomically or in a consistent manner, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
3) integer overflow/underflow - There is a potential risk of integer overflow/underflow in the calculations involving uint variables, leading to unexpected results or vulnerabilities.
