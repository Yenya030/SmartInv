The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without initializing it.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, potentially leading to issues with ownership and access control.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a large amount of gas due to the comparison of `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
