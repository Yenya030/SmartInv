Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` struct without checking if a proposal is already ongoing. This could lead to inconsistent state if multiple proposals are initiated without proper handling.

2) Business logic flaw: The function `endExecute` calculates the locked funds based on the condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may not accurately reflect the intended logic of the contract.

3) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposals or addresses stored in the contract, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is accessed externally without any access control mechanism in place, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
