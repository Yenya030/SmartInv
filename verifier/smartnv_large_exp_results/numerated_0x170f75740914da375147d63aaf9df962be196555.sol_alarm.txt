The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the functions and variables, which can lead to security issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates in the functions without proper checks or synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data state.
3) Insufficient gas: The functions might require large gas amounts for execution, which can lead to out-of-gas errors or failures.
4) Privilege escalation: The contract may allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation due to lack of proper access control checks.
