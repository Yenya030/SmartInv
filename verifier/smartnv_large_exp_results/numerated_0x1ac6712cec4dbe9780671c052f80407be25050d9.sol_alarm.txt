Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The "execute" function updates the "votedAmount" field of the proposal struct, but there is no check to ensure that the total voted amount does not exceed a certain limit. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if the total voted amount goes beyond a reasonable threshold.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract implements the IERC20 interface, but it is not clear if the necessary functions like transfer are properly implemented and their visibility and ownership are correctly handled. This could lead to issues with the transfer of tokens within the contract.
