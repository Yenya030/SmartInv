The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) inconsistency state update: the variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how it is utilized or what impact it may have on the contract state.
2) atomicity violation: there are multiple state changes in the `execute` function without any checks or mechanisms to ensure that they are all executed atomically, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: the `owner` variable is declared as internal, but it is not clear how it is utilized or controlled within the contract, potentially opening up ownership-related vulnerabilities.
