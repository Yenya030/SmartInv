Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without considering potential reentrancy issues, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined as public or internal, which may lead to incorrect visibility and potential unauthorized access to the proposal data.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require a significant amount of gas if the `votingToken.transferFrom` operation fails, leading to potential out-of-gas issues.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals have the same ID.
