The potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin of the contract is directly set in the constructor and can't be changed. This may lead to centralized control and potential privilege escalation if the admin account is compromised.
2) Insufficient gas: If the "buyTokens" function requires a significant amount of gas to execute due to high token prices or large token amounts, users may run out of gas before completing the transaction.
3) Inconsistent state update: The "tokensSold" variable is being updated based on the amount of tokens sold, but there is no check to ensure that the total token supply is not exceeded, leading to potential inconsistent state updates.
