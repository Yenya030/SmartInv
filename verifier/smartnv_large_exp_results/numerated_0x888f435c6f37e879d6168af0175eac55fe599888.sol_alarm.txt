The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "votedAmount" in the Proposal struct is updated directly in the "execute" function without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController implements the interface IERC20 but doesn't fully adhere to its functions and properties, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
