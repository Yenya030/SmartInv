Potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not check whether the _voteId provided in the vote and publishVote functions is unique, leaving room for potential conflicts or incorrect data handling.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is publicly accessible, which could lead to unauthorized changes to the contract owner, posing a security risk.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is no explicit requirement to update the totalVotes variable whenever a vote is cast, which may lead to inconsistencies in the overall count of votes.
