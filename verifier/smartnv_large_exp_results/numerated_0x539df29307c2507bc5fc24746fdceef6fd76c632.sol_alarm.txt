Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent inconsistent state updates.
2) atomicity violation: The function `execute` transfers tokens and updates `proposal.votedAmount` in multiple steps without using appropriate atomic operations, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which can lead to unintended access control issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
