Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without checking for any conditions, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `calculatePrice()` function is set to public, allowing anyone to call it and potentially manipulate the price calculations.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, there may be scenarios where the contract runs out of gas before completing a critical operation, leading to unexpected behavior.
