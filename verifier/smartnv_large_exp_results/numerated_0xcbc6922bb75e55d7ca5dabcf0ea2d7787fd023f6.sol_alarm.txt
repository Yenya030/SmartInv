The contract provided for analysis:

contract Auction {
     uint public highestBid;
     address public highestBidder;

     function bid(uint bidAmount) public {
         require(bidAmount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
         highestBidder.transfer(highestBid); 
         highestBidder = msg.sender;
         highestBid = bidAmount;
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract:
- Integer overflow/underflow in the bid function, as bidAmount may be larger than the maximum value allowed for uint type variables.
