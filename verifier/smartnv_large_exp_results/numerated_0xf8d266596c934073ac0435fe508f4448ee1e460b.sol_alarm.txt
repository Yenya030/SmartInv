Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute modifies the state variable proposal.votedAmount but it does not ensure that the state update is done atomically, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions are executed concurrently.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute executes a loop to check if the execution failed, which may consume a lot of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute, which can lead to issues in terms of access control and ownership.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
