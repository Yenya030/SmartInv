Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the `balanceOf` function call on `votingToken`. However, this update can result in inconsistent state if another contract or external action changes the balance of `votingToken` before the `endExecute` function completes.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface and publicly exposes the `votingToken` state variable. This could lead to unintended access or manipulation of the `votingToken` contract by external entities.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may consume a significant amount of gas if the `votingToken.transferFrom` operation requires a significant amount of computation or storage changes. This could lead to the transaction running out of gas and failing unexpectedly. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
