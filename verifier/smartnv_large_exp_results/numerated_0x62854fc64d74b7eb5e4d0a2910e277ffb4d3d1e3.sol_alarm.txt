Contract Analysis:

The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership for the `proposal` struct and `startingBalanceList` mapping as they are not specified with any visibility keyword, making them publicly accessible.
2) Possible privilege escalation in the `startExecute` function due to allowing anyone to start a new proposal without proper authorization.
3) Lack of ID uniqueness validation for `proposal.addr` in the `startExecute` function.
4) Possible inconsistent state update in the `execute` function as the `proposal.votedAmount` is not properly updated in a single transaction.
5) Lack of atomicity in the `execute` function as multiple state changes occur without proper atomicity checks.
6) Possible ether leakage in the `endExecute` function due to lack of proper handling of funds.
7) Insufficient gas in the `endExecute` function if the execution requires a significant amount of gas to complete.
8) Lack of proper authorization or access control mechanisms for critical functions like `execute` and `endExecute`.
9) Potential business logic flaws in the `endExecute` function related to the check for execution failure based on token balances.

Overall, the contract lacks proper access control, atomicity checks, and handling of state changes, making it vulnerable to various exploits.
