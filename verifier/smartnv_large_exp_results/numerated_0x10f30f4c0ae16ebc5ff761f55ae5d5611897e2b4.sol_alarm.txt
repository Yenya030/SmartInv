The contract you provided is:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "only buyer or seller can deposit");
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "only arbiter can release funds");
        // release funds to seller
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "only arbiter can refund funds");
        // refund funds to buyer
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The release() and refund() functions do not include logic to update the state indicating that funds have been released or refunded, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions deposit(), release(), and refund() do not include access control modifiers to restrict who can call them, potentially allowing unauthorized users to interact with the contract.
