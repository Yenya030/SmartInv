The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Atomicity violation: The startExecute function modifies multiple state variables without using any synchronization mechanism, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates if another function is called concurrently.

2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount variable without explicitly checking for overflows or underflows, which could result in inconsistent state updates if the amount passed is large enough to cause an overflow.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is not clearly specified or enforced, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation if the owner-related functions are not restricted properly.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: The endExecute function calculates the total locked funds by subtracting the balance of the contract from twice the total token supply without checking for potential integer overflows or underflows.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions explicitly, leaving it vulnerable to Ether leakage if Ether is sent to the contract without any intended usage or processing.

6) Insufficient gas: Operations such as transferring tokens or calculating balances may consume a significant amount of gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas exceptions if the gas limit is not set appropriately for these operations.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are atomicity violation, inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, integer overflow/underflow, ether leakage, and insufficient gas.
