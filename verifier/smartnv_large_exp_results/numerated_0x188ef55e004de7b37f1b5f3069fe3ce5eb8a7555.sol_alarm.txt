potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) integer overflow/underflow: there is a possibility of an overflow in the calculations in the liquidate function regarding getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: the variables debt and collateral are public, which might expose sensitive information.
