The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The arithmetic operation in the `liquidate` function could potentially lead to arithmetic flaws depending on the values of `getPrice()`, `cAmount`, and `dAmount`.

3) Insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice` function requires `payable` but does not contain any functionality that requires payment, which could potentially lead to wasted gas by users.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, arithmetic flaw, and insufficient gas.
