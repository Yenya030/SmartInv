- Inconsistent state update: The contract could potentially have inconsistent state updates as there are multiple state variables being modified without proper synchronization mechanisms, leading to possible data inconsistencies.
- Insufficient gas: The contract might face gas issues if the operations consume more gas than provided, potentially causing the transactions to fail due to out-of-gas errors.
