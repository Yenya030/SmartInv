The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any protection against re-entrancy, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` claims to implement the `IERC20` interface, but it does not actually implement any of the interface functions, which can lead to incorrect contract behavior and ownership vulnerabilities.
