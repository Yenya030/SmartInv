Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle the updating of the proposal state consistently, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider gas limitations, which may result in transactions failing due to running out of gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, leaving room for unauthorized access or manipulation.
