Output:
- atomicity violation: The transfer and balance update operations in the withdraw and transfer functions are not done atomically, which can lead to inconsistencies if one of the operations fails.
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is initialized in the constructor using msg.sender, but it is not explicitly defined with any visibility specifier, potentially opening it up to unintentional changes.
