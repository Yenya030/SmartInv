Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control checks to prevent unauthorized parties from executing functions.
- Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is not properly updated, which could lead to incorrect results.
- Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which could lead to visibility issues and potential ownership vulnerabilities.
