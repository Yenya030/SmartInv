The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without initializing the Proposal struct which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the variables owner, votingToken, proposal, and startingBalanceList, which can lead to incorrect access control or ownership concerns.
