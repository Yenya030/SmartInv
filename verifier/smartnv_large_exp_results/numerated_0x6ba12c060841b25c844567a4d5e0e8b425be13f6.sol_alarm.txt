Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities related to unauthorized access or modification of these variables.
2) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is being incremented without considering potential race conditions or re-entrancy issues, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does not use any mechanisms to ensure atomicity of the transfer of tokens and the update of `proposal.votedAmount`, making it susceptible to potential inconsistencies.
4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might fail if the gas limit is reached during the execution, potentially resulting in locked funds or failed execution.
5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to guarantee the uniqueness of proposal identifiers, which can lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
6) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function relies on a condition that compares the balance of the contract with twice the total supply of the voting token, which may not accurately represent the success of an execution, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
