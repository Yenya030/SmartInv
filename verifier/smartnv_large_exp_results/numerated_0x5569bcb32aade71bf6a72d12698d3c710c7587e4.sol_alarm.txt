Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal directly, which may lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may require a large amount of gas if there are many token holders, which could result in Out of Gas exception.

Overall assessment: The contract contains potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure secure and reliable operation.
