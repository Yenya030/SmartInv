The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has variables like `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` might fail if there is not enough gas provided to execute all the necessary operations, which could result in unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but does not provide implementations for all the required functions, which can lead to unexpected interactions with other contracts.

4) Business logic flaw: The function `endExecute` checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half the total supply of the token, which might not be the correct condition for a successful execution in all cases.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
