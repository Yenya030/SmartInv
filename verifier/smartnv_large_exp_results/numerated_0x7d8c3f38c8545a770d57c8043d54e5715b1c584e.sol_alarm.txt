Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly defining it or showing how it is being used in the contract. This can lead to confusion and potentially unintended consequences.
2) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` checks for a condition that involves a loop over all balances of the token held by the contract, which can consume a large amount of gas and potentially reach the gas limit. This may result in the function becoming unable to complete successfully.
