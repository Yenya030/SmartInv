The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable, which can result in inconsistent state if not properly managed.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, making it publicly accessible which can lead to security issues.

3) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` in the `endExecute` function might have a logic flaw depending on the actual purpose of the comparison.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and business logic flaw.
