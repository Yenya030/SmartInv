Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variables 'lockedFunds' and 'proposal' are being updated in separate functions, which could lead to inconsistent state if those functions are called in unexpected orders.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is public, which may expose sensitive information to external parties.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute' function might fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow if not handled correctly.
