The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without ensuring it is in a consistent state, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which might not be the intended visibility and could lead to ownership control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might fail to execute if the gas provided is not enough for the required operations, leading to unexpected contract behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
