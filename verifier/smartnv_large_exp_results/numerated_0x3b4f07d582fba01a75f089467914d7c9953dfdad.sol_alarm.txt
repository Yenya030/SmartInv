The potential vulnerabilities in the EscrowContract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables buyerApproved and sellerApproved can be updated separately without checking if both parties have approved before finalizing the transaction.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The finalize function allows any address to call it, regardless of their role in the contract (buyer, seller, or arbiter), which can lead to unauthorized access to finalizing the transaction.
