Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The state variables `debt` and `collateral` are declared as public, which exposes the internal state of the contract to external parties. This may lead to potential security risks.
2) Business logic flaw: The `liquidate` function contains a business logic flaw where the condition for liquidation (`getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount`) might not accurately represent the intended functionality.
3) Price manipulation: The `calculatePrice` function uses the ratio of USDC balance to WETH balance to calculate the price, which could be manipulated to provide false pricing information.
