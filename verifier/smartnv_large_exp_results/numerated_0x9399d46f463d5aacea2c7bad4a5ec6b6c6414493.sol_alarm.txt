The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: In the execute function, the votedAmount is being incremented without proper synchronization leading to potential inconsistencies in the state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables startingBlance, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds are not defined or declared in the contract, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership of these variables.
