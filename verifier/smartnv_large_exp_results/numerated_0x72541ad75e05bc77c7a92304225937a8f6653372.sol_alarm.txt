The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function may have an issue with inconsistent state updates as it first checks if the proposal exists, then ends the execution and computes the locked funds. This sequence of checks and updates could potentially lead to inconsistent state if the conditions are not met in a transaction.

2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function includes a computation to check if the locked funds are more than half of the total supply, which could potentially consume excessive gas and result in an out of gas error.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not explicitly stated if the "owner" variable is meant to be publicly accessible or if it should have restricted visibility. Depending on the intention, this variable's visibility may need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
