Contract Analysis:

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal struct without checking if the proposal is already in progress, potentially allowing for multiple proposals to be started simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not accurately reflect the intended visibility and ownership control within the contract.
3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, executing functions that involve token transfers may fail if there is insufficient gas provided.

Overall, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to inconsistent state updates, visibility/ownership control, and potential gas limitations in executing transactions.
