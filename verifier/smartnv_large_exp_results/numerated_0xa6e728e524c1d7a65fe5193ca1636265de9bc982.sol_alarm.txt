The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseAmountToSeller and refundAmountToBuyer functions can be called by anyone, not just the arbiter, due to the lack of proper access control mechanisms.
2) Insufficient gas: If the amount being transferred is large, it could potentially result in out-of-gas errors during the transfer process.
3) Cross bridge inconsistency: There could be a discrepancy between the balances of the buyer, seller, and arbiter if the transfer functions fail or if there are errors in the contract logic.
