Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without proper synchronization mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistencies.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is set as internal, which may lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks depending on the intended visibility and ownership requirements of the contract.
