Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is missing the visibility specifier for the interface `IERC20`, which could lead to potential issues in accessibility and ownership control.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `execute` function, the `proposal.votedAmount` is updated without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations within the functions that do not have overflow or underflow checks, which could result in unexpected behavior due to integer overflow or underflow.
4) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the contract execution, especially in functions like `votedProposal`, which could result in failed transactions.
5) Atomicity violation: The `startExecute` and `execute` functions perform multiple operations which are not wrapped in a single transaction, potentially leading to atomicity violations.
6) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicting or duplicate IDs causing issues in the system.
