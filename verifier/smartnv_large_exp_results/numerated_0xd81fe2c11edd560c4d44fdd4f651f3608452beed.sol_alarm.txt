The potential vulnerabilities in <\example_3\> are:
- incorrect visibility/ownership: The transfer of funds in the `confirmPayment` and `cancelPayment` functions should be handled carefully to avoid unauthorized transfers of funds or loss of funds. Consider using the `transfer` function with proper checks and balances.
- atomicity violation: The operations of transferring funds in the `confirmPayment` and `cancelPayment` functions are not handled atomically, which can lead to inconsistent states or race conditions. Consider using the appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure atomicity of fund transfers.
