The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update - The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function but is not checked against the total supply in the `endExecute` function, which can lead to inconsistent state.
2) Insufficient gas - The `execute` function may fail if the gas limit is reached while transferring tokens, leading to potential DoS attacks.
3) Incorrect visibility - The `lockedFunds` variable is not defined in the contract, and access to it is not specified, potentially causing visibility issues.
