The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the variable `lockedFunds` without initializing or defining it, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which may lead to unintended access or modification by external contracts.
