The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have an inconsistent state update issue as the debt and collateral mappings are being updated without proper synchronization or validation.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract may have an arithmetic flaw as it directly divides the balance of USDC by the balance of WETH, which may result in unexpected or erroneous calculations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is recommended to specify the visibility of functions and variables explicitly to ensure proper security and access control in the contract. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are Inconsistent state update, Arithmetic flaw, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
