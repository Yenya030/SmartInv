Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly handling potential reentrancy issues.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, such as only allowing specific addresses to call critical functions like `execute` and `endExecute`.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail if there is not enough gas to execute the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
