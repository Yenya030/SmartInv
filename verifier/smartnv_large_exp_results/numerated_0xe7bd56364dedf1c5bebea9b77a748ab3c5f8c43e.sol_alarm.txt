The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly checking if it should be executed, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without using any form of locking mechanism, which could lead to race conditions.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as `internal`, which could potentially cause issues with access control.
