The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state variable `proposal` without initializing it first, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as `private`, making it accessible by external entities and potentially exposing sensitive information.
3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` may run out of gas during the `require` statement that checks for the execution's success, potentially causing the function to fail prematurely.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
