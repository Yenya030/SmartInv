Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update:
   - The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without checking if the caller has already voted, which can lead to inconsistent state if the same user can vote multiple times.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract `TimelockController` implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide implementations for all the functions in the interface. This could lead to incorrect behavior or ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The function `endExecute` checks if the balance of the contract is greater than half of the total supply, which may consume significant gas if the token balance is large, potentially leading to gas exhaustion issues.

Overall assessment: This contract contains potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure the security and correctness of the system.
