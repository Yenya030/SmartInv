The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of IDs for proposals. This could potentially lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior if multiple proposals have the same ID.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state of the proposal directly without using proper checks and safeguards. This can lead to unexpected state changes or inconsistencies in the proposal data.

3) Insufficient gas: Some functions in the contract may require a considerable amount of gas to execute, which could result in out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions in the contract are not explicitly defined. This could lead to accessibility or security issues if the wrong entities are able to interact with them.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
