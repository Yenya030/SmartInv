Contract you are analyzing:

contract Crowdsale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public contributions;
    uint public totalContribution;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function contribute() public payable {
        contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        totalContribution += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can withdraw funds");
        uint balance = address(this).balance;
        payable(owner).transfer(balance);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which could lead to potential privilege escalation issues.
2) insufficient gas: If the `withdrawFunds` function holds a significant amount of funds, it may exceed the gas limit and fail to execute properly.
3) atomicity violation: The `withdrawFunds` function does not have a proper check to ensure atomicity of the transfer, which could result in loss of funds in case of reentrancy attacks.
4) ether leakage: If the `withdrawFunds` function is called with a large gas stipend, it could leak ether during the transfer to the owner.
5) integer overflow/underflow: Potential for integer overflow if the total contribution exceeds the maximum uint value, leading to unexpected behavior.
