The contract mentioned in the question for analysis is:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBalance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `proposal` is being updated and accessed in different functions which may lead to inconsistencies in the state of the contract.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal but is not used in the contract. This may lead to confusion about ownership and access control.
3) Missing access control: There is no access control mechanism implemented in the contract functions, allowing anyone to call them without restrictions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and missing access control.
