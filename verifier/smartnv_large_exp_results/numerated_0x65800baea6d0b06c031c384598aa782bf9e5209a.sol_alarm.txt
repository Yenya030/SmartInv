Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the votingToken variable, making it publicly accessible. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the variable.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function modifies the state of the proposal struct without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent data state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function does not provide an explicit gas limit for the execution, which could result in out-of-gas errors during contract execution.
