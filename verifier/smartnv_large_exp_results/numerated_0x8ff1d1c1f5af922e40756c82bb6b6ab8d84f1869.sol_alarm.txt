Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which can lead to confusion or potential errors.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variables proposal and startingBalanceList in different steps, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if an error occurs in between.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variable proposal, which can potentially expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access.
4) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() executes a complex operation checking the balance of tokens which may require more gas than the default gas limit, leading to potential out-of-gas errors.
5) Atomicity violation: The functions execute() and endExecute() perform multiple state changes without using any locking mechanism, which can lead to race conditions or inconsistent state updates if called concurrently.
