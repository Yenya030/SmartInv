The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or atomicity check, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `ERC20` interface is used but the contract does not implement all the required functions, which may lead to incorrect visibility and ownership of the functions.
