The contract below may contain potential vulnerabilities:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;
     Proposal proposal;
     mapping(address => uint) startingBalanceList;
     uint lockedFunds;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable "proposal" is accessed and updated in multiple functions without proper synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies.
2) ID uniqueness violation: The Proposal struct does not have a unique identifier, which may lead to issues in tracking and managing different proposals.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract may require an excessive amount of gas for execution in certain scenarios, leading to transaction failures.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is currently set as internal, which may expose it to external contracts unintentionally. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract include inconsistent state update, ID uniqueness violation, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
