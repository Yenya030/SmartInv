The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without any proper validation or authorization checks, which could potentially lead to an inconsistent state update vulnerability.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "lockedFunds" variable is not specified, which could lead to potential issues with ownership and accessibility.
3) Insufficient gas: The gas limit for functions that involve transferring tokens (like "execute" and "endExecute") is not specified, which could lead to potential issues with insufficient gas for completing these transactions.
