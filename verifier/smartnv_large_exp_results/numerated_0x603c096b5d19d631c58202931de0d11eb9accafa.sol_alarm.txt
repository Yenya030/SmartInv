The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) The `endExecute()` function can lead to an inconsistent state update due to the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`. 
2) The `execute()` function may have insufficient gas due to potential gas limitations for transferring tokens within the function. 
3) The ownership and visibility of certain variables and functions are not clearly defined in the contract, which may lead to incorrect visibility/ownership. 
4) There is a lack of ID uniqueness enforcement for proposals, which may result in ID uniqueness violations. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, and ID uniqueness violations.
