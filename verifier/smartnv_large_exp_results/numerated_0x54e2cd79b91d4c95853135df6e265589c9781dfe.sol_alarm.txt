Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The voters mapping is public, exposing all voter information to anyone, which may compromise user privacy.
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for duplicate votes from the same address, potentially allowing a single address to vote multiple times.
- Inconsistent state update: The totalVotes count is updated directly without considering potential race conditions, leading to potential inconsistencies.
