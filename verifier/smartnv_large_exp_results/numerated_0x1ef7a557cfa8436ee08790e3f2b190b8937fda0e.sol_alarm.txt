The contract provided is:

```
contract TokenSale {
    address public admin;
    IERC20 public token;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= _amount, "Not enough tokens in contract");
        uint cost = _amount * tokenPrice;
        require(token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount), "Token transfer failed");
        require(token.transfer(admin, cost), "Token transfer to admin failed");
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract transfers tokens to the buyer and the admin in two separate steps, which could lead to inconsistent state if the second transfer fails after the first one has succeeded. Consider using a safer design pattern like the pull payment or escrow contracts to prevent this vulnerability. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `admin` variable is declared as public, which means it can be accessed and modified by anyone. It is recommended to restrict access to critical variables and functions by using appropriate access modifiers like `private` or `internal`.

3) Insufficient gas: If the contract holds a large amount of tokens, the execution of the `buyTokens` function may require a significant amount of gas, which could lead to out-of-gas errors for users trying to purchase tokens. Consider optimizing gas usage in the contract functions.

4) Business logic flaw: The contract does not perform any checks or validations on the token price calculation, which could potentially lead to vulnerabilities related to incorrect pricing calculations or manipulations.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle any Ether transactions, but if there were any unintended Ether transfers or receptions, it could lead to Ether leakage vulnerabilities. It's important to ensure that Ether transactions are handled securely in the contract.
