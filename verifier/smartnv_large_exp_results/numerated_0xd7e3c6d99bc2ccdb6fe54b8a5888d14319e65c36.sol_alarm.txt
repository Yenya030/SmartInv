The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The IERC20 interface is not implemented in TimelockController, which could lead to incorrect behaviors when interacting with ERC20 tokens.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves calculating the balance of the contract and the total token supply, which could consume a significant amount of gas and potentially fail if there is not enough gas provided.
4) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function checks the balance of the contract against twice the total token supply, which may not be a robust way to ensure successful execution.
