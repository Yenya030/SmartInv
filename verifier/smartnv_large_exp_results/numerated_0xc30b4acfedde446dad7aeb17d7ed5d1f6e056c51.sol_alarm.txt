Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract uses the 'proposal' struct to track proposals, but the state updates within the functions (startExecute, execute, endExecute) are not consistently handled. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the 'proposal' struct, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities related to data visibility and ownership control.
