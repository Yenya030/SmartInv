The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility: The `votedProposal(proposal)` function call in the `execute` function is not defined within the contract, which could lead to incorrect visibility issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function could potentially run out of gas during the execution of transactions involving token transfers, especially if the contract holds a large number of tokens.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
