Potential vulnerabilities:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The setInsurer function should only be callable by the insured, but the require statement only checks for equality of the sender with the insured address, which can be manipulated.
2) incorrect visibility/ownership: The setTotalAmountInsured function should only be callable by the insurer, but the require statement only checks for equality of the sender with the insurer address, which can be manipulated.
