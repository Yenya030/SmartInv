The contract provided for analysis:

```
contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}
```

Based on the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities identified are:

1) Inconsistent State Update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is updated directly by adding to the existing value. This could potentially lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update `votedAmount` simultaneously.

2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The visibility of variables like `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds` is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation.

3) Integer Overflow/Underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations performed without any explicit checks for potential overflow or underflow, which could lead to vulnerabilities.

4) Insufficient Gas: The operations within the functions might require higher gas limits to execute properly, and not specifying this could lead to transactions failing due to insufficient gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Inconsistent State Update, Incorrect Visibility/Ownership, Integer Overflow/Underflow, and Insufficient Gas.
