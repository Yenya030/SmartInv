Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute" updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any condition or validation, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Insufficient gas: The function "liquidate" may require excessive gas to execute, especially if the calculations or token transfers involve large numbers, which can result in out-of-gas errors.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables "debt", "collateral", "WETH", "USDC", and "pair" is set to public, potentially exposing sensitive information and functionality to external manipulation. It is advisable to use more restrictive visibility modifiers to maintain control over access rights and permissions.
