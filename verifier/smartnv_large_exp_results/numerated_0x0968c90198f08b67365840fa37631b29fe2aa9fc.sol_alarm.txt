The contract you are going to analyze is:

contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public recipient;
    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _payer, address _recipient, uint _amount) {
        payer = _payer;
        recipient = _recipient;
        amount = _amount;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == payer, "Only the payer can deposit");
        require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect amount deposited");
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == payer, "Only the payer can release funds");
        payable(recipient).transfer(amount);
    }
}


Output: 
potential vulnerabilities: 
- inconsistent state update
- incorrect visibility/ownership
