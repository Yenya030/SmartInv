Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly ensuring that the voting process has been completed and that the execution conditions are met. This could lead to incorrect state updates and potential vulnerabilities.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which could lead to potential visibility issues and hinder contract security.

Output: 
Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership.
