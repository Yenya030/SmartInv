The contract provided is:

contract Escrow {
         address public buyer;
         address public seller;
         address public arbiter;
         uint public amount;
         bool public buyerOk;
         bool public sellerOk;
         bool public arbiterOk;

         function Escrow(address _seller, address _arbiter) public {
             buyer = msg.sender;
             seller = _seller;
             arbiter = _arbiter;
         }

         function accept() public {
             if (msg.sender == buyer) {
                 buyerOk = true;
             } else if (msg.sender == seller) {
                 sellerOk = true;
             } else if (msg.sender == arbiter) {
                 arbiterOk = true;
             }
         }
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:

1) privilege escalation: The accept function allows the buyer, seller, and arbiter to set the corresponding flags without proper authorization checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
2) inconsistent state update: The accept function updates the flags independently without checking if the previous state allows for the update, which may result in inconsistent contract state.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables buyerOk, sellerOk, and arbiterOk are public, allowing anyone to access and modify them directly, which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract state.
