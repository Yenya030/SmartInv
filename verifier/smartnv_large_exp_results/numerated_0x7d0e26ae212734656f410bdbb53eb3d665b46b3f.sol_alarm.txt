Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update the proposal state in the execute function, which could lead to incorrect execution of proposals.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not properly define the required functions, which could result in incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that rely on the interface.
