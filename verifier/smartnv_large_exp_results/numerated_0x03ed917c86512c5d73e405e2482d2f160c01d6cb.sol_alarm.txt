This contract potentially contains the following vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` struct with a new proposal, but the `execute` and `endExecute` functions reference the `proposal` variable without providing a way to distinguish between different proposals or ensuring that the state updates are consistent.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the required functions of the interface, making it non-compliant with the interface standard. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
