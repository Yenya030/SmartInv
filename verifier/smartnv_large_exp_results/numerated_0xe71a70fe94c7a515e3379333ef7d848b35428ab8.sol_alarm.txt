Contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    address internal admin;
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;

    constructor() public {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote(address user, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "only admin can vote");
        votes[user] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawVotes(address user) public {
        require(votes[user] > 0, "no votes to withdraw");
        votes[user] = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The admin is the only one allowed to vote, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation if there is a flaw in the admin's account security.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin is not specified as internal or external, which can lead to ownership vulnerabilities.
3) Insufficient gas: If the contract runs out of gas during a vote or withdrawal, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the VotingSystem contract are:
1) Privilege escalation
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
