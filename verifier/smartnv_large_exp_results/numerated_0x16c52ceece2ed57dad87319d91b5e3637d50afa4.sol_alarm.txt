The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update in the `startExecute` function where the `startingBlance` variable is initialized as `startingBlance` instead of `startingBalance`.
2) Insufficient gas in the `endExecute` function where the gas limit might not be enough to execute the function due to the potentially high gas cost of the `require` statement.
3) Incorrect ownership as the contract does not define any ownership mechanism which could lead to ownership control issues.
