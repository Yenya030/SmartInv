The contract provided for analysis:

contract SupplyChain {
     struct Product {
         uint productId;
         string name;
         uint price;
         address owner;
     }
     mapping (uint => Product) public products;
     uint public productCounter;
     
     function createProduct(string memory _name, uint _price) public {
          productCounter++;
          products[productCounter] = Product(productCounter, _name, _price, msg.sender);
     }
     
     function purchaseProduct(uint _productId) public payable {
          Product storage product = products[_productId];
          require(msg.value == product.price, "Incorrect amount sent");
          address payable productOwner = payable(product.owner);
          productOwner.transfer(msg.value);
          product.owner = msg.sender;
     }
}

Output:
- Incorrect state update: The ```purchaseProduct``` function allows the current caller to become a new owner of the product without checking if they should have the privilege. This could potentially lead to unauthorized ownership change of a product.
- Inconsistent state update: The ```purchaseProduct``` function updates the owner address without checking if the transaction succeeded or failed, which may lead to an inconsistent state of the contract.
- Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify gas requirements for the functions, which may lead to out-of-gas exceptions during execution. It is advisable to define and manage gas requirements properly in complex or lengthy operations.
