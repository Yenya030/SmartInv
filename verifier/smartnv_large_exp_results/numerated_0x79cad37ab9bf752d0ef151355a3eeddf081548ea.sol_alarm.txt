The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract PaymentGateway {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the `PaymentGateway` contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership for the `admin` variable.
2) Insufficient gas in the `withdraw` function.
3) Integer overflow/underflow in the `balances` mapping.

Therefore, the output should be:
- incorrect visibility/ownership
- insufficient gas
- integer overflow/underflow
