The contract provided for analysis:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Business logic flaw: 
- The function startExecute() relies on the proposal.sTime being 0 to determine if there is an ongoing proposal, but this check may not be sufficient or accurate. 
- The execute() function also has business logic vulnerabilities as it relies on the timing (24 hours) for execution and the votedAmount being 0, which might not cover all possible scenarios accurately. 
- The endExecute() function's business logic may have flaws as it only checks if the execution has ended based on time and has a condition that could potentially lead to execution failure based on the balance comparison.
2) Incorrect visibility: 
- The visibility of the state variables like proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds is not specified, which might lead to potential issues with access control.
3) Inconsistent state update: 
- The update of state variables like proposal.votedAmount inside the execute() function might not be done atomically which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
4) Insufficient gas: 
- There might be a risk of running out of gas during the function executions, especially if the functions are doing a lot of computations or gas-intensive operations.
5) Possible privilege escalation: 
- Depending on the ownership and access control mechanisms not shown in the provided code, there might be a potential privilege escalation issue in the contract.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Business logic flaw
2) Incorrect visibility
3) Inconsistent state update
4) Insufficient gas
5) Privilege escalation
