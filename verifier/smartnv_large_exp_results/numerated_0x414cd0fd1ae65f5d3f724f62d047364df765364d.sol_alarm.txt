The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization control, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are processed concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is accessed directly by external callers in the function endExecute without any access control or validation, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the variable.

3) Integer underflow: In the liquidate function, there is a potential risk of integer underflow if the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` results in a value greater than dAmount.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Integer underflow
