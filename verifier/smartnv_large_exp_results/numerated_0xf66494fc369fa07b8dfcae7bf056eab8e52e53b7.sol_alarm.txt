Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation in buyTokens function could potentially lead to integer overflow if _amount is a very large value, causing unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is public, which may expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to contract state. 

Output:
Integer overflow/underflow, Incorrect visibility/ownership
