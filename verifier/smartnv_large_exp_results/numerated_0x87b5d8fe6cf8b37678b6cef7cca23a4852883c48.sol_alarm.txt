The contract provided for analysis:

<\contract\>
 contract SwapTokens {
     IERC20 public tokenA;
     IERC20 public tokenB;

     function swap(uint amountA, uint amountB) external {
         tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
         tokenB.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountB);

         tokenA.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
         tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountA);
     }
 }
<\contract\>

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update: The contract swaps tokens between users but updates the state inconsistently, which could result in incorrect token balances.
- Insufficient gas: The swap function performs multiple token transfers which could exceed the gas limit, resulting in failed transactions or unexpected behavior. 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract's tokenA and tokenB variables are public, which may expose sensitive information about the tokens being swapped.
