potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Inconsistent state update: The function `execute()` updates the `votedAmount` field of the `Proposal` struct directly, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility level.
- Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of `endExecute()` due to the transfer operation, which could result in the function failing to complete successfully.
