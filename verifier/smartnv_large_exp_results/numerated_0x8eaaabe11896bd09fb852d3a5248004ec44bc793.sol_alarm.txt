The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without ensuring that it is in a consistent state before doing so.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The owner variable is marked as internal, which may lead to unexpected access control issues.

3) Insufficient gas:
   - The endExecute() function may fail due to running out of gas when checking the condition 'votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()'. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
