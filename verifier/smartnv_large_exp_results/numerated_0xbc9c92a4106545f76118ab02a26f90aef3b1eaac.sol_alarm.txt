There are potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract. The vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented directly in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership:
- The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but doesn't provide the necessary functions for token transfers, which could result in incorrect visibility or ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas:
- The `execute` function performs token transfers but doesn't handle potential out-of-gas exceptions, which may result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
