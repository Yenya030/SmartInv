The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The functions `votedProposal` and `getStartingBalance` are not defined in the contract, which may lead to visibility issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `startingBalanceList` without initializing it, which may result in inconsistent state updates.
3) Lack of access control: The `proposal` struct can be modified by any user, leading to potential privilege escalation.
4) Insufficient input validation: There is no validation for the input `amount` in the `execute` function, potentially leading to an atomicity violation or input-related vulnerabilities.
