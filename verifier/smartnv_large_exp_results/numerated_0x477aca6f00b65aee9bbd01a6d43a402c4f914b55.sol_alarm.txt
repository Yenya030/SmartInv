The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Reentrancy: The contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks as it calls external contracts (votingToken.transferFrom) before updating the state variables, allowing an attacker to exploit this by re-entering the function and manipulating the state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The implementation of the interface IERC20 is missing in the contract, which could lead to visibility issues and potential vulnerabilities related to access control.

3) Inconsistent state update: The state variables like proposal.votedAmount are updated directly without proper validation and checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates and unexpected behavior in the contract.

4) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() checks for a condition that requires a gas-intensive operation (checking the balance against the total supply), which could potentially run out of gas and make the contract unusable. 

5) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate() function may have an arithmetic flaw in the condition checking if the funds can be liquidated properly, which could result in unexpected behavior or loss of funds.
