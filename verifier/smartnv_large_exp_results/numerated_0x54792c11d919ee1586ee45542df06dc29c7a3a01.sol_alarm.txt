The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, but there is no check to ensure that the `proposal` struct is stored back in the correct state variable.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is accessed and updated without proper visibility or ownership control, leaving it exposed to potential manipulation.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract, but if the gas limit exceeds during the operation, it may result in insufficient gas to check the condition properly.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure that the `proposal` struct's address is unique, which could lead to conflicts or incorrect data storage.
5) Possible reentrancy: The `execute` function interacts with another contract (`votingToken.transferFrom`) before updating the state variables, leaving it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
