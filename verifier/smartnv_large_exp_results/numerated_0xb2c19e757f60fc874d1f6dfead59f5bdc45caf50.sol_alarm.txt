The contract to be analyzed:

contract Crowdsale {
     address public owner;
     mapping(address => uint) public contributions;
     uint public totalContributions;

     constructor() {
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function contribute() public payable {
         contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
         totalContributions += msg.value;
     }

     function withdraw() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner can withdraw funds");
         uint amount = address(this).balance;
         owner.transfer(amount);
     }

     function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
         return address(this).balance;
     }
}

In the contract Crowdsale, the potential vulnerabilities are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The withdraw function can be accessed by anyone, not just the owner, allowing unauthorized withdrawal of funds.
- Insufficient gas: The withdraw function transfers the entire balance of the contract to the owner in a single transaction, which may exceed the gas limit and fail to execute successfully.
