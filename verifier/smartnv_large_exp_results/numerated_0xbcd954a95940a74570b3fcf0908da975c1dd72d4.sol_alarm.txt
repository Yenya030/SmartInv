Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The operation `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` in the execute function may lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` are all public, which may expose the internal state of the contract and allow unauthorized access.

3) Insufficient gas: The operation `lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));` in the endExecute function may require significant gas if the balance of the token is large, leading to insufficient gas issues.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Insufficient gas
