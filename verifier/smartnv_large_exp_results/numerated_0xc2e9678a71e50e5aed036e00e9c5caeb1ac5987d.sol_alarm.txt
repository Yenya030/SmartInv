Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on a condition that checks if the total balance of the contract is greater than twice the total supply of the voting token. This could lead to an inconsistent state if the condition is not properly checked or updated.
