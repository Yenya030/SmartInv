Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for unique IDs for proposals which could lead to conflicts or manipulation.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state is updated in the `execute` function before transferring tokens, which could lead to inconsistent states if the transfer fails.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs a loop over all balances, which could potentially run out of gas and lead to incomplete execution.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like `owner` and `votingToken` is not specified, which could lead to potential security issues.
