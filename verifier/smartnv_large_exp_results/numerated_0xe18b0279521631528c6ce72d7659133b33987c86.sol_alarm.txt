The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update - The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking if a proposal is already in progress, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

2) ID uniqueness violation - There is no mechanism in place to enforce the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could result in conflicts or unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not specify any ownership control or access restrictions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to critical functions.
