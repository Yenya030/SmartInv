The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The `owner` variable is declared as internal. It should be set as private to restrict access only within the contract.
2) Inconsistent state update:
   - The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, leading to a potential inconsistent state update.
3) Integer overflow/underflow:
   - There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation in the `execute` function where `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` is performed without any checks or mitigation for overflow.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are related to incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, and integer overflow/underflow.
