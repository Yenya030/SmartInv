The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable in the `endExecute` function is updated directly without considering the atomicity of the operation, which may lead to inconsistent state if multiple operations try to update it simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is accessed directly by external function calls without proper visibility control, which may expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
