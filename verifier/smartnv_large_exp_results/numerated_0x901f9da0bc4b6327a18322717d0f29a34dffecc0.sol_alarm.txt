Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates `proposal.votedAmount` without updating `proposal` itself, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of `lockedFunds` is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of this variable.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
