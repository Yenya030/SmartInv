contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public admin;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _tokenPrice) {
        token = _token;
        admin = msg.sender;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public {
        uint totalPrice = _amount * tokenPrice;
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        admin.transfer(totalPrice);
    }
}
The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: The multiplication operation in buyTokens function could lead to an integer overflow if _amount or tokenPrice is very large.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The admin variable is public, allowing anyone to potentially change the admin address, which could lead to privilege escalation.
3) Ether leakage: The admin.transfer(totalPrice) statement transfers Ether to the admin address, which can cause Ether leakage if the admin address is a contract that does not have a fallback function to handle incoming Ether.
4) Insufficient gas: If the admin address is a contract with a high gas consumption in its fallback function, the transfer of Ether in buyTokens may fail due to insufficient gas.
