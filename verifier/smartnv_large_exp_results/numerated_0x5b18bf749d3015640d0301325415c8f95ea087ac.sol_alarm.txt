The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public escrowAmount;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        escrowAmount = _amount;
    }

    function releaseAmountToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
        seller.transfer(escrowAmount);
    }

    function refundAmountToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund funds");
        buyer.transfer(escrowAmount);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The releaseAmountToSeller and refundAmountToBuyer functions can be called by anyone, not just the arbiter as intended.
- Insufficient gas: If the escrowAmount is too large, it may exceed the gas limit when transferring funds, resulting in a failed transaction.
