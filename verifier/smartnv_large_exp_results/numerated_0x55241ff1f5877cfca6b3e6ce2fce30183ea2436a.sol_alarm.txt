Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mappings without any validation or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state if not handled carefully.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs arithmetic operations without proper overflow/underflow protection, which could result in unexpected behavior if the values exceed the maximum limit of uint.
3) Insufficient gas: The liquidate function in the ExchangeTokens contract performs multiple token transfers, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas and lead to out of gas errors if not enough gas is provided.
