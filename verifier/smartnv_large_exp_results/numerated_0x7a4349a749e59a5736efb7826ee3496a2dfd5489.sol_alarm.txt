Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The `liquidate` function may have a business logic flaw as the condition `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount` may not accurately reflect the intended liquidation logic.
2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential integer overflow/underflow in the `calculatePrice` function when performing the division `(USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) / WETH.balanceOf(address(pair))` if the values are large.
