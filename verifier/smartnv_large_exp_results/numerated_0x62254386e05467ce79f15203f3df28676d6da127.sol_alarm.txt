The contract provided for analysis is:

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20 public tokenA;
    IERC20 public tokenB;

    function swap(uint amountA, uint amountB) public {
        require(tokenA.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountA, "Insufficient balance for tokenA");
        require(tokenB.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountB, "Insufficient balance for tokenB");

        tokenA.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountA);
        tokenB.transfer(msg.sender, amountB);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for the transfer of tokens between addresses, but it doesn't update the balances of the addresses involved in the swap. This can lead to an inconsistent state where the token balances are not accurate.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The tokenA and tokenB variables are declared as public, which exposes them to the outside world. Depending on the intended functionality, this could potentially lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the token addresses.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSwap contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
