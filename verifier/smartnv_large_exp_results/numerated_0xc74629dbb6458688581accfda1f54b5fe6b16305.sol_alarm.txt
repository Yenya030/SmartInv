Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the required functions transfer and balanceOf, which could lead to issues with the external visibility of these functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The state variable lockedFunds is updated in the endExecute function without checking for potential reentrancy vulnerabilities or ensuring the correctness of the state transition.
3) Atomicity violation: There are multiple state changes happening in the execute function without proper atomicity considerations, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that involves querying the balance of the contract's token but does not consider potential gas limitations for this operation.
