The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, potentially leading to issues with duplicate IDs.

2) Inconsistent state update: The state of the `proposal` struct is modified in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility and ownership for some of its functions and variables, which could result in unintended access or modification by unauthorized parties.
