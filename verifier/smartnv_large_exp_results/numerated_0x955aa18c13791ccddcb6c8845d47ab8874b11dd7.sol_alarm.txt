The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variables `lockedFunds`, `startingBalanceList`, `proposal.votedAmount`, and `proposal.sTime` are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` struct are declared as internal, potentially limiting their visibility and causing issues when interacting with other contracts or external parties. 

3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the `endExecute` function due to the gas-intensive operation of checking the balance of the contract against the total supply of the voting token.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
