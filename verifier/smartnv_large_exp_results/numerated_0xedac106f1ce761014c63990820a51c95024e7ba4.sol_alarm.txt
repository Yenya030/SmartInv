In the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without any locking mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple executions happen concurrently.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable is an internal variable, which might need to be a public variable for visibility purposes depending on the contract's requirements. It's important to ensure the correct visibility is set based on the intended use of the variable.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
