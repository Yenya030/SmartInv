The contract provided:
contract Account {
         address public owner;
         uint public balance;

         function deposit() public payable {
             balance += msg.value;
         }

         function withdraw(uint amount) public {
             require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
             msg.sender.transfer(amount);
             balance -= amount;
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Integer overflow/underflow: The balance variable is of type uint, which could lead to integer overflow if the balance exceeds the maximum value that can be stored.
- Ether leakage: When transferring funds in the withdraw function, there is a possibility of ether being stuck in the contract if the transfer fails after deducting the balance.
- Insufficient gas: The transfer of funds in the withdraw function might fail due to insufficient gas provided, leading to funds being locked in the contract.
