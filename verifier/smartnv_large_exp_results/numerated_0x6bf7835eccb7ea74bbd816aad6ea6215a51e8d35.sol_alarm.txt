Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the lockedFunds variable based on a condition that might not accurately represent the state of the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) atomicity violation: The execute() function performs multiple state-changing operations without using any form of locking mechanism, potentially leading to atomicity violations.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is used without specifying the visibility (internal, public, external, private) of the functions, which can lead to accessibility issues or unexpected behaviors.
4) business logic flaw: There might be a logical flaw in the endExecute() function, where the condition for execution success is based on a comparison that may not correctly reflect the intended business logic.
