The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute" function updates the state variable "lockedFunds" without considering the impact of this update on other parts of the contract.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable is declared as public, which could potentially expose sensitive information about the token to external parties.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
