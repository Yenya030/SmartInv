Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is increased directly in the "execute" function without proper synchronization or locking mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide implementations for the required functions, which can lead to incorrect behavior and potential ownership vulnerabilities.
