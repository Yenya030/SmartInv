The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, leading to a potential inconsistent state update vulnerability.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `startingBlance` variable in the `startExecute` function is not properly scoped and might create unexpected behavior.
3) Insufficient gas: The execution of functions like `endExecute` might require excessive gas due to potential loops or extensive computations in the contract.
