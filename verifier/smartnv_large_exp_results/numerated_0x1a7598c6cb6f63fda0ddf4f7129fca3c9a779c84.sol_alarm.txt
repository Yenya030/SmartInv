The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the interface `IERC20` but does not define all the required functions, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

2) Inconsistent state update: There is a lack of proper synchronization mechanisms in functions like `startExecute` and `execute`, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute` requires a lot of gas to execute, which can lead to out-of-gas errors and failed transactions.

4) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute` function to check if the execution has failed by comparing the balance is not ideal and can lead to incorrect conclusions.

5) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs or addresses, which can lead to conflicts or overwriting of existing data.
