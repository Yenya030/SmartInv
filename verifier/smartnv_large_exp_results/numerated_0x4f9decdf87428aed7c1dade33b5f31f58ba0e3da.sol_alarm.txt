Contract to analyze: 

contract TokenSale {
    address public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;
    uint public totalSold;

    constructor(address _token, uint _price) public {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        ERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
        totalSold += _amount;
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
Output: 
- insufficient gas 
- incorrect visibility/ownership
