Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function 'endExecute' updates the 'lockedFunds' variable based on the balance of the contract without considering if the transfer tokens in 'execute' were successful or not. This could result in an inconsistent state if the tokens were not transferred successfully.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The interface IERC20 is not the proper choice for the inheritance in 'TimelockController'. It should use a contract that implements the ERC20 standard to avoid potential issues related to incorrect visibility or ownership.
