The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the variables owner, proposal, startingBalanceList, and lockedFunds, making them potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access or manipulation by external contracts.

2) Inconsistent state update: The update of proposal.votedAmount in the execute function is not properly synchronized with the state changes, which could lead to inconsistent data states and unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total token supply, which could potentially result in out-of-gas errors if the calculation requires excessive gas.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have mechanisms in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, leaving room for potential conflicts or unexpected behavior when managing multiple proposals.

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not have proper checks or mechanisms to prevent unintended Ether transfers or prevent potential loss of Ether due to external calls.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, Insufficient gas, ID uniqueness violation, and Ether leakage.
