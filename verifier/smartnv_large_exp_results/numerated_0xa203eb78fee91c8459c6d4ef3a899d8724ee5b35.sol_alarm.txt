The contract presented for analysis:

contract Auction {
         address public highestBidder;
         uint public highestBid;
         uint public endTime;

         function bid() public payable {
             require(block.timestamp < endTime, "Auction has ended");
             require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");

             if (highestBid != 0) {
                 payable(highestBidder).transfer(highestBid); 
             }

             highestBidder = msg.sender;
             highestBid = msg.value;
         }
}
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
