The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function 'startExecute()' updates the 'startingBalanceList' without initializing or declaring it.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votingToken' variable is declared as public, which may expose sensitive information.
3) Insufficient gas: The 'endExecute()' function might run out of gas due to the computation-intensive check on the execution failure condition.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
