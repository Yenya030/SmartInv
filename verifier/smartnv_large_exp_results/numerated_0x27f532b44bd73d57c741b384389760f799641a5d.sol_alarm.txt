Contract you are asked to analyze:

contract TokenSale {
     IERC20 public token;
     address public owner;
     uint public tokenPrice;

     constructor(address _token, uint _tokenPrice) {
         token = IERC20(_token);
         owner = msg.sender;
         tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
     }

     function buyTokens(uint _amount) public payable {
         uint totalCost = _amount * tokenPrice;
         require(msg.value >= totalCost, "Insufficient funds provided");

         token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
     }

     function withdrawFunds() public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
         msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
     }
}

Output: 
1) Insufficient gas
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
