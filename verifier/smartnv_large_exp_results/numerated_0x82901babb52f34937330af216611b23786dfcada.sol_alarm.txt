Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for proposals or any other entities, which could potentially lead to conflicts or errors in the system.

2) Inconsistent state update: There are various state variables being updated without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to inconsistent data states in the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: The execution of functions like `endExecute` or `liquidate` may require significant gas due to potential loops or large computations, leading to out-of-gas errors.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It's not clear if appropriate visibility (public, internal, external) and ownership (e.g., onlyOwner modifier) modifiers are set for certain functions, potentially exposing security vulnerabilities.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: There are several arithmetic operations being performed without checks for potential overflow or underflow, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

6) Business logic flaw: The overall design and logic flow of the contract may have vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious actors.

Therefore, the vulnerabilities identified in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, integer overflow/underflow, and business logic flaw.
