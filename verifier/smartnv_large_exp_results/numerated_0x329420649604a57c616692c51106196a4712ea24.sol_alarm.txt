The contract provided for analysis:

contract Lottery {
    address public manager;
    address[] public players;

    function join() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 0.1 ether, "Insufficient funds");
        players.push(msg.sender);
    }

    function pickWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can pick a winner");
        uint index = random() % players.length;
        address winner = players[index];
        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);
        players = new address[](0);
    }

    function random() private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players)));
    }
}

Output:
1) inconsistent state update
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
