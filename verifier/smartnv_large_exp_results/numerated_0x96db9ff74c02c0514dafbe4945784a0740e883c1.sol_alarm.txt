The contract under analysis: 

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 sTime; 
        uint256 votedAmount; 
        address addr; 
    }
    address internal owner;
    IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
        uint256 startingBlance;
        require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
        proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
        startingBalance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
        startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBalance; 
    }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
        require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
        votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
        proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
        votedProposal(proposal); 
    }

    function endExecute() external {
        require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
        require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
        lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw in the startExecute() function - startingBlance should be startingBalance as there is a typo in the variable name.
2) Inconsistent state update in the startExecute() function - proposal struct is updated without proper handling of existing proposals.
3) Atomicity violation in the execute() function - proposal.votedAmount is incremented without proper synchronization control, leading to potential race conditions.
4) Inconsistent state update in the execute() function - votedProposal(proposal) is called without clear indication of what this function does or what impact it may have on the proposal state.
5) Incorrect visibility/ownership - the owner variable is declared but not used or implemented in the contract, indicating potential issues with ownership control.
6) Insufficient gas - the endExecute() function may fail if gas running out due to the gas-intensive operation of comparing the balance with the total supply.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the TimelockController contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
