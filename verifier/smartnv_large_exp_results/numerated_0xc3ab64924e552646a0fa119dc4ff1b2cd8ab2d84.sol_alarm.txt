Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure unique IDs for proposals which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility level for ownership control.
3) Inconsistent state update: There are multiple state updates happening in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) without proper synchronization or checks, which could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle cases where a user might run out of gas during the execution of functions, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
