The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users only.
2) Inconsistent state update: There may be cases where the state variables are not updated in a consistent manner, leading to unexpected behavior.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow/underflow in calculations involving token amounts.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions may not be properly set, potentially leading to unauthorized access or unintended changes.
