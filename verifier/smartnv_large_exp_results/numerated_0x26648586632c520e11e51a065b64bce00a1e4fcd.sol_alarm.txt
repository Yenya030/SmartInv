The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function bid(uint _bidAmount) external {
        require(_bidAmount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = _bidAmount;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Auction contract are:
1) Reentrancy vulnerability in the bid function where the transfer to the highestBidder is done before updating the highestBidder and highestBid variables. This can allow a malicious bidder to exploit reentrancy and potentially drain the contract's balance.
2) Integer overflow/underflow vulnerability is present in the bid function since there are no checks for potential overflows or underflows when updating the highestBid variable with the _bidAmount.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the Auction contract are reentrancy and integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
