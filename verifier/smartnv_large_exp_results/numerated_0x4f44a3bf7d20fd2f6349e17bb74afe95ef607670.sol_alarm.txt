Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) atomicity violation: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute operate on the proposal struct without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates if multiple users interact with the contract concurrently.
2) inconsistent state update: The endExecute function locks the funds based on a condition involving the total supply of the voting token, which may not accurately reflect the intended logic of the operation.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not define the necessary functions, potentially causing issues with external contract interactions.
