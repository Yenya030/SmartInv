The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple calls are made simultaneously.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is defined as internal, which could lead to accessibility issues if the intention was for it to be private or public.
