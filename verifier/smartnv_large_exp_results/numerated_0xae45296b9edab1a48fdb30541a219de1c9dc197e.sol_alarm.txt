The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility (e.g., public, private) for the `proposal` variable, making it public by default. This could expose sensitive data to external parties.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or data corruption if multiple proposals with the same ID are created.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function does not handle potential concurrency issues, such as race conditions, which may lead to unexpected behavior in case of simultaneous execution.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to insufficient gas if the gas cost of the operations exceeds the available gas limit.

5) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not implement checks to prevent integer overflow or underflow, which could result in unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in arithmetic calculations.

6) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of `votingToken`, which may lead to inconsistent state if external factors change the balance during execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- ID uniqueness violation
- Atomicity violation
- Insufficient gas
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Inconsistent state update
