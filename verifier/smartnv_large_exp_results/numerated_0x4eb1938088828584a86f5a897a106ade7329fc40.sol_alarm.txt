The contract you provided for analysis is:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        uint256 vote;
    }
    
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public votes;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function giveRightToVote(address _voter) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can give right to vote");
        voters[_voter].weight = 1;
    }
    
    function vote(uint256 _proposal) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "You don't have the right to vote");
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted");
        
        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        voters[msg.sender].vote = _proposal;
        
        votes[_proposal] += voters[msg.sender].weight;
    }
    
    function endVoting() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can end the voting");

        // Find the winner based on the highest number of votes
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in this contract could be:
1) privilege escalation - The owner can give the right to vote to any address, potentially allowing for manipulation of the voting process.
2) inconsistent state update - If multiple voters vote for the same proposal simultaneously, there could be inconsistent state updates in the vote count.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is set publicly, allowing anyone to see who the owner is, which may not be desired.

Please note that the endVoting function needs to have the logic to determine the winner based on the highest number of votes, as stated in the comment.
