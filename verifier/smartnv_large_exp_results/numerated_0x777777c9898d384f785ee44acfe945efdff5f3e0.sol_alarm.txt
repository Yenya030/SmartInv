The contract you provided may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without verifying if the conditions for the update are appropriate, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function involves multiple state updates (`votingToken.transferFrom`, `proposal.votedAmount += amount`, `votedProposal(proposal)`), which are not encapsulated within a single atomic transaction. This can result in inconsistent state if one of the updates fails.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which might lead to visibility issues depending on the contract's intended functionality.

4) Insufficient gas: Depending on the complexity and gas consumption of the functions in this contract, there may be a risk of running out of gas during execution, especially for functions like `execute` or `endExecute` that involve multiple operations.

5) Business logic flaw: The logic in the `endExecute` function regarding the comparison `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` seems to be potentially flawed and could lead to unexpected behavior depending on the token supply dynamics.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: Inconsistent state update, Atomicity violation, Incorrect visibility/ownership, Insufficient gas, Business logic flaw.
