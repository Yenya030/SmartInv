The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract might face inconsistent state updates due to the lack of proper synchronization mechanisms for updating the state variables.

2) Atomicity violation: There is a possibility of atomicity violation as certain operations within functions are not explicitly handled atomically.

3) Ether leakage: There is a risk of ether leakage as there are no explicit checks or mechanisms to prevent unintended or unauthorized transfers of ether within the contract.
