The contract you provided contains the potential vulnerabilities of:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal` is being updated in the `startExecute` and `execute` functions without proper synchronization.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are marked as internal, which could lead to potential security risks if not properly controlled.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function performs balance calculations that could consume significant gas, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.
4) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure that the proposals have unique identifiers, which could result in conflicts or unexpected behavior.
5) Atomicity violation: The functions in the contract do not enforce atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent data updates or race conditions.
