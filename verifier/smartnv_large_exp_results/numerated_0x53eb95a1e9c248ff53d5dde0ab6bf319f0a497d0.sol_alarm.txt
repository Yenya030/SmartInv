The potential vulnerabilities in the EscrowContract are:
1) `refundPayment` function allows the buyer to request a refund even when the currentState is not AWAITING_DELIVERY.
2) No check is in place to prevent the seller from confirming delivery before the buyer makes a payment, which could lead to inconsistent state update.
3) The contract could experience ether leakage if there are any errors in handling ether transfers within the functions.
