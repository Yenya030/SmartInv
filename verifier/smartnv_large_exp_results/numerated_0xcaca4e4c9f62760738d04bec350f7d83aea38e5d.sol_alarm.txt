Contract TimelockController potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` variable is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the `proposal` struct simultaneously.
2) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function may require more gas than available in some situations, leading to transaction failures.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct and the `proposal.addr` are accessed and modified externally, which could lead to unauthorized access or modifications if proper access controls are not implemented.
