Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility for the struct and variables, leaving them open to potential manipulation or unauthorized access.
2) Inconsistent state update: The proposal struct is modified in multiple functions without proper validation or synchronization, leading to potential inconsistencies in the contract state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if gas is insufficient to complete the required operations, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.
