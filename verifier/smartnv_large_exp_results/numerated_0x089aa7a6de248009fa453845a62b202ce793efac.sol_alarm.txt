Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- <1> Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field of the `proposal` struct without using proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
- <2> Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `owner` variables are declared as `internal`, but they should be marked as `public` or have proper getter functions to ensure correct visibility and ownership handling.
