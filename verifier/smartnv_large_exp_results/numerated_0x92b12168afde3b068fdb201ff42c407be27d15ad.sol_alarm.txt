Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly incremented in the `execute` function without using safe arithmetic operations, which may lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is supposed to implement the interface IERC20, but the visibility specifier is missing in the contract declaration which can lead to potential issues related to access control and security. 
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total supply of the token, which may consume a significant amount of gas and potentially result in an out-of-gas error.
