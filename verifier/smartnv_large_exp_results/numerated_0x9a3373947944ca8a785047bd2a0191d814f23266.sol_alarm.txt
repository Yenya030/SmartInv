Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract: 
1) Atomicity violation in the `endExecute()` function where multiple state changes are made without being wrapped in a single transaction, leaving room for inconsistent state updates.
2) Inconsistent state update in the `endExecute()` function where the `lockedFunds` variable is updated based on the balance of the contract without taking into account potential changes in state during its execution.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership in the contract as the visibility of certain state variables and functions is not specified, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation.
