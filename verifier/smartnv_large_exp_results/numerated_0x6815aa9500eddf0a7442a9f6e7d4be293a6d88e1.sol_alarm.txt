The contract provided is:

```
contract RewardDistribution {
    mapping(address => uint) public rewards;

    function distributeRewards(uint amount) public {
        rewards[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdrawRewards() public {
        uint amount = rewards[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No rewards to withdraw");
        rewards[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow: The rewards mapping does not have any overflow or underflow protection, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the amount exceeds the maximum value that the uint type can hold.
2) Insufficient gas: The withdrawRewards function transfers all the rewards to the caller in a single transaction, which may consume a large amount of gas and potentially exceed the block gas limit.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The rewards mapping is public, which exposes the reward amounts of all addresses to external parties. It may lead to privacy concerns or unintended access to reward data.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
