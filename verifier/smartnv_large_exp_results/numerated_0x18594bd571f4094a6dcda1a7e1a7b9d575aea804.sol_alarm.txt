Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) insufficient gas - The functions do not specify gas limits which can lead to out of gas errors.
2) inconsistent state update - The state variables are updated in different functions without proper synchronization.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract does not specify the visibility of functions and variables, leading to potential visibility and ownership issues.
