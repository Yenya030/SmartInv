Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for crucial functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute, which could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute could potentially fail due to running out of gas when attempting to transfer lockedFunds if the contract balance is too low.
3) Inconsistent state update: There are potential risks of inconsistent state updates in functions like startExecute and endExecute, where certain conditions may not be properly checked before updating state variables, leading to unexpected behavior.
