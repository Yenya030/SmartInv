The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute()` function updates the `startingBalanceList` without proper initialization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not properly defined with visibility specifier, which could lead to incorrect visibility of data.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function involves multiple state-modifying operations without proper consideration of atomicity, which could lead to inconsistent state changes.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function involves potentially expensive operations like checking the balance, which could lead to insufficient gas for the operation to complete successfully.
