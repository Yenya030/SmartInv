Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The liquidate function in ExchangeTokens updates the debt and collateral mappings, but there are no checks to ensure that these mappings are updated correctly and consistently. This could lead to data inconsistencies and incorrect liquidation calculations.

2) arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in ExchangeTokens performs a division operation without proper error handling for potential division by zero scenarios. This could result in a runtime error or unexpected behavior if the denominating value is zero.
