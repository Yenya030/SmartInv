Contract:

```solidity
contract Auction {
    uint public highestBid;
    address public highestBidder;

    function bid() public payable {
        require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than current highest bid");
        if(highestBidder != address(0)){
            highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
        }
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == highestBidder, "Only highest bidder can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(highestBid);
        highestBid = 0;
        highestBidder = address(0);
    }
}
```

Output: 
- Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not handle potential overflow or underflow when dealing with bids. An attacker could manipulate the bid amount to cause an overflow or underflow.
- Atomicity violation: The operations in the `bid()` function are not atomic, allowing for potential reentrancy attacks where an attacker can manipulate the state between operations.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `highestBid` and `highestBidder` variables are public, exposing internal state to all users, which could lead to unexpected behavior or manipulation.
