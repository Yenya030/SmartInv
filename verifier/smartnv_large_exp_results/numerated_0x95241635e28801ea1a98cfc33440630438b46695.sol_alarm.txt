Contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly checking if the conditions are met, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute()` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` variable without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to atomicity violations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the `lockedFunds` variable, which could lead to incorrect visibility or ownership concerns.
