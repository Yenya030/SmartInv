The contract provided for analysis:

contract Auction {
    address public highestBidder;
    uint public highestBid;

    function placeBid(uint bidAmount) public {
        require(bidAmount > highestBid, "Bid amount must be higher than current highest bid");
        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = bidAmount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update
- Reentrancy
