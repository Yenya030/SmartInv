The contract provided for analysis: 

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {  
    struct Proposal {
          uint256 sTime; 
          uint256 votedAmount; 
          address addr; 
          }
     address  internal owner;
     IERC20 votingToken;

    function startExecute() external {
              uint256 startingBlance;
              require(proposal.sTime == 0,"on-going proposal");
              proposal = Proposal(block.timestamp, 0, msg.sender);
              startingBlance = getStartingBalance(proposal.addr);
              startingBalanceList[proposal.addr] = startingBlance; 

        }

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
              require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through"); 
              votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
              proposal.votedAmount += amount; 
              votedProposal(proposal); 

        }
    function endExecute() external {
              require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
              require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
              require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
              lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update in the functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute().
2) Integer overflow/underflow in functions execute() and endExecute().
3) Insufficient gas issue in function endExecute().
4) Possible privilege escalation due to the lack of proper access control mechanisms.
5) ID uniqueness violation in the struct Proposal.
6) Business logic flaw in function endExecute() with the condition for checking execution failure.

Overall assessment: The contract shows potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure the security and correctness of the system.
