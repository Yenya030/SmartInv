The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "execute" function updates the state of the proposal by incrementing "proposal.votedAmount" without checking if the proposal is still in progress or if the amount transferred during execution is valid.

2) Business logic flaw: The logic in the "endExecute" function to determine the success of execution may not accurately reflect the actual situation, potentially leading to incorrect outcomes.

3) Ether leakage: When transferring tokens in the "liquidate" function of the ExchangeTokens contract, there is a risk of losing Ether if the transfer fails, which may be exploited by malicious actors to drain Ether from the contract.
