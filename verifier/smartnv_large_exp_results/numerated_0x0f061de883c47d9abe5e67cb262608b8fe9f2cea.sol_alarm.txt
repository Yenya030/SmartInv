The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The state variables `votingToken` and `owner` are defined as internal, but it is unclear if this is intentional. 
2) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how this variable is being used or if this update could lead to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a potential gas issue in the `execute` function where multiple operations are performed, including transferring tokens, which could lead to running out of gas and the failure of the function.
4) ID uniqueness violation: It is not clear how the `addr` parameter in the `Proposal` struct is being generated or ensured to be unique, which could lead to ID uniqueness violation if the same address is used for multiple proposals.
5) Reentrancy: There are no checks for reentrancy in the contract, leaving it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
