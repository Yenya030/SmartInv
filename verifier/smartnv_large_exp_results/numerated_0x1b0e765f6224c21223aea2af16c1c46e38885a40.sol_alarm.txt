Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "pickWinner" function should also have the "restricted" modifier to ensure only the manager can call it.
- Insufficient gas: The transfer of balance in the "pickWinner" function could fail if there are too many players, leading to an incomplete distribution of funds.
- Ether leakage: The transfer of ETH to the winner's address may be susceptible to reentrancy attacks.
- Integer overflow/underflow: The calculation of index in the "pickWinner" function could potentially result in an integer underflow if players.length is 0.
