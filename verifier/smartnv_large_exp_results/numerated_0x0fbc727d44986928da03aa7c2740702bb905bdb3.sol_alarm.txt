The contract provided for analysis:

contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public payee;
    uint public amount;

    function deposit(address _payee) public payable {
        payer = msg.sender;
        payee = _payee;
        amount = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == payee, "Only the payee can withdraw");
        payable(payee).transfer(amount);
        amount = 0;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership - the withdraw function does not restrict access based on ownership, potentially allowing unauthorized parties to withdraw funds.
2) insufficient gas - if the contract balance runs out during the transfer in the withdraw function, it could result in a failed transaction.
3) atomicity violation - there is no atomicity guarantee in the deposit function, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions are issued concurrently.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, and atomicity violation.
