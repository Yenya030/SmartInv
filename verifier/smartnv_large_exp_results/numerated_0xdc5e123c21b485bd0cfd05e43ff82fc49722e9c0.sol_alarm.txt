The contract mentioned in the task is:

```solidity
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public voteCount;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote() public {
        voteCount[msg.sender]++;
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change owner");
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    function modifyVotes(address user, uint newVotes) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can modify votes");
        voteCount[user] = newVotes;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in this contract are:

1) Privilege escalation: The `changeOwner` and `modifyVotes` functions allow the owner to change critical aspects of the contract, which could lead to privilege escalation if unauthorized access is gained.
   
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, meaning anyone can view the current owner of the contract, which might not be desirable for security reasons.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the `VotingSystem` contract are privilege escalation and incorrect visibility/ownership.
