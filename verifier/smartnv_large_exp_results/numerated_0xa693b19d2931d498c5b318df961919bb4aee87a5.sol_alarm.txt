The contract at hand is as follows:

```solidity
contract TransferFunds {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```
The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Integer Overflow/Underflow: There is a potential for integer underflow in the `withdraw` function if the `amount` parameter is larger than the current balance of the `msg.sender`.
2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The `balances` mapping is public, which exposes all users' balances to the public. This may not be desirable depending on the use case and could pose privacy concerns.
3) Ether Leakage: There is a potential for ether leakage if the `withdraw` function fails after deducting the amount from the user's balance but before transferring the funds to the user. This can result in locked funds that cannot be retrieved by users.
4) Insufficient Gas: If the `withdraw` function requires more gas than the maximum amount allowable, users may not be able to withdraw their funds successfully, leading to a loss of funds.
