The contract to analyze:

contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public payee;
    address public arbitrator;
    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _payer, address _payee, address _arbitrator, uint _amount) {
        payer = _payer;
        payee = _payee;
        arbitrator = _arbitrator;
        amount = _amount;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == payer, "Only the payer can deposit funds");
        require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect deposit amount");
    }

    function release() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbitrator, "Only the arbitrator can release funds");
        payee.transfer(amount);
    }

    function refund() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbitrator, "Only the arbitrator can refund funds");
        payer.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract:
1) No check on whether the payer has enough balance to transfer the specified amount.
2) Lack of check to ensure that the amount in the deposit function is not negative.
3) Lack of check to prevent releasing the funds multiple times.
4) Lack of error handling for transfer functions.
5) Lack of visibility specifiers for functions to control access.
6) The arbitrator could potentially collude with one of the parties to release funds unfairly.
7) Lack of an atomicity check to ensure the state changes are consistent.

Thus, the potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract include: 
1) inconsistent state update
2) incorrect visibility/ownership 
3) atomicity violation.
