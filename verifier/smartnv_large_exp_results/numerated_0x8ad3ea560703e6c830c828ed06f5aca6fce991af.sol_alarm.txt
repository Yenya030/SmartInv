The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated directly in the "execute" function, which may lead to inconsistent states if multiple transactions attempt to update it simultaneously. Consider using a locking mechanism to prevent this vulnerability.

2) Atomicity violation: The update to "proposal.votedAmount" in the "execute" function is not an atomic operation, and it is susceptible to race conditions. This can lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities in the contract.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "votingToken" variable is declared internal, which means that it can be accessed by inheriting contracts. Consider making it private to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.

4) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may require a large amount of gas to execute, especially if the "votingToken" balance is significantly high. This can lead to out-of-gas exceptions and potential vulnerabilities in the contract.

5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to conflicts and inconsistencies in the contract. Consider implementing a system to generate unique IDs for each proposal to prevent this vulnerability.

6) Business logic flaw: The logic in the "endExecute" function may not align with the intended business requirements of the contract, leading to potential vulnerabilities or undesired outcomes. Conduct a thorough review of the business logic to ensure its correctness.

7) Ether leakage: There is a potential risk of ether leakage in the contract if proper checks and safeguards are not implemented to handle ether transfers securely. Consider adding checks and validations to prevent ether leakage vulnerabilities.
