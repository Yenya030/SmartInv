The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- 7) ID uniqueness violation: There appears to be no mechanism in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to errors or confusion in tracking and managing proposals.
- 13) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential gas limitations for executing functions, which could result in transactions failing due to insufficient gas.
