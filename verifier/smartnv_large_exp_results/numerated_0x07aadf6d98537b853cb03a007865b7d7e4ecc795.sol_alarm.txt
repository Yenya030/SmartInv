Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no indication of how this variable is used or tracked further in the contract. This inconsistency may lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract claims to implement the `IERC20` interface, but there are no functions or variables related to ERC20 token standard implementation. This inconsistency may indicate incorrect visibility or ownership of essential contract functions.
