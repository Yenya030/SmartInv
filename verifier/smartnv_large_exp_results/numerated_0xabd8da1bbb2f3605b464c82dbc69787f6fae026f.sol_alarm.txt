The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract, but it does not ensure that the balance isn't modified elsewhere in the contract, leading to inconsistent state.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for an integer overflow in the liquidate function if the multiplication of getPrice(), cAmount, and 80 results in a value greater than can be stored in a uint data type.

3) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function makes a comparison based on getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100 < dAmount, which may not accurately reflect the intended business logic.
