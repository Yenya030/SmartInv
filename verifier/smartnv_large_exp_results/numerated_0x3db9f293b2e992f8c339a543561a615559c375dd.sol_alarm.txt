Contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint256 vote;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");
        
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
        
        Voter storage delegateTo = voters[to];
        if (delegateTo.voted) {
            totalVotes += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint256 proposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");
        
        sender.vote = proposal;
        sender.voted = true;
        
        totalVotes += sender.weight;
    }

    function endVoting() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can end voting.");
        
        // Code to calculate winning proposal and take action.
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
