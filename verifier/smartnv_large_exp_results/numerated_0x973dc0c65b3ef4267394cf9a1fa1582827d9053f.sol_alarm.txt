Potential vulnerabilities:
7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of the escrow ID or transaction, which could lead to confusion or manipulation.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Both releaseFunds and refundFunds functions only check if the message sender is the arbiter, but there is no check to ensure that only the arbiter can call these functions, potentially leading to unauthorized access and misuse of funds.
