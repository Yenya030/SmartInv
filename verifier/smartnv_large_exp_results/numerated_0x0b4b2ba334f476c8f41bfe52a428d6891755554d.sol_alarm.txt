Contract to be analyzed:
contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter, uint _amount) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = _amount;
    }

    function releaseAmountToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can release funds");
        seller.transfer(amount);
    }

    function refundAmountToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund funds");
        buyer.transfer(amount);
    }
} 

Output:
The potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership for the releaseAmountToSeller and refundAmountToBuyer functions.
