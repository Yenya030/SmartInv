The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable "startingBlance" is misspelled as "startingBalance" in the function "startExecute", which may lead to unexpected behavior when updating the state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide implementations for all the required functions, which could lead to incorrect behavior or compilation errors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
