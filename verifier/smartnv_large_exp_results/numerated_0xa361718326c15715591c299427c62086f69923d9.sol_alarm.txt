Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without checking for existing proposals, leading to potential conflicting state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() may fail due to insufficient gas if the execution of the code consumes more gas than available.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of certain variables and functions are not specified, which may lead to unintended access control issues.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks mechanisms to ensure unique IDs for proposals, potentially leading to conflicts or unexpected behaviors.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, incorrect visibility/ownership, and ID uniqueness violation.
