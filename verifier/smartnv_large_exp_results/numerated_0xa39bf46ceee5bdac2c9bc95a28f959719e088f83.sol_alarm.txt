The potential vulnerabilities in the "PaymentContract" are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for an integer underflow in the "withdraw" function if the 'amount' parameter passed is greater than the balance in the 'balances' mapping.
2) Insufficient gas: If the 'withdraw' function requires more gas than available due to a large balance, it may result in the transaction failing.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is public, allowing anyone to view the owner's address.
