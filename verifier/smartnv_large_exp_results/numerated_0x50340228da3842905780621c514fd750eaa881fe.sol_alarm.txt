Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount of the proposal without using a proper synchronization mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple executions occur simultaneously.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may fail if it requires more gas than available in the transaction, potentially leaving the contract in an incomplete or inconsistent state.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not specified whether the owner variable is intended to be public or not, which could lead to potential issues related to visibility and ownership control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
