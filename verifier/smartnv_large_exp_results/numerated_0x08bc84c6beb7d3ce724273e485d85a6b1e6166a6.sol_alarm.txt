Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The `proposal` struct is being updated in the `startExecute`, `execute`, and `endExecute` functions. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled carefully.

2) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier, making it susceptible to ID duplication or overwriting.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not explicitly stated whether the `owner` variable should be private or not, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or unauthorized access.

It should be noted that the contract code provided is incomplete and lacks full context, which may impact the ability to identify all potential vulnerabilities accurately.
