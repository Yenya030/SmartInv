The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the struct Proposal which can potentially lead to issues in the contract. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The startExecute function is not marked as internal or external, which can affect the contract's accessibility and security.

3) Inconsistent state update: It seems the startingBalanceList is being updated in the startExecute function but is not defined in the contract, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are incorrect visibility/ownership and inconsistent state update.
