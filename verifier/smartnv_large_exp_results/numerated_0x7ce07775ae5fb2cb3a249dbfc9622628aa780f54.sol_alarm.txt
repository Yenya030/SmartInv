The contract provided for analysis:
contract TokenSale {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public tokenBalance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint amount) external {
        require(tokenBalance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough tokens");
        tokenBalance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        // Transfer tokens to buyer
    }

    function withdrawOwnerTokens() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw tokens");
        // Withdraw tokens to owner
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the TokenSale contract are:
1) Privilege Escalation
2) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership
