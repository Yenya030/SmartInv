The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract allows for a state update in the `execute` function without ensuring that all necessary conditions are met before updating the state, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function might fail if the gas limit is not sufficient to complete the required operations, leading to potential issues.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of variables like `owner`, which might lead to unintended access or modifications by external entities.
