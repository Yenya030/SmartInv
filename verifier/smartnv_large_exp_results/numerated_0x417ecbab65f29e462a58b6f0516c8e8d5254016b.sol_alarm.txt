The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;

    enum State {AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE, REFUNDED}
    State public currentState;

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor(address _buyer, address _seller, address _arbiter) {
        buyer = _buyer;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        currentState = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "Only buyer or seller can deposit funds.");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can release funds.");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Funds cannot be released before delivery.");
        balances[seller] += balances[buyer];
        balances[buyer] = 0;
        currentState = State.COMPLETE;
    }

    function refundFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == seller || msg.sender == arbiter, "Only seller or arbiter can refund funds.");
        require(currentState == State.AWAITING_DELIVERY, "Funds cannot be refunded before delivery.");
        balances[buyer] += balances[buyer];
        balances[buyer] = 0;
        currentState = State.REFUNDED;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
