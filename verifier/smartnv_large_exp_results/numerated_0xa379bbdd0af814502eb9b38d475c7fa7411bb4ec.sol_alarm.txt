The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the total balance of the contract's token is more than twice the total token supply. This logic seems incorrect and may lead to unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` field of the `Proposal` struct directly, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal concurrently.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw and inconsistent state update.
