The contract to analyze:

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint id;
        bool hasVoted;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        require(!voters[msg.sender].hasVoted, "Voter has already voted.");
        voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = true;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function resetVotes() public {
        totalVotes = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalVotes; i++) {
            voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = false;
        }
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not assign a unique ID to each voter, which could lead to a violation of ID uniqueness.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `voters` mapping is public, potentially exposing sensitive information about voters.
10) Arithmetic flaw: In the `resetVotes` function, the loop condition `i < totalVotes` should be `i < totalVotes` instead to properly iterate over voter counts.
13) Insufficient gas: The `resetVotes` function permanently locks up the contract by setting `totalVotes = 0` without resetting individual voter's `hasVoted` status, causing potential gas exhaustion.
