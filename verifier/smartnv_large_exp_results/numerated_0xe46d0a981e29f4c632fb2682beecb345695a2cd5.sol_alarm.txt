The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `votedAmount` in the `execute` function is directly updated without considering reentrancy issues, which may lead to inconsistent data.
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function performs multiple state changes without ensuring that all changes are executed atomically, which may result in partial execution of the function.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to gas limitations when calculating the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")`, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and insufficient gas.
