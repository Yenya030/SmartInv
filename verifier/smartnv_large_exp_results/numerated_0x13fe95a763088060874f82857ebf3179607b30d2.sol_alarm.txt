Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct directly, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership and visibility of the functions in the contract are not specified, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition where the balance of the contract multiplied by 2 is greater than the total token supply, which could potentially lead to running out of gas during execution, especially if the token supply is very large.
