Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to only authorized users, potentially allowing unauthorized access to privileged functions.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of the proposal without properly checking for conditions where this value could be manipulated or inconsistent.
3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are no checks for potential integer overflows or underflows in the arithmetic calculations within the contract, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables and functions in the contract is not specified, which could lead to unintentional access or manipulation of contract state by external actors.
