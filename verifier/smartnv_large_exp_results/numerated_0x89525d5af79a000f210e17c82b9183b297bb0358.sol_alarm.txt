The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function updates the state variable `proposal.votedAmount` without proper concurrency control mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are not explicitly defined with visibility modifiers, leaving them accessible to external contracts which may pose a security risk.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may run out of gas if the `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply())` condition is not met, potentially leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
