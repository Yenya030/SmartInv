The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities of:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the proposal state without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute() function performs a calculation (require statement) based on the totalSupply of a token, which may consume a large amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors.

3) Possible ID uniqueness violation: There are no checks in place to ensure that the proposals are unique, which may lead to conflicts or unintended behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and possible ID uniqueness violation.
