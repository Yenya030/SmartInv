The contract being analyzed is as follows:

contract SupplyChain {
    struct Product {
        uint256 productId;
        address owner;
        uint256 price;
        bool isSold;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Product) public products;
    
    function createProduct(uint256 _productId, uint256 _price) public {
        Product memory newProduct = Product(_productId, msg.sender, _price, false);
        products[_productId] = newProduct;
    }
    
    function buyProduct(uint256 _productId) public {
        Product storage product = products[_productId];
        require(product.isSold == false, "Product is already sold");
        
        product.isSold = true;
        address seller = product.owner;
        uint256 price = product.price;
        seller.transfer(price);
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `products` mapping can be accessed directly from outside the contract, which may expose sensitive information.

2) Insufficient gas: If the function `buyProduct` is used to transfer funds to multiple users, there might be an issue of insufficient gas leading to transaction failures.

3) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `isSold` is being updated directly within the `buyProduct` function, which can lead to inconsistent state if multiple users try to buy the same product simultaneously.

4) Ether leakage: Transferring Ether to the `seller` using `seller.transfer(price)` can lead to Ether leakage if the transfer fails midway, leaving the seller with an inconsistent state.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the Contract are: 
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- Inconsistent state update
- Ether leakage
