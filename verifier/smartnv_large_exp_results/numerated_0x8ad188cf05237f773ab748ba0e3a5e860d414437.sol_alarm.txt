The following contract may have potential vulnerabilities:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can call certain functions, potentially allowing unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.

2) Inconsistent state update: The use of a global proposal struct without proper management of its state changes may lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in the contract state.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving arithmetic calculations without proper checks for potential overflows or underflows, which can result in unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of the contract and its functions are not clearly defined, which may lead to security vulnerabilities related to access control and ownership.

Therefore, the contract may have vulnerabilities related to privilege escalation, inconsistent state updates, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
