The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: In function endExecute(), the update of the lockedFunds variable occurs before the final condition check which could result in incorrect state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the liquidate and calculatePrice functions is set to public which may expose sensitive operations to unintended users.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
