The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() does not reset the proposal fields after execution, potentially leading to inconsistencies if the same proposal is executed multiple times.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the TimelockController contract is not explicitly defined, making it susceptible to unauthorized access and changes by external entities.
