Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Business logic flaw: The contract does not have checks to prevent the buyer or seller from calling both confirmItemReceived() and releasePayment().
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: Both confirmItemReceived() and releasePayment() functions are public, allowing anyone to call these functions. These functions should be restricted to only the intended parties (buyer and seller).
