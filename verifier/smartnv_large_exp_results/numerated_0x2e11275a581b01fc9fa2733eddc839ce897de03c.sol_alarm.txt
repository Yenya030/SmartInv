The contract in question:

contract Crowdsale {
    address public owner;
    address public tokenAddress;
    uint public tokenPrice;

    constructor(address _tokenAddress, uint _tokenPrice) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
        tokenPrice = _tokenPrice;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _tokenAmount) public payable {
        uint totalPrice = _tokenAmount * tokenPrice;
        require(msg.value >= totalPrice, "Insufficient funds");

        // Transfer tokens to buyer
        ERC20(tokenAddress).transfer(msg.sender, _tokenAmount);

        // Send ether to owner
        owner.transfer(totalPrice);
    }
}

Output: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The token transfer and ether transfer need to be performed atomically to avoid inconsistent state issues.
2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include gas stipend for ether transfers, which may lead to out of gas errors during execution.
