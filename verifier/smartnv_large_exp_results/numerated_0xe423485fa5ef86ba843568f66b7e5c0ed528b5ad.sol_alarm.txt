This contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) integer overflow/underflow: 
   - In the function "endExecute()", the comparison "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()" may result in an integer overflow if the multiplication of the balance is too large.

2) inconsistent state update:
   - In the function "execute()", the statement "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" updates the state variable without taking into consideration potential reentrancy issues, leading to inconsistent state updates.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership:
   - The contract does not specify the visibility of the state variables "owner" and "votingToken", which could result in unintended access or modification by external contracts.

Overall, the contract has vulnerabilities that need to be addressed for improved security.
