Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Privilege escalation: The contract does not implement access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users only.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function does not update the proposal state consistently, potentially leading to incorrect data representation.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level.
4) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may run out of gas if the balance of the contract is too high, leading to a failed execution.
5) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential risk of inconsistent data between different token pairs (WETH, USDC) in the contract.
