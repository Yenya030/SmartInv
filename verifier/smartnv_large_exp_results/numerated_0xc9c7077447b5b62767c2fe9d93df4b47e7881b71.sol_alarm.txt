The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the state of `proposal`, `startingBlance`, and `startingBalanceList`, but it is not clear if these updates are done atomically or if there could be inconsistent state updates.

2) Atomicity violation: The state variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `proposal` are updated independently in the function `execute`, which could lead to atomicity violations.

3) Reentrancy: The `execute` function interacts with an external contract (`votingToken`) and then calls `votedProposal(proposal)`, potentially allowing for reentrancy attacks.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract `TimelockController` claims to implement the interface `IERC20`, but the actual implementation is not provided in the code snippet, potentially leading to incorrect visibility or ownership issues. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- inconsistent state update
- atomicity violation
- reentrancy
- incorrect visibility/ownership.
