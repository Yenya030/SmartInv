The contract in question contains the following potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute()" updates the state of the proposal without initializing the struct "proposal". This can lead to inconsistent data and unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface IERC20 but does not provide the required functions like "transfer" and "balanceOf". This can lead to issues related to incorrect visibility and ownership of functions and data.
