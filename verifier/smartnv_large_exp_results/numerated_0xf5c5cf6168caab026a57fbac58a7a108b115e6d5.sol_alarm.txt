Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals or other entities, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of certain functions and variables is not explicitly specified, which could lead to unintentional access or manipulation by external parties.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility that certain functions or operations within the contract may require more gas than provided, leading to failed transactions or incomplete executions.

Overall assessment: the contract contains potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed to ensure security and reliability.
