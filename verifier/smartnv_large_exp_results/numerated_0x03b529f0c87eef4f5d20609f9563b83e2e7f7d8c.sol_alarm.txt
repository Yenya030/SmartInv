Contract to analyze:

contract Lottery {
     address public owner;
     uint public balance;
     uint public ticketPrice;
     mapping(address => uint) public ticketsBought;

     constructor(uint _ticketPrice) public {
           owner = msg.sender;
           ticketPrice = _ticketPrice;
      }

     function buyTickets(uint _numTickets) public payable {
           require(msg.value == _numTickets * ticketPrice, "Incorrect amount sent");
           ticketsBought[msg.sender] += _numTickets;
           balance += msg.value;
      }

     function selectWinner() public {
           require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can select a winner");
           uint winner = getRandomNumber() % ticketsBought.length;
           address winningAddress;
           // logic to determine winning address
           balance = 0;
           // transfer balance to winning address
      }

     function getRandomNumber() private view returns (uint) {
           return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp))) % 100;
      }
}

Output:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership
