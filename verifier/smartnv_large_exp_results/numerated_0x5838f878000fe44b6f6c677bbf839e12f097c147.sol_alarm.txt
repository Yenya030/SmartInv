The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "endExecute()" updates the state variable "lockedFunds" based on the balance of the contract, but it does not consider potential re-entrancy attacks or other external calls that could affect the balance, leading to an inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify explicit visibility (public, external, internal, private) for the variables and functions, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation of contract data.

3) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not handle ensuring uniqueness of proposal IDs, which can lead to potential conflicts or unexpected behavior when multiple proposals are created.

4) Reentrancy: The functions in the contract interact with external contracts without considering re-entrancy protection, which can make the contract vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle potential out-of-gas exceptions or failures during state changes, which can lead to incomplete or incorrect execution of functions.
