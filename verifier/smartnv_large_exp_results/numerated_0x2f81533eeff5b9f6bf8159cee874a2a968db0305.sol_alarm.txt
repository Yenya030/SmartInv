Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility: The functions `calculatePrice()` and `liquidate()` are both marked as public which means they can be called by anyone. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the contract state by external actors.
2) Business logic flaw: The `liquidate()` function checks if the debt amount is less than 80% of the collateral amount, which could potentially lead to incorrect liquidation calculations and result in loss of funds.
