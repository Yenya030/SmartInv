The contract to be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(uint => uint) public payments;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function processPayment(uint _paymentId, uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can process payments");
        
        payments[_paymentId] = _amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint _paymentId) public {
        require(payments[_paymentId] > 0, "No funds to withdraw");

        uint amount = payments[_paymentId];
        payments[_paymentId] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Output: 
- privilege escalation
- inconsistent state update
