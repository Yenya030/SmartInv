Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without any condition or check, potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: There is a lack of explicit visibility modifiers for the state variables `owner` and `votingToken`, opening them up to potential unauthorized access or manipulation.
