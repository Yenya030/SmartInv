Potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

- Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without resetting `proposal.sTime`, which could lead to inconsistent state.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is public, exposing sensitive information, and the `lockedFunds` variable is not defined or initialized in the contract.
