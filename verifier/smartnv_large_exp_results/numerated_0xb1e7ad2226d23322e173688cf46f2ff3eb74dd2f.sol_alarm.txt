Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` and `startingBalanceList` variables are not properly defined with any visibility specifier, which can lead to potential issues with accessing or modifying them.
2) inconsistent state update: The `proposal` state is updated in multiple functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) without ensuring proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.
3) insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if the execution has ended and if the balance of the contract is sufficient, but it does not consider the gas cost of the operations, which can lead to the function failing if there is insufficient gas.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function is called without specifying how proposals are uniquely identified, which can lead to potential confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals exist simultaneously.
