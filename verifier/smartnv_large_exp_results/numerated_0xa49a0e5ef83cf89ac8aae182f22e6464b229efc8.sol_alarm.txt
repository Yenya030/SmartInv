Contract Analysis:

The contract has the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The proposal ID is not generated with uniqueness in mind, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is internal, which may not be the intended access level for the owner.
3) Inconsistent state update: The votedAmount field in the Proposal struct is directly incremented, which could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior.
4) Business logic flaw: The implementation of the endExecute function may have a flaw as the condition for execution success (require statement) may not accurately reflect the intended logic.
