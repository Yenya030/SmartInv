The contract provided is:

```
contract SmartContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        balance = 0;
    }

    function deposit(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can deposit");
        balance += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the SmartContract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which exposes the owner address to everyone. It should be made private.
2) Privilege escalation: The deposit and withdraw functions only check if the caller is the owner, which could potentially allow unauthorized access to the contract's functions.
3) Inconsistent state update: The `balance` variable is not updated atomically, which could lead to inconsistent state if multiple transactions modify the balance concurrently.
4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not specify a gas limit for transactions, which could result in transactions running out of gas and reverting unexpectedly.
