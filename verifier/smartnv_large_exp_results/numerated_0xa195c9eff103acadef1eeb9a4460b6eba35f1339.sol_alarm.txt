The contract in question may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility modifiers for its functions, making them potentially accessible from external contracts or accounts. 
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, `startingBlance` is misspelled, which might lead to unintended behavior. 
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, which might not be the intended visibility level. 
4) Insufficient gas: Since the contract interacts with other contracts (such as `votingToken`), there might be a risk of running out of gas during function execution.

Overall, the contract could benefit from a thorough review to address these potential vulnerabilities.
