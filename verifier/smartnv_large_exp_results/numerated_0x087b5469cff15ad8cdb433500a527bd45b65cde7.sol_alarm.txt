The contract you provided:
Contract XYZ {
         IERC20 public token;
         uint public totalSupply;

         function buyTokens(uint amount) public {
             require(token.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient token balance");
             totalSupply += amount;
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
         }

         function sellTokens(uint amount) public {
             require(totalSupply >= amount, "Insufficient total token supply");
             totalSupply -= amount;
             token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The totalSupply is updated without considering the possibility of overflow/underflow, leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The token variable is set to public, which may expose sensitive information about the token contract.
3) Insufficient gas: The contract does not include any gas-related checks or safeguards, which could result in transaction failures due to insufficient gas.
