The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without properly resetting the Proposal struct or any other relevant state variables. This could lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for controlling ownership of the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: The execution of functions like `execute` and `endExecute` involves multiple operations and interactions (e.g., transferFrom). If the gas limit provided is insufficient, these operations may fail midway, leading to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
