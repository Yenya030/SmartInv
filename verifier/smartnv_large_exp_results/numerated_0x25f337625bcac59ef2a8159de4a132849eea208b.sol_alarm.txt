Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner state variable is currently set to internal, which may not be the intended behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The 'votedAmount' state variable is being updated directly in the execute function. This could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple executions are run concurrently.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of the endExecute function, as the gas required for the execution is not explicitly managed.
4) Possible Reentrancy: The execute function is transferring tokens before updating the votedAmount state variable and calling the votedProposal function, which may lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities.
5) ID uniqueness violation: There is no uniqueness check for proposals, which could lead to conflicts if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.
