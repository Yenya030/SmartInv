The contract provided is analyzed below for potential vulnerabilities:

- ID uniqueness violation: There is no explicit code in the contract that enforces unique identifiers for entities like proposals or users. This could potentially lead to conflicts or inconsistencies in data handling.
- Atomicity violation: The `execute` function increments `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to race conditions and inconsistent state updates.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal` which could prevent external contracts from interacting with it, potentially limiting functionalities or access.
- Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function doesn't specify any gas stipend for potential operations like transferring tokens, which could lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, atomicity violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
