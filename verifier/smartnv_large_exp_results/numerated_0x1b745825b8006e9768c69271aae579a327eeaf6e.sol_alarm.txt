Output:
- Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The state variables payer, recipient, arbiter, amount are public, exposing sensitive information. Consider using private or internal visibility for these variables. 
- Privilege Escalation: The releaseAmount function can be called by the arbiter, enabling potential privilege escalation if the arbiter is not the intended party to release the amount. 
- Business Logic Flaw: The releaseAmount function does not check for the amount being approved, allowing the release of funds without both parties approving.
