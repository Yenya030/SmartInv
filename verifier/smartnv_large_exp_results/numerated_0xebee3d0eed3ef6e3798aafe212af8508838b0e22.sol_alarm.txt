The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided could be:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
2) inconsistent state update: There are multiple state variables being updated within functions without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent data.
3) atomicity violation: There are operations within functions that are not executed atomically, which could result in unexpected behavior if interrupted.
4) integer overflow/underflow: The contract performs arithmetic operations without checking for potential overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected results.
5) ether leakage: There is a lack of checks to prevent unintentional loss of Ether within the contract.
6) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and state variables is not properly defined, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation of data.
