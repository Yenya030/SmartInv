Contract to analyze:
contract PaymentContract {
        mapping(address => uint) public balances;

        function deposit() public payable {
            balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        }

        function withdraw(uint amount) public {
            require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
            balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
            msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        }
} 

Potential vulnerabilities:
1) integer overflow/underflow: The balances are stored as uint which can potentially lead to integer overflow if the balances exceed the maximum value that uint can hold.
2) insufficient gas: The withdraw function performs a transfer, which can fail if the gas limit is exceeded, leading to incomplete withdrawals.
3) Ether leakage: If the transfer in the withdraw function fails, it can result in Ether being stuck in the contract, leading to potential Ether leakage.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The balances mapping is public, which exposes sensitive balance information publicly. It might be better to use internal or private visibility for the balances mapping to restrict access.
