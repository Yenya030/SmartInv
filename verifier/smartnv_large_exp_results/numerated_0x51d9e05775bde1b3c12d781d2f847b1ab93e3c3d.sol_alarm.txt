Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract: 
1) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the variables `proposal` and `startingBalanceList`, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
2) inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function does not reset the `proposal` state after execution, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) atomicity violation: The `execute` function allows for multiple executions of the same proposal without proper atomicity checks, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
4) insufficient gas: The `calculatePrice` function calculates the price and returns it without specifying the gas cost, which can lead to insufficient gas issues. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and insufficient gas.
