Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function in the TimelockController contract updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct directly, but there is no check to prevent multiple calls to this function resulting in inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The TimelockController contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not contain the necessary ERC20 functions like transfer. This could lead to issues with the ownership and visibility of the contract's functions.
