The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of `votedProposal(proposal)` function, which can lead to potential issues with contract ownership and visibility.

2) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables that are updated in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`), which may lead to inconsistent state updates or unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function checks if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` but does not handle the potential scenario where the gas may run out during execution, leading to incomplete execution of the function.

Overall Assessment: This contract contains potential vulnerabilities that could lead to inconsistent state updates, ownership visibility issues, and insufficient gas handling.
