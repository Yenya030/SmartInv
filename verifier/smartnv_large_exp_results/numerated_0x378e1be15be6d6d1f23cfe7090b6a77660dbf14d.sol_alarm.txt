The contract to analyze:
<\contract_to_analyze\>
contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;
    uint public totalVotes;
    
    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
        totalVotes++;
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
    
    function getTotalVotes() public view returns (uint) {
        return totalVotes;
    }

    function resetVotes() public {
        totalVotes = 0;
    }
}
<\contract_to_analyze\> 

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) ID uniqueness violation (multiple votes from the same address can be cast).
2) Inconsistent state update (resetting votes without proper verification).
3) Insufficient gas (potential gas limit issues due to increasing totalVotes without limit).
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership (public access to hasVoted mapping could pose a security risk).
