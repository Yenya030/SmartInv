The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract TokenSale {
    IERC20 public token;
    address public owner;
    uint public price;

    constructor(IERC20 _token, uint _price) public {
        token = _token;
        owner = msg.sender;
        price = _price;
    }

    function buyTokens(uint _amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == _amount * price, "Incorrect payment amount");
        token.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized withdrawal");
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

Output: 
The potential vulnerabilities present in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `withdraw` function should have more strict visibility and access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
