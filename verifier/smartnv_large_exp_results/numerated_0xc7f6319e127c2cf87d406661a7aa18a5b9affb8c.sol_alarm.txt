Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() updates the state variables proposal and startingBalanceList without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent data.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is declaring that it implements the interface IERC20, but it does not actually include the required functions from the interface, which may lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with other contracts that expect the interface to be implemented correctly.
