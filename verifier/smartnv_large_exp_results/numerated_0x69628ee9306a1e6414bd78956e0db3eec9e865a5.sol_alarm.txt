The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any proper synchronization mechanisms which could lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update it concurrently.

2) Insufficient gas: The `liquidate` function in the `ExchangeTokens` contract interacts with external contracts (USDC and WETH) which may require more gas than the default gas stipend provided by Ethereum for certain operations. This could result in out-of-gas errors during execution.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Inconsistent state update and Insufficient gas.
