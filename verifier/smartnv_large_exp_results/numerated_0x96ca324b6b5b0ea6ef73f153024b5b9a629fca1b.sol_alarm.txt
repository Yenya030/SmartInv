Given contract:

contract Marketplace {
         IERC20 public token;
         mapping(address => uint) public balances;
         
         function deposit(uint amount) public {
             token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
             balances[msg.sender] += amount;
         }
         
         function withdraw(uint amount) public {
             require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
             balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
             token.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
         }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `balances` mapping is public, meaning that anyone can view the balances of any address. This might not be intended and could lead to privacy concerns.
- Insufficient gas: If the `withdraw` function is called with a very large `amount` that causes the gas cost to exceed the gas limit, the transaction will fail. It might be recommended to use a withdrawal pattern or batch withdrawals to handle large amounts more efficiently and prevent gas issues.
