The contract to analyze for potential vulnerabilities is:

contract Purchase {
     address public seller;
     address public buyer;
     uint public price;

     function setPrice(uint _price) public {
         require(msg.sender == seller, "only seller can set the price");
         price = _price;
     }

     function buy() public {
         require(msg.sender == buyer, "only buyer can buy");
         require(msg.value == price, "incorrect amount sent");
         seller.transfer(msg.value);
     }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the Purchase contract are:
1) incorrect visibility/ownership for the setPrice function as it only checks if the caller is the seller without checking for ownership verification.
2) reentrancy vulnerability in the buy function as it allows the buyer to call another external function after sending the funds which opens up to potential reentrancy attacks.
