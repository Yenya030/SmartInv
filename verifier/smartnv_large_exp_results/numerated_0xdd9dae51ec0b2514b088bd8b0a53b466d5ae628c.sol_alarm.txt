Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation: the contract does not have any access control mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized users from executing certain functions.
2) arithmetic flaw: there are potentially risky arithmetic operations in the liquidate function that could lead to unexpected outcomes due to integer overflow/underflow.
