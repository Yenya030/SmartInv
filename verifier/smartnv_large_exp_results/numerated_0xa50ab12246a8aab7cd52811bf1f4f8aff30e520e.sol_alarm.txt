Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
5) Atomicity violation: The functions startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() modify the state of the proposal struct independently without atomicity, potentially leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the IERC20 interface but does not properly define the functions required by the interface. The visibility of the functions is also missing, which could lead to unexpected access control issues.
