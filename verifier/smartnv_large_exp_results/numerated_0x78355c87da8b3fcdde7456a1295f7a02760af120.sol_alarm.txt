The contract to analyze:
```solidity
contract Lottery {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalTickets;
    mapping(address => uint) public tickets;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        totalTickets = 0;
    }

    function buyTicket() public payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether, "Insufficient value to buy a ticket");
        totalTickets++;
        tickets[msg.sender]++;
    }

    function drawWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can draw the winner");
        uint winner = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % totalTickets;
        address winnerAddress;
        for (uint i = 0; i < totalTickets; i++) {
            if (tickets[address(i)] > 0) {
                if (winner == 0) {
                    winnerAddress = address(i);
                    break;
                } else {
                    winner--;
                }
            }
        }
        payable(winnerAddress).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function withdrawFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds");
        payable(owner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Privilege escalation as only the owner can draw the winner and withdraw funds.
2) Lack of ID uniqueness violation as the tickets are tracked by the user's address, which may not guarantee uniqueness.
3) Inconsistent state update as the winner selection logic may result in unexpected behavior.
4) Insufficient gas as transferring funds in drawWinner() function may fail if the gas limit is exceeded.
