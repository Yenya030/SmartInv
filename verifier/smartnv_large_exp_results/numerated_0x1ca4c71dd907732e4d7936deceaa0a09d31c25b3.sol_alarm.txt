Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

1) Insufficient gas: The contract does not account for potential gas limitations in contract execution, which could lead to transactions failing due to running out of gas.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access and manipulation of the contract state.
