Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not seem to have any mechanisms to ensure unique IDs for proposals or voting tokens, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: In the `startExecute` function, `startingBlance` is misspelled as `startingBalance`, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables are not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical functions or data.
