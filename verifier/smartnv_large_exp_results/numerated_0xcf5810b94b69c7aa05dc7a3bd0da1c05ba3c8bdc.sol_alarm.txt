The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute()` function modifies the state of the `proposal` variable without utilizing proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent states.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may run out of gas due to the computation-intensive operations it performs, such as checking the balance of the token contract and the total token supply.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` variable, which can lead to potential issues in accessing or modifying its state by external contracts.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
