Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute() sets the starting balance for a proposal, but it doesn't update the state variable startingBlanceList, which could lead to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for this variable.
3) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() performs a potentially expensive operation by checking if the locked funds are more than half of the total token supply, which could run out of gas and result in the transaction failing.
