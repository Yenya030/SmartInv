The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, which could lead to inconsistent state updates if the balance changes unexpectedly.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the functions and variables, leaving them potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access or manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: The execution of the `endExecute()` function could run out of gas if there is a large number of token holders, as it iterates through all of them to calculate the balance.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
