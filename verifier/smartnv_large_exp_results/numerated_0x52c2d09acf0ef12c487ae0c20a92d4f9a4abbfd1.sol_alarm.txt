The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Integer overflow/underflow in functions "endExecute()" where the calculation of "votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2" may lead to overflow.
2) Inconsistent state update in function "startExecute()" where the "startingBalanceList[proposal.addr]" is updated without initializing it, leading to inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership in the contract as the contract does not explicitly define visibility for functions and variables, potentially leading to security issues.
