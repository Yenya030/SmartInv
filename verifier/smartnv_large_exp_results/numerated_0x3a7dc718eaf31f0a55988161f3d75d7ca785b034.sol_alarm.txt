contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        votes[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function revokeVote() public {
           require(votes[msg.sender] > 0, "no vote to revoke");

}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update - The totalVotes variable is incremented without considering the possibility of votes[msg.sender] being already incremented, leading to a potential inconsistency in the totalVotes count.
