<strong>Potential vulnerabilities:</strong>
14) incorrect visibility/ownership - The balances mapping is public, which exposes all user balances to anyone who interacts with the contract. This can potentially leak sensitive information. 

It seems like the contract is well-written and doesn't have severe vulnerabilities.
