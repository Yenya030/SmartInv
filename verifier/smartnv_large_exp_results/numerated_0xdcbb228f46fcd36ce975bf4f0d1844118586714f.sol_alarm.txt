The contract analyzed: 

contract Vesting {
    address public beneficiary;
    uint public start;
    uint public cliff;
    uint public duration;
    uint public vested;
    bool public revocable;

    modifier onlyBeneficiary {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Not beneficiary");
        _;
    }

    function revoke() public onlyBeneficiary {
        require(revocable, "Not revocable");
        // Code to revoke vested tokens
    }

    function release() public onlyBeneficiary {
        require(block.timestamp >= start + cliff, "Cliff period has not passed");
        // Code to release vested tokens
    }
}

Output:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'revoke' function allows the beneficiary to revoke vested tokens, but there is no actual implementation code to revoke the tokens. This leaves the contract in an inconsistent state where revocation is theoretically possible but not actually executed.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'onlyBeneficiary' modifier is used to restrict access to beneficiary only. However, the 'release' function also uses this modifier, which may not be intended as it should allow the beneficiary to release vested tokens, not just the beneficiary themselves.

3) Suicidal contracts: There is potential vulnerability for a contract to call selfdestruct() function which may lead to destroying the contract and funds stored in it.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership
3) Suicidal contracts
