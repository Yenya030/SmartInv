The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

6) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract has interactions between different tokens (WETH, USDC) and the Uniswap pair without proper validation, which can lead to inconsistencies in the bridge between them.

7) ID uniqueness violation: There doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to ensure unique IDs for different users, which can lead to potential conflicts and security risks.

14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions in the contract may not be properly defined, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and risks.
