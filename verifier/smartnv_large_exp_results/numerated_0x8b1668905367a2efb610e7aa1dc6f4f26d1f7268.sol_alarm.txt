The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount" is updated in the "execute" function, but there is no check to ensure that the same proposal is being executed. This can lead to inappropriate state changes.

2) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function may require excessive gas to execute if the condition checking for execution failure has a high cost, potentially leading to out-of-gas errors.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the "lockedFunds" variable is not specified, potentially exposing sensitive information publicly. Additionally, the ownership control mechanism is not clearly defined in the contract.
