The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not declared in the contract, raising concerns about data visibility and ownership.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` line in the `execute` function may lead to inconsistent state updates due to the lack of proper synchronization mechanisms.
3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may fail due to insufficient gas if the gas limit is reached while executing the required operations.
