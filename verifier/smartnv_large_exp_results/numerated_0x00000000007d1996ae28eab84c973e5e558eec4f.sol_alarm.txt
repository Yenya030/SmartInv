The potential vulnerabilities in the contract to be analyzed are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract seems to have state variables that are updated at different stages without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistencies.
2) Insufficient gas: The contract may not handle gas properly, leading to potential out-of-gas errors during execution.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of functions and variables in the contract may not be properly set, potentially leading to unauthorized access or changes.
