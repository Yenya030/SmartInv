Based on the provided contract, potential vulnerabilities include:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- The contract uses the "proposal" struct to handle proposals, but there is no clear indication of the initial state or proper handling of state updates throughout the execution of proposals. 

2) Insufficient gas: 
- The contract may encounter out-of-gas exceptions during the execution of functions that involve transferring tokens, as there is no guarantee of sufficient gas provided for these operations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- The contract does not explicitly define the visibility or ownership requirements for functions and variables, leaving potential risks of improper access control.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state updates, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
