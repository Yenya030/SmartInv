The contract to analyze is:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        votes[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function withdrawVotes() public {
        uint voteAmount = votes[msg.sender];
        require(voteAmount > 0, "No votes to withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(voteAmount);
        votes[msg.sender] = 0;
        totalVotes -= voteAmount;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities:
12) Ether leakage: The 'withdrawVotes' function directly transfers Ether to the caller without verifying the potential consequences of transferring Ether.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'votes' mapping and 'totalVotes' variable are public, allowing anyone to view and modify the voting data.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are ether leakage and incorrect visibility/ownership.
