Based on the provided code snippet, potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` updates the `proposal` state without checking if it's eligible for a new proposal, potentially leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not declared with any visibility specifier, making it publicly accessible and modifiable, which could lead to unauthorized changes or exploitation.
