The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in the contract ExchangeTokens updates the debt and collateral mappings without any proper check, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The function liquidate in the contract ExchangeTokens uses arithmetic operations without proper overflow/underflow checks, which could result in arithmetic flaws.

3) Price manipulation: The function calculatePrice in the contract ExchangeTokens may be subject to price manipulation if the external contract balances can be manipulated.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, arithmetic flaw, and price manipulation.
