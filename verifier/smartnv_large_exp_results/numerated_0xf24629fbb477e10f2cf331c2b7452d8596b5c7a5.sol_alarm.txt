Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` is updating the `lockedFunds` variable without any verification or authorization, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a risk of integer overflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` in the `liquidate` function, which may result in unexpected behavior.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable is not specified, which may lead to unintended access or modifications by external contracts.

4) Insufficient gas: If the gas limit is not properly managed, certain functions in the contract may run out of gas during execution, causing unexpected halts or failures.
