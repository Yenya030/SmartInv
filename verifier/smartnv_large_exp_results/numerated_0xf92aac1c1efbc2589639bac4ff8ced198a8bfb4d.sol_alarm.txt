Vulnerabilities:
2) Privilege escalation: There is no access control mechanism specified to restrict who can call the functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute. This could lead to unauthorized individuals manipulating the proposals.

Vulnerabilities:
1) Price manipulation: The liquidate function does not perform proper validation or checks on the price calculation, making it possible for attackers to manipulate the price and carry out undesired liquidations.
6) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is a potential inconsistency between the calculation in the liquidate function and the getPrice function, leading to inconsistencies in the token exchange process.

Overall, the contracts contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
