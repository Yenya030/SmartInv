The contract contains potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The 'proposal.votedAmount' is updated directly in the 'execute' function without considering potential reentrancy issues.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The function 'votedProposal(proposal)' appears to be a private function, but it is not explicitly declared as such, which could lead to unintended external access.

Overall, the contract has potential vulnerabilities that may need to be addressed.
