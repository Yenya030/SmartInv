Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute` function without any checks or validations, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Arithmetic flaw: In the `endExecute` function, the comparison `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` could result in an arithmetic flaw if the values involved are not handled correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: The operations performed in the `endExecute` function, especially the potentially expensive `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` comparison, could consume a large amount of gas and potentially result in insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.
