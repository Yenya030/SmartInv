The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is directly updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization or checking, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the interface `IERC20` but doesn't define the required functions. This might lead to incorrect visibility and ownership issues in the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function has a potentially heavy operation of checking if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which might require significant gas to execute and could result in out of gas errors.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
