The contract being analyzed is:

```solidity
contract SimpleContract {
    address public owner;

    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can change the owner");
        owner = _newOwner;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation
2) incorrect visibility/ownership
