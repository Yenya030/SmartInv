The contract includes potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any ownership or visibility modifiers for its functions, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of its internal state.
2) Insufficient gas: The function endExecute() might fail if the gas limit is exceeded during the execution of the require statement, potentially causing the function to revert unexpectedly.
3) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct without using the SafeMath library, which could lead to integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.
4) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the liquidate() function might lead to arithmetic flaws if the values of getPrice() * cAmount * 80 or dAmount overflow the uint datatype.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions, leaving it vulnerable to Ether leakage if unintended transfers occur.
