The contract to analyze:

contract Account {
    address public owner;
    uint public balance;

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0");
        balance += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount > 0, "Withdraw amount must be greater than 0");
        require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) atomicity violation
2) integer overflow/underflow
3) insufficient gas
