The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The contract doesn't specify the visibility of the functions, making them publicly accessible.
2) Inconsistent state update - The function `execute` updates the state of the `proposal` without proper validation, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas - The `endExecute` function performs a gas-intensive operation, which could lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) Integer overflow/underflow - The variables `proposal.votedAmount` and `votingToken.totalSupply()` could potentially result in integer overflow if not handled properly.
