Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (misses specifying visibility for `votingToken` in `TimelockController`)
- Inconsistent state update (potentially conflicting or inconsistent updates to `proposal` variable in `TimelockController`)
- Insufficient gas (gas estimation for token transfers in `execute` function in `TimelockController`)
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (potential visibility for `getPrice` function in `ExchangeTokens`)
