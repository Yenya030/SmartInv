Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility/ownership of functions and variables, which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation by external entities.
- Inconsistent state update: The 'endExecute' function updates the 'lockedFunds' variable without checking for any conditions related to the proposal or other variables, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Atomicity violation: The 'execute' function involves multiple state changes without wrapping them in a single transaction, which can result in partial execution and unexpected outcomes.
- Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve uint variables, which may be susceptible to integer overflow or underflow if not handled properly.
