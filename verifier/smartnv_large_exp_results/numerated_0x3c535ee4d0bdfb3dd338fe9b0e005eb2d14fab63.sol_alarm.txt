The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: There is an issue with visibility as the `proposed` struct is not defined anywhere in the contract.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function, but it is not clear how it is being used or if it could lead to inconsistent state.
3) Business logic flaw: There might be a business logic flaw related to the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")` in the `endExecute` function.
4) Privilege escalation: The ownership control within the contract is not clearly defined, leaving potential for privilege escalation attacks.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: Incorrect visibility/ownership, inconsistent state update, business logic flaw, and privilege escalation.
