<\example_1\> 
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Inconsistent state update in the function `execute` as the `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented without proper synchronization.
- Potential reentrancy vulnerability in the `execute` function where `votingToken.transferFrom` should be called before updating `proposal.votedAmount`.
- Incorrect ID uniqueness violation as `proposal` is not stored in any mapping or structure to ensure uniqueness.

<\example_2\> 
Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Price manipulation vulnerability in the `liquidate` function where the calculation of liquidation amount can be manipulated by an attacker.
- Arithmetic flaw in the liquidation amount calculation can result in incorrect liquidation of funds.
