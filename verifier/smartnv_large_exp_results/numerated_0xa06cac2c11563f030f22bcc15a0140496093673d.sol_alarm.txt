The contract provided for analysis:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    uint public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are:
- Integer overflow/underflow: The totalSupply and balances are susceptible to integer overflow/underflow if large values are used for depositing or withdrawing amounts.
- Inconsistent state update: The totalSupply may become inconsistent with the sum of balances due to manual manipulation of balances without updating the totalSupply accordingly. 

Therefore, the vulnerabilities in the contract are integer overflow/underflow and inconsistent state update.
