Based on the provided contract, here are the potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract has multiple state variables such as `proposal`, `startingBlance`, `startingBalanceList`, `lockedFunds`, etc., that are being updated in different functions without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may require a significant amount of gas if `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` condition is not properly optimized, which can lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract lacks explicit visibility modifiers for functions and state variables, which can lead to unintended access or manipulation by external actors.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
