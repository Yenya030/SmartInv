The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
       struct Voter {
             uint256 votedProposals;
             bool hasVoted;
        }
        mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
        uint256 totalVotes;

        function vote(uint256 proposalId) public {
              require(!voters[msg.sender].hasVoted, "Already voted");
              voters[msg.sender].hasVoted = true;
              voters[msg.sender].votedProposals = proposalId;
              totalVotes++;
         }

        function executeProposal() public {
              require(totalVotes > 0, "No votes to execute proposal");
              // execute proposal logic
              totalVotes = 0;
        }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The totalVotes variable is being updated without proper synchronization, potentially leading to an inconsistent state if multiple transactions occur simultaneously.

2) ID uniqueness violation: There is no check for the uniqueness of the proposalId assigned to votedProposals, which could lead to issues if the same proposalId is assigned to multiple voters.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The voters mapping is public, allowing anyone to access and modify the data, which may not be intended. Consider using more restricted visibility levels such as private or internal.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- ID uniqueness violation
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
