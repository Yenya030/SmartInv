The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the votedAmount in the execute function without proper synchronization or checking for reentry, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Reentrancy: The execute function allows an external call to transfer tokens before updating the state, which can potentially be exploited for reentrant attacks.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract declares owner as internal, which may not be the intended visibility level for the variable.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Reentrancy, and Incorrect visibility/ownership.
