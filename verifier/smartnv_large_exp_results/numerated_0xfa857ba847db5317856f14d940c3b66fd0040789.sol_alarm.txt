Potential Vulnerabilities in the Contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `liquidate` in the `ExchangeTokens` contract updates the state variables `debt[user]` and `collateral[user]` without proper validation or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state within the contract.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `calculatePrice` function of the `ExchangeTokens` contract may result in an arithmetic flaw, especially if the division operation (`USDC.balanceOf(address(pair)) / WETH.balanceOf(address(pair))`) encounters division by zero or other arithmetic issues.
