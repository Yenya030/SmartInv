The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect usage of `require` in the `endExecute` function which may lead to inconsistent state update.
2) Lack of proper access control mechanisms for critical functions like `execute` and `endExecute`.
3) Lack of validation for the input parameters in the `execute` function which may lead to arithmetic flaws or integer overflow/underflow.
4) Potential risk of ether leakage in the `endExecute` function as lockedFunds is not protected.
5) Lack of proper visibility for certain state variables, which may lead to incorrect visibility/ownership issues.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- inconsistent state update
- privilege escalation
- arithmetic flaw
- ether leakage
- incorrect visibility/ownership
