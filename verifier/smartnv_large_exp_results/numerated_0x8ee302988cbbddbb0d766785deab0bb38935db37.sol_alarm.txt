Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the owner variable, which could potentially lead to ownership control vulnerabilities.
- Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state variable proposal.votedAmount without proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, which could result in inconsistent state updates.
- Atomicity violation: The endExecute function performs multiple state-changing operations without proper atomicity guarantees, leaving room for potential race condition vulnerabilities.
- Insufficient gas: The endExecute function checks for a condition that may consume a significant amount of gas, which could lead to out-of-gas errors or denial of service attacks.
- Business logic flaw: There may be potential business logic flaws in the contract logic that could be exploited by malicious actors.
