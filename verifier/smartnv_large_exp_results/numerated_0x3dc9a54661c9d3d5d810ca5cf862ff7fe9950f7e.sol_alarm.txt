The contract provided in the question is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not properly update the state of the proposal struct and other variables in the functions 'startExecute', 'execute', and 'endExecute'.

2) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing any address to call functions that should only be accessed by specific roles.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential vulnerability for integer overflow or underflow in calculating balances and amounts within the contract.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during execution due to the complexity of the operations and potential gas limits.

5) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables in the contract are not explicitly specified, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, integer overflow/underflow, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
