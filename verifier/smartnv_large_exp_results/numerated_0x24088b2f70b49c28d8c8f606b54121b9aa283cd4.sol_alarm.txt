Output:
1) Business logic flaw: The "endExecute" function checks if the amount of locked funds is double the total supply of the token to determine a successful execution. This logic may not accurately reflect the success of the execution and could be manipulated.
2) Inconsistent state update: The "proposal.votedAmount += amount;" line in the "execute" function directly updates the state variable without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent data.
