Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) inconsistent state update - The function startExecute updates the state of proposal without proper synchronization, as the struct variable is directly updated without any locking mechanism.
2) ID uniqueness violation - The struct Proposal doesn't contain a unique identifier for each proposal, which may lead to confusion or conflicts if multiple proposals are initiated simultaneously.
