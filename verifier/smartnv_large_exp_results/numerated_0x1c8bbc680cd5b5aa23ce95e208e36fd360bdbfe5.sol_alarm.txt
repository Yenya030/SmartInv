Contract:
```solidity
contract PaymentChannel {
    address public sender;
    address public receiver;
    uint public depositAmount;

    function openChannel(address _receiver) public payable {
        sender = msg.sender;
        receiver = _receiver;
        depositAmount = msg.value;
    }

    function closeChannel(uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == receiver, "Only receiver can close the channel");
        require(amount <= depositAmount, "Amount exceeds deposit");
        
        address(uint160(receiver)).transfer(amount);
        depositAmount -= amount;
    }
}
```

Output:
- atomicity violation
- inconsistent state update
