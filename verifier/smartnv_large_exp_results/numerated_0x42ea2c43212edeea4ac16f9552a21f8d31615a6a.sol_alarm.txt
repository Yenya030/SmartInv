Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute` updates the `lockedFunds` variable but it is not clear how this variable is used or managed elsewhere in the contract. This could lead to inconsistencies in the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility: The visibility of the `votedProposal` function is not specified. Depending on the intended behavior, this could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

3) Insufficient gas: The execution of functions in the contract may require more gas than is provided, leading to transactions failing due to insufficient gas.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not appear to have any mechanism in place to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to data conflicts or unexpected behavior.

5) Business logic flaw: The contract's logic for handling proposals, executions, and end executions may have potential flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors to manipulate the system.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility
- Insufficient gas
- ID uniqueness violation
- Business logic flaw
