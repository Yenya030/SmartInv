The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are: 

1) atomiticy violation in the "startExecute" function as the "proposal" struct is being modified in multiple steps without proper synchronization mechanisms. 

2) privilege escalation in the "endExecute" function as the condition checking for the end of execution can potentially be manipulated by an attacker to execute the function prematurely. 

3) inconsistent state update in the "execute" function as the "proposal.votedAmount" is updated without proper synchronization, potentially leading to incorrect data updates. 

4) incorrect visibility/ownership as there are no visibility modifiers specified for the functions, making them publicly accessible to anyone.
