The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `execute` updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state.

2) Cross bridge inconsistency: There is potential for inconsistency between different parts of the contract, such as in `execute` and `endExecute` functions.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables such as `proposal` and `startingBalanceList`, which can lead to potential issues with ownership and access control.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Cross bridge inconsistency
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
