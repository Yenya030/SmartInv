The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
   - The "proposal.votedAmount" is incremented in the "execute" function without any proper synchronization mechanism, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
   - The contract TimelockController implements the IERC20 interface but does not include the required functions, which can lead to incorrect visibility/ownership issues. 

3) Insufficient gas: 
   - The "endExecute" function may fail to complete if there is insufficient gas provided for the execution.
