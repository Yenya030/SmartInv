The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:
1) Inconsistent state update: The functions startExecute, execute, and endExecute modify the state of the proposal struct in different ways, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The IERC20 interface is being implemented in the TimelockController contract, but it is not clear if all required functions are properly implemented or if the visibility is set correctly for each function.
