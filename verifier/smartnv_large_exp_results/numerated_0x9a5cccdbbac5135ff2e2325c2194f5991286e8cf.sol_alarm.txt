The contract below contains potential vulnerabilities:

contract TimelockController is IERC20 {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 sTime;
        uint256 votedAmount;
        address addr;
    }
    address internal owner;
    IERC20 votingToken;

    function execute(uint256 amount) external {
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 > block.timestamp, "execution has ended");
        require(proposal.votedAmount == 0, "voting hasn't gone through");
        votingToken.transferFrom(proposal.addr, address(this), amount);
        proposal.votedAmount += amount;
        votedProposal(proposal);
    }

    function endExecute() external {
        require(proposal.sTime != 0, "no proposal");
        require(proposal.sTime + 24 < block.timestamp, "execution has not ended");
        require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this)) * 2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");
        lockedFunds = votingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount += amount;` statement inside the execute function can be prone to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to execute concurrently.
2) Atomicity violation: The execution of transferring tokens and updating the voted amount is not done atomically, which could lead to issues if the transfer succeeds but the voted amount update fails.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of `proposal` is not defined, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of the struct data.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
