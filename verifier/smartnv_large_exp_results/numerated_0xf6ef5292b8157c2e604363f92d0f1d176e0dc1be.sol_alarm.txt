Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- ID uniqueness violation: There is no check to ensure uniqueness of addresses in the `balances` mapping, which could lead to overriding existing balances.
- Ether leakage: The `withdraw` function does not properly handle ether transfer and might leave the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is public, which exposes the ownership status of the contract to everyone. It would be better to make it private and provide a getter function if necessary.
