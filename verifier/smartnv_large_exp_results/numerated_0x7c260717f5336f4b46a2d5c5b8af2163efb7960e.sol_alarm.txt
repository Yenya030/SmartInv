The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The liquidate function in ExchangeTokens does not check for the availability of funds before transferring them.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculatePrice function in ExchangeTokens divides two balances without checking for potential division by zero.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: Some variables and functions in the contract are declared as public without considering the implications on visibility and access control.
