Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Business logic flaw: The execute function allows repeated execution of the proposal without proper checks on the state, potentially leading to unintended behavior.
2) Inconsistent state update: The endExecute function updates the lockedFunds variable without proper validation or synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to inconsistent state.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like lockedFunds, proposal, and others is not specified, which could lead to accessibility issues or unintended modifications by external contracts.
