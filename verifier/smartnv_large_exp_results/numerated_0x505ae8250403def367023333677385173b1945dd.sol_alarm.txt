The contract above may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: the owner variable is declared as internal, which might unintentionally allow external access to this variable. 

2) Inconsistent state update: the startingBalanceList mapping is updated in the startExecute function, but it is not clear how this mapping is being used or updated elsewhere in the contract, potentially leading to inconsistent state.

3) Insufficient gas: if the execution of the endExecute function requires a significant amount of gas, it is possible that the function may run out of gas during execution, leading to potential issues.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are Incorrect visibility/ownership, Inconsistent state update, and Insufficient gas.
