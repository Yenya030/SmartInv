Contract to analyze:

contract PaymentProcessor {
     address public owner;
     uint public totalPayments;
     
     mapping(address => uint) public payments;

     constructor() {
         owner = msg.sender;
     }

     function processPayment(address _recipient, uint _amount) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can process payments");
         require(_recipient != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
         require(_amount > 0, "Payment amount must be greater than 0");

         payments[_recipient] += _amount;
         totalPayments += _amount;
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation
2) inconsistent state update
3) incorrect visibility/ownership
