Contract in Analysis:
contract VotingSystem {
    address public admin;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    constructor() {
        admin = msg.sender;
    }

    function vote() public {
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");
        // Vote counting logic
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
}
Output: healthy
