The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable based on the balance of the contract, but it does not ensure that the funds are locked securely, leading to a potential inconsistent state update vulnerability.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract may face gas limitations during the liquidation process, especially if many users attempt to liquidate their funds simultaneously, potentially resulting in an insufficient gas vulnerability.
