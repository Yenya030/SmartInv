The contract contains potential vulnerabilities: 
- Privilege escalation (The execute function can be called multiple times to increase `proposal.votedAmount`, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate the outcome).
- Inconsistent state update (In the endExecute function, the comparison `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` may not accurately reflect the correct state of the contract).
- Integer overflow/underflow (In the liquidate function, the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` may result in integer overflow if the values are not properly constrained).
- Incorrect visibility/ownership (The visibility of the functions is not explicitly defined, which can lead to unintentional security vulnerabilities).
