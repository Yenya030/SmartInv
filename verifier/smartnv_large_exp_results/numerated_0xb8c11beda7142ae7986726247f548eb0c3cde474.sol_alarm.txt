Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility or ownership modifiers for the variables and functions, making them accessible to anyone and potentially leading to security risks.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `startingBalanceList` is updated in the `startExecute` function, but there is no corresponding update or validation for the `startingBlance` variable, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are multiple arithmetic operations in the contract that involve uint variables, such as `proposal.votedAmount += amount` in the `execute` function, which can lead to integer overflow if not handled properly.

4) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function contains a potentially expensive operation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()`, which may require a significant amount of gas and could potentially run out of gas.

5) Privilege escalation: The `proposal` struct is declared as internal, allowing potential privilege escalation if not properly restricted to authorized users only.

6) Ether leakage: The contract does not have any mechanisms in place to handle ether transactions, which may lead to potential ether leakage if ether is mistakenly sent to the contract.

7) Atomicity violation: The contract does not ensure atomicity in the execution of multiple operations, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes if an external call fails midway through the execution.

8) Business logic flaw: The contract lacks proper validation and logic checks, such as ensuring the validity of proposal execution and timing, which can introduce business logic flaws and vulnerabilities.
