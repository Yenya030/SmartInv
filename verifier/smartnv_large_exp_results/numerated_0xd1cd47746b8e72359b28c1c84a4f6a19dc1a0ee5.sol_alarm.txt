The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute` appears to update the state of the `proposal` struct without checking if it is the owner who is calling the function. This can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which means it can be accessed by inheriting contracts. This may lead to incorrect ownership control.
3) Privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any address to start a new proposal without proper authorization, potentially leading to privilege escalation issues.
