The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) privilege escalation - The contract does not restrict access to the `execute` and `endExecute` functions, allowing anyone to call them.
2) inconsistent state update - The `votedProposal` function is called without being defined in the contract, potentially causing inconsistent state updates.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership - The `proposal` struct is declared without any visibility specifier, potentially leading to incorrect ownership control over the data.
4) insufficient gas - The contract does not handle gas limitations, which could result in failed transactions due to insufficient gas.
