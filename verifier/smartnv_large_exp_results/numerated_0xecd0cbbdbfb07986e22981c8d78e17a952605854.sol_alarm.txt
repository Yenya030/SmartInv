The potential vulnerabilities in the contract below are as follows:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owner variable is declared as internal which could potentially lead to ownership control issues.
2) Inconsistent state update - The voting process in the execute function relies on the votedAmount field in the Proposal struct, which could lead to inconsistency in the state update.
3) Insufficient gas - The endExecute function may run out of gas due to the high gas consumption in the require statement.
4) Integer overflow/underflow - There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculatePrice function if the balances of USDC and WETH are very high.
5) Privilege escalation - There is a potential for privilege escalation in this contract due to the lack of access control mechanisms.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Inconsistent state update
- Insufficient gas
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Privilege escalation
