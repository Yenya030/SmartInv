The contract to be analyzed:

```solidity
contract PaymentSystem {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- `Integer overflow/underflow` in the `withdraw` function where the subtraction of `amount` from the sender's balance could result in underflow if `amount` is greater than the sender's balance.
- `Insufficient gas` may occur if the balance mapping grows too large, causing the contract to run out of gas during operations.
- `Incorrect visibility/ownership` as the `balances` mapping is public, allowing anyone to view the balance of any address.
