The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have any mechanism to ensure the uniqueness of proposal IDs, which could lead to conflicts or unintended consequences.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `execute` function updates the `votedAmount` of a proposal without properly handling potential re-entrancy issues, which could result in inconsistent state updates.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is marked as `internal`, which might not be the intended visibility level for a contract owner.

Overall, potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract include ID uniqueness violation, inconsistent state update, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
