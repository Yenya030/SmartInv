The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "endExecute()" function updates the "lockedFunds" variable without properly checking various conditions, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The "liquidate()" function performs arithmetic operations to determine if a user's fund can be liquidated, and there may be potential arithmetic flaws in these calculations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the functions in the contract have the correct visibility and ownership settings, which can lead to vulnerabilities related to access control.
