The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Incorrect visibility: The functions `calculatePrice()` and `liquidate()` are both public, which may expose sensitive operations to unauthorized users. It would be more secure to make them internal or private to restrict access.

2) Insufficient gas: The function `liquidate()` includes token transfers which can consume significant gas. If the gas limit is not set appropriately, it may result in the transaction failing due to running out of gas.

3) Arithmetic flaw: In the `liquidate()` function, the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` could potentially lead to arithmetic flaws if the values used are too large, leading to integer overflow/underflow.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- Arithmetic flaw
