potential vulnerabilities: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the state in a consistent manner, potential issues may arise if the state is not updated properly in all functions causing incorrect behavior.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables and functions, which may lead to unexpected behavior and access control issues.
