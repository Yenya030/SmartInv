The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Business logic flaw: The `execute` function allows for the transfer of tokens without considering the actual voting process, which can lead to unauthorized token transfers.
2) Inconsistent state update: The `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` variable without considering possible race conditions or synchronization issues.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The access control and visibility of functions and variables are not clearly defined, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.

Overall, the contract may be susceptible to business logic flaws, inconsistent state updates, and incorrect visibility/ownership concerns.
