Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the `endExecute` function updates the `lockedFunds` state variable without clear validation or logic, potentially leading to inconsistent data.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` state variable is not specified with any visibility modifier, which can lead to unclear ownership and access control issues.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit provided for transactions, there may be cases where the contract runs out of gas during execution, especially in functions like `endExecute` that involve multiple state changes and calculations.
