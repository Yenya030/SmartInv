Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute` function updates the `proposal` struct but does not check if a proposal is already ongoing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not defined in the contract scope, which may lead to visibility issues and potential unauthorized access.
3) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function updates the `proposal` struct in multiple steps without using locking mechanisms, which could introduce race conditions.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The `votedProposal` function seems to be referencing an external function without its definition provided in the contract, potentially leading to ID uniqueness violations.
5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ETH transfers securely, leaving it susceptible to ether leakage vulnerabilities.
