The contract provided for analysis is:

contract ERC20Token {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    uint public totalSupply;

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint amount) public {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) public {
        require(allowance[from][msg.sender] >= amount, "Not allowed to transfer");
        require(balances[from] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[from] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
