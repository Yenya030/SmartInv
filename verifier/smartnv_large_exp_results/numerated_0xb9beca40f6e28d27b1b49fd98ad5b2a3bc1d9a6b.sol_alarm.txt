The contract provided for analysis is as follows:

contract Lottery {
    address public manager;
    address[] public players;
    
    constructor(){
        manager = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function enter() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0.01 ether, "Minimum entry fee is 0.01 ether");
        players.push(msg.sender);
    }
    
    function random() private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players)));
    }
    
    function pickWinner() public restricted {
        require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can pick a winner");
        uint index = random() % players.length;
        address winner = players[index];
        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);
        players = new address[](0);
    }
    
    modifier restricted() {
        require(msg.sender == manager, "Only the manager can call this function");
        _;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The pickWinner function requires sender to be the manager, however, it does not restrict access to only the manager. This vulnerability can potentially lead to privilege escalation.

2) Insufficient gas: The pickWinner function transfers funds to the winner using transfer(), which could potentially lead to insufficient gas for the transaction to complete successfully.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are incorrect visibility/ownership and insufficient gas.
