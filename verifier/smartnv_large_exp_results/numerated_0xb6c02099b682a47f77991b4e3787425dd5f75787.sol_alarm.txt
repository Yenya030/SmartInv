This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function execute() updates the votedAmount in the Proposal struct, but it does not update the state of the proposal itself. This can lead to an inconsistent state where the votedAmount is updated but the proposal status remains unchanged.

2) Atomicity violation: The execution of the startExecute(), execute(), and endExecute() functions should ideally be atomic operations to ensure proper execution flow. However, there is no explicit handling of atomicity in these functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if multiple operations are called simultaneously.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the owner variable is currently set to internal, which allows it to be accessed by other contracts within the same inheritance tree. Depending on the contract design, this may not be the intended behavior and could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the owner variable.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
