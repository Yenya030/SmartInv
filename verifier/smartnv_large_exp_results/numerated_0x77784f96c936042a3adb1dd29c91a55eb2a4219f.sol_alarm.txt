The potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract's token holdings, which can lead to inconsistent state if the token balances change unexpectedly.

2) Business logic flaw: The endExecute() function checks if the total balance of the contract's token holdings is more than double the total token supply, which may not be a valid condition for execution success and could lead to unexpected behavior.

3) Insufficient gas: There is a risk of running out of gas during the execution of functions that involve token transfers, which could result in incomplete or failed transactions.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The ownership of the contract and the visibility of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, which can lead to confusion and potential security risks.
