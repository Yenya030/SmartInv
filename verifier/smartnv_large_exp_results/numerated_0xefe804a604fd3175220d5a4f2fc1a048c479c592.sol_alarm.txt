The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: the variable `lockedFunds` is updated based on the balance of the `votingToken` contract, which might not accurately reflect the actual locked funds.
2) Atomicity violation: the `execute` function can be called multiple times by different users, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
3) Privilege escalation: the `votingToken.transferFrom` function in the `execute` function does not have proper access control, allowing any user to transfer tokens on behalf of the contract.
4) Business logic flaw: the condition `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply()` in the `endExecute` function might not accurately verify the execution success.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, privilege escalation, and business logic flaw.
