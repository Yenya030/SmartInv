Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` is updated without any synchronization mechanism or checks to prevent multiple executions of the `endExecute` function simultaneously, leading to potential inconsistencies in the state.

2) Incorrect visibility: The `proposal` struct and the `startingBalanceList` mapping are not specified with any visibility modifier, making them publicly accessible and modifiable by anyone, which may introduce security risks.

3) Uninitialized variables: The variable `startingBlance` is declared but not initialized in the `startExecute` function, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or vulnerabilities.

4) Insufficient gas: Lack of gas estimation or gas limit checks in the functions may result in out-of-gas exceptions, preventing the successful execution of the contract functions.

5) Ownership authorization: There are no explicit checks for authorization or ownership verification in the functions, allowing anyone to call and potentially manipulate the contract functionalities.
