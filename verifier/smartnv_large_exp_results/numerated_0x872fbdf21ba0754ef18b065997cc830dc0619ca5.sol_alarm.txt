The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable, but it doesn't revert the changes if the subsequent require statement fails, which may lead to an inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as internal, which could restrict access to this variable in derived contracts. Consider using public or private visibility as appropriate.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
