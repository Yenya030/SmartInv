Contract:

contract PaymentProcessor {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint) public payments;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function processPayment(address _recipient, uint _amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can process payments");
        payments[_recipient] += _amount;
    }

    function withdrawPayment(address _recipient) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw payments");
        uint amount = payments[_recipient];
        msg.sender.transfer(amount);
        payments[_recipient] = 0;
    }
}

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
