Potential vulnerabilities in the following contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify any visibility for the variables `owner` and `votingToken`, which could lead to potential access control issues.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `startExecute()` function updates the state variable `proposal` without initializing it first, which may lead to unpredictable behavior.

3) Atomicity violation: The `execute()` function includes multiple state-changing operations (transfer and updating `proposal.votedAmount`) without using mutex or other mechanisms to ensure atomicity.

4) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential for integer overflow in the calculation `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2`, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

5) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute()` function may run out of gas when checking the balance and total supply of the `votingToken`, potentially causing the function to fail.

6) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `debt` and `collateral` mappings are public, which may expose sensitive user data to unauthorized access.

7) Inconsistent state update: The `liquidate()` function updates the state variables `debt` and `collateral` without proper validation or error handling, which may result in an inconsistent or incorrect state.
