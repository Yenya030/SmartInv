contract PaymentGateway {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than 0");
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

The potential vulnerabilities in the PaymentGateway contract are:
1) Integer overflow/underflow: There is a potential vulnerability of integer underflow in the withdraw function when subtracting the amount from the user's balance without checking if it would result in a negative balance.
2) Ether leakage: The transfer function in the withdraw method can potentially lead to ether leakage if the transfer fails, leaving the user's balance inconsistent with the actual ether amount.
3) Insufficient gas: If the contract holds a large number of users with significant balances, the withdrawal function may run out of gas due to looping through all the balances, resulting in an incomplete withdrawal process.
