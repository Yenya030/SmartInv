Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of variables `owner`, `votingToken`, `proposal`, `startingBalanceList`, and `lockedFunds`, making them potentially accessible or modifiable by external contracts.
- Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incremented in the `execute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
- Insufficient gas: The `execute` function does not consider potential gas limitations for the transfer operation, which could result in the function failing due to insufficient gas.
- Business logic flaw: The check in the `endExecute` function `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` seems to be incorrect, as it compares twice the balance of the contract with the total token supply, potentially impacting the execution logic.
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not enforce uniqueness for the proposal ID, which could lead to issues if multiple proposals are created with the same ID.
- Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether payments or transfers securely, potentially leading to unintentional ether leakage.
- Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without proper synchronization mechanisms, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.
