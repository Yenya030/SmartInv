The contract you are going to analyze:
contract TokenSale {
     mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
     IERC20 public token;

     function buyTokens(uint256 amount) external {
         uint256 price = getTokenPrice(amount);
         require(token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Not enough tokens in the contract"); 
         require(token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= amount, "Not enough allowance for token transfer");
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
         balances[msg.sender] += amount;
         payWithEth(price);
     }

     function getTokenPrice(uint256 amount) internal returns (uint256) {
         // Calculate token price based on amount
     }

     function payWithEth(uint256 amount) internal {
         // Handle payment with ETH
     }
}
Output: 
- Business logic flaw: The contract doesn't clearly define the token price calculation in the `getTokenPrice` function. This could lead to inconsistencies or vulnerabilities in determining the correct token price, allowing for potential exploitation.
- Inconsistent state update: The `balances` mapping is directly updated without considering potential race conditions or ensuring proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state updates or reentrancy vulnerabilities.
