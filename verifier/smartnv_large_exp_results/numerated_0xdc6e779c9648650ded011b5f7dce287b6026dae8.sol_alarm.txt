Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) privilege escalation: The contract does not adequately check for ownership when executing certain functions.
2) inconsistent state update: There is a possibility of inconsistent state updates during proposal execution.
3) atomicity violation: There is a lack of atomicity in the execution function where multiple state changes occur.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain variables and functions are not clearly defined, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
