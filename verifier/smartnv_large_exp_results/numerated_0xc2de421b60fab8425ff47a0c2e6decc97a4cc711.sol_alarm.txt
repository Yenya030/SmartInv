The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are as follows:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract may have an inconsistent state update issue due to multiple state variables being updated separately without proper synchronization.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of the functions and variables are not clearly defined, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.

3) Integer overflow/underflow: There are operations involving arithmetic calculations that could potentially result in integer overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transfer securely, which may result in Ether leakage or unauthorized withdrawals.

5) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas limits for certain operations, which may result in out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.

6) Business logic flaw: There could be potential business logic flaws in the contract that may lead to undesired outcomes or vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, integer overflow/underflow, ether leakage, insufficient gas, and business logic flaw.
