The contract provided for analysis:

contract FinancialContract {
     struct Transaction {
          uint256 amount;
          address recipient;
          uint256 timestamp;
     }
     mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
     mapping(address => Transaction[]) public transactionHistory;
     
     function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
          balances[msg.sender] += amount;
     }
     
     function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
         require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
         balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
     }
     
     function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
          require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
          balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
          balances[recipient] += amount;
          transactionHistory[msg.sender].push(Transaction(amount, recipient, block.timestamp));
          transactionHistory[recipient].push(Transaction(amount, msg.sender, block.timestamp));
     }
}

Output: 
No vulnerabilities were identified in the provided FinancialContract. Therefore, the output is healthy.
