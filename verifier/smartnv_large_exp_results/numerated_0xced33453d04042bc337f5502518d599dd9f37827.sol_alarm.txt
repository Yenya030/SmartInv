Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates the `lockedFunds` variable without performing any checks or validations, which could lead to unexpected or incorrect state changes.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the `votedProposal()` function is not specified, which could lead to potential accessibility issues or unintended external calls.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, there is a possibility that certain operations within the contract may require more gas than available, leading to incomplete executions or failed transactions.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
