This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) business logic flaw: The endExecute() function may have a business logic flaw as it is not properly checking for the success of the execution when determining if the execution failed. 

2) inconsistent state update: The execute() function may be inconsistent in updating the proposal.votedAmount as there is no proper check if the transferFrom operation fails.

3) atomicity violation: The startExecute() function may have an atomicity violation issue as it sets multiple variables without any method to ensure these operations are done atomically.

4) incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not properly control access and visibility.

5) insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit, the execution of functions such as execute() and endExecute() could potentially fail due to insufficient gas.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are business logic flaw, inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
