        isPaid = false;

        require(msg.sender == buyer && msg.value == price, "Invalid payment");

    }

    function releasePayment() external {
        require(msg.sender == owner && isPaid, "Payment not made");
        payable(seller).transfer(price);
    }
} 

Output:
1) Incorrect Visibility/Ownership: The "owner" variable is public, exposing the contract's owner to all users, which can lead to privilege escalation.
2) Integer Underflow: There is no check for underflow in the subtraction operation in the "pay" function when verifying the payment amount against the price.
3) Insufficient Gas: The "releasePayment" function sends funds using "transfer", which may fail if the receiver incurs high gas costs, leading to funds being trapped in the contract.
