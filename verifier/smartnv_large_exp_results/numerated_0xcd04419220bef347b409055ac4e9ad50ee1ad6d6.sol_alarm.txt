The contract you provided seems to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) lack of access control: The contract seems to lack proper access control mechanisms, which could result in unauthorized users executing certain functions.
2) potential reentrancy: There might be reentrancy vulnerabilities in the contract due to the order of operations and calling external functions.
3) insufficient gas: There is a possibility of running out of gas during the execution of transactions, as the gas usage is not optimized.
4) inconsistent state update: There could be inconsistencies in updating the state variables, leading to unexpected behavior.
5) potential business logic flaws: The logic in some functions may not be adequately addressing certain conditions or scenarios, potentially leading to vulnerabilities.

Please review and address these potential vulnerabilities in the contract accordingly.
