This contract may have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not have proper checks for updating the state of the proposal. The `execute` function updates the `proposal.votedAmount` without considering potential re-entrancy issues or atomicity violations.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is not marked as private in the contract, potentially exposing it to external manipulation.

3) Insufficient gas: Depending on the gas limit set for transactions, there may be potential issues with the gas consumption in functions like `endExecute`.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are Inconsistent state update, Incorrect visibility/ownership, and Insufficient gas.
