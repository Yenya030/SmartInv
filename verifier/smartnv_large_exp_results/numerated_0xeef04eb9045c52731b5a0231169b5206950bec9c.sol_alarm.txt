Potential vulnerabilities in the contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not handle updating the state of `lockedFunds` consistently throughout the functions, which may lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in the contract state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `lockedFunds` variable, which could lead to potential issues with access control and ownership.
3) Business logic flaw: The execution of the `endExecute` function may not accurately reflect the intended business logic, as the condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` could potentially be flawed and lead to unexpected outcomes.
