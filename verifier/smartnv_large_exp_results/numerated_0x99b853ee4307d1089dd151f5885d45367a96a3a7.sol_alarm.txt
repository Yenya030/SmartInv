Contract to analyze: 

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint256 weight; 
        bool voted; 
        address delegate; 
        uint256 vote; 
    }
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    uint256 public totalVotes;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted");
        require(to != msg.sender, "Self-delegation is not allowed");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation");
        }
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;

        Voter storage delegateVoter = voters[to];
        if (delegateVoter.voted) {
            totalVotes += sender.weight;
        } else {
            delegateVoter.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint256 option) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "Already voted");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = option;

        totalVotes += sender.weight;
    }
}
Potential vulnerabilities: 
- No major vulnerabilities found in the contract - healthy.
