Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not ensure that the state variables are updated in a consistent manner, which could lead to unexpected behavior or manipulation of the state.

2) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider the gas consumption of its functions, which could potentially result in transactions failing due to running out of gas.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables within the contract is not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.
