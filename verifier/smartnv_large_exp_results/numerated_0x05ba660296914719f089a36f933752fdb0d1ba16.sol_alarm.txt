The contract you provided seems to have the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal` is being updated in different functions (`startExecute`, `execute`, `endExecute`) without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state issues.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but doesn't seem to provide any token-related functionality or state. It's unclear how ownership or visibility is properly managed within the contract.

3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function transfers tokens from the `proposal.addr` to the contract address, but there is no check for whether the contract has enough gas to handle potential reverts during the transfer.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
