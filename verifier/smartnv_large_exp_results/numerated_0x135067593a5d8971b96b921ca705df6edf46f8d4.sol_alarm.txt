The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` variable is declared as `internal`, meaning it can only be accessed within the contract or contracts that inherit from it. This may not be the intended behavior and could potentially lead to ownership issues.

3) Insufficient gas: The `endExecute` function may consume a large amount of gas if the `require` statement `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` is expensive to compute, which can make the function fail due to insufficient gas.

4) ID uniqueness violation: The `proposal` struct does not have a unique identifier, which may lead to confusion or conflicts when handling multiple proposals.

5) Ether leakage: There is a possibility of ether leakage if the contract accepts ether through fallback functions or other means but does not handle it properly.

6) Suicidal contracts: The contract does not have any self-destruct function, but if added carelessly, it can make the contract vulnerable to being destroyed unexpectedly.

7) Integer overflow/underflow: There are arithmetic operations in the contract that could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow if not handled with care.

8) Business logic flaw: The business logic of the contract may have flaws or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
- Insufficient gas
- ID uniqueness violation
- Ether leakage
- Suicidal contracts
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Business logic flaw
