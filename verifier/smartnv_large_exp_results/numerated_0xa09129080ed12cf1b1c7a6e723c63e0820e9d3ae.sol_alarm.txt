Output:
- Business logic flaw: The function `execute` can be called multiple times for the same proposal, potentially allowing someone to manipulate the voting outcome by repeatedly transferring tokens.
- Privilege escalation: The `execute` function is accessible externally, potentially allowing unauthorized users to call it and manipulate the voted amount.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` and `votingToken` variables are marked as private, but they may need to be accessed by other contracts or users, leading to potential access control issues.

Overall Vulnerabilities: Business logic flaw, privilege escalation, incorrect visibility/ownership.
