The contract provided for analysis contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `endExecute()` updates `lockedFunds` based on the balance of the contract at a specific point in time. This can lead to inconsistent state if the balance changes before the function execution completes.

2) Incorrect visibility: The variables `debt` and `collateral` are declared as public, making their values accessible to anyone. This can expose sensitive information and potentially lead to exploits.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are "inconsistent state update" and "incorrect visibility".
