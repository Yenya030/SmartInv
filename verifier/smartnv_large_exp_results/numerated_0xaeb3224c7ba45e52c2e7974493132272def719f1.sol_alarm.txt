The contract provided for analysis is:

```solidity
contract Lottery {
    address public manager;
    address[] public players;

    constructor() {
        manager = msg.sender;
    }

    function enter() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0.01 ether);
        players.push(msg.sender);
    }

    function pickWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == manager);
        uint index = random() % players.length;
        address winner = players[index];
        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);
        players = new address[](0);
    }

    function random() private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.difficulty, block.timestamp, players)));
    }
}
```

The potential vulnerabilities in the "Lottery" contract are:

1) privilege escalation: The "pickWinner" function can only be called by the "manager" address, but there is no access control in place to prevent unauthorized access to this function.
2) inconsistent state update: Upon selecting a winner in the "pickWinner" function, the players array is reset to an empty array. This may lead to unexpected behavior if there are any pending transactions or other dependent functions relying on the existing player data.
3) integer overflow: In the "random" function, the use of the keccak256 hashing function may not provide sufficient randomness, leading to a potential integer overflow vulnerability.
4) insufficient gas: The "pickWinner" function transfers the entire balance of the contract to the selected winner using "transfer", which may fail if the gas stipend is not enough to cover the transfer. It's advisable to use "call" in combination with appropriate gas limits for external transfers to avoid this issue.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the "Lottery" contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, integer overflow, and insufficient gas.
