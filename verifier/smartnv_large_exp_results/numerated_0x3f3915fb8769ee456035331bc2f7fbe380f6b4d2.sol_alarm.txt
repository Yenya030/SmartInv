The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: 
- "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function, but there seems to be missing synchronization or proper state management for this variable.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: 
- It is not clear if proper access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict access to sensitive functions like startExecute, execute, and endExecute. 

3) Integer overflow/underflow:
- There are calculations involving uint variables that may be susceptible to integer overflow/underflow, such as in the calculation of "startingBalance" in the "startExecute" function.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and integer overflow/underflow.
