The contract provided for analysis: 

contract VotingSystem {
    struct Voter {
        uint weight;
        bool voted;
        address delegate;
        uint vote;
    }
    struct Proposal {
        uint voteCount;
    }

    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    Proposal[] public proposals;
    address public chairperson;

    function delegate(address to) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");

        while (voters[to].delegate != address(0)) {
            to = voters[to].delegate;
            require(to != msg.sender, "Found loop in delegation.");
        }

        sender.voted = true;
        sender.delegate = to;
        Voter storage delegate_ = voters[to];

        if (delegate_.voted) {
            proposals[delegate_.vote].voteCount += sender.weight;
        } else {
            delegate_.weight += sender.weight;
        }
    }

    function vote(uint proposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "You already voted.");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = proposal;
        proposals[proposal].voteCount += sender.weight;
    }
} 

Based on the contract provided for analysis, the potential vulnerabilities are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state of the voter's weight is updated in the delegate function based on the delegate's vote status, which can lead to inconsistent state updates if not handled carefully. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of functions and variables in the contract may expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. 

3) Insufficient gas: The contract's operations may require more gas than available, leading to incomplete execution and potential vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership, and insufficient gas.
