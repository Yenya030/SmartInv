contract Lottery {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalTickets;
    mapping(address => uint) public tickets;

    function buyTickets(uint amount) public payable {
        require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect amount sent");
        tickets[msg.sender] += 1;
        totalTickets += 1;
    }

    function selectWinner() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can select winner");
        uint winnerIndex = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % totalTickets;
        address winner = getAddressByIndex(winnerIndex);
        payable(winner).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    function getAddressByIndex(uint index) internal view returns (address) {
        // implementation details omitted for brevity
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not ensure unique ticket IDs for each participant, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected behaviors when selecting a winner.

10) Arithmetic flaw: The method for selecting a winner using keccak256 and modulo may not provide a fair distribution of winners, potentially introducing biases or vulnerabilities in the lottery system. 

14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: There may be issues related to the visibility and ownership of functions, allowing unauthorized users to manipulate the contract or access functionalities that should be restricted to the owner.

So, the vulnerabilities present in the contract are ID uniqueness violation, arithmetic flaw, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
