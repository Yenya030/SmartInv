The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

7) ID uniqueness violation: The contract does not have a mechanism to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
10) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate` function could potentially lead to arithmetic flaws or unexpected behavior if the values involved are not properly handled.
12) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle Ether transactions securely, which could lead to unintended Ether leakage or loss.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are appropriately set, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.
