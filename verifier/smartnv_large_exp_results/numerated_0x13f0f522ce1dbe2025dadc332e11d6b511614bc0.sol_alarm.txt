The contract provided: 

contract MultiSigWallet {
    mapping(address => uint) public owners;
    mapping(uint => bool) public transactions;
    uint public transactionCount;
    
    function submitTransaction(uint _transactionId) public {
        require(owners[msg.sender] == 1, "Sender is not an owner");
        transactions[_transactionId] = true;
        transactionCount++;
    }
    
    function executeTransaction(uint _transactionId) public {
        require(transactions[_transactionId] == true, "Transaction does not exist");
        // Code to execute transaction
        delete transactions[_transactionId];
        transactionCount--;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are: 
1) Inconsistent state update - The transaction count is incremented in submitTransaction() but not decremented in executeTransaction(), potentially leading to an inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership - The owners mapping should be private to prevent external manipulation. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
