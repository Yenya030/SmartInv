Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The execution of the functions in the contract may lead to inconsistent states within the struct Proposal and other variables.
2) Insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas during the execution of functions that interact with external contracts and operations.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership permissions are not clearly defined for certain functions and variables in the contract, leading to potential security risks.
