The potential vulnerabilities in the following contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without properly initializing it. This could lead to inconsistent state updates within the contract.

2) Atomicity violation: The function `execute()` performs multiple state-changing operations without using any form of atomicity guarantee, which could result in unexpected behavior if one of the operations fails.

3) Insufficient gas: The function `endExecute()` performs a complex operation by checking the balance of the contract compared to the total token supply. If the gas provided to this function is not sufficient to complete the operation, it could result in the function reverting and potentially destabilizing the contract's state.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the visibility of the `proposal` struct, making it accessible to all other contracts, potentially compromising data integrity and security. Additionally, the `owner` variable is declared as `internal`, which may not be the intended visibility level.

Therefore, the identified potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Atomicity violation
- Insufficient gas
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
