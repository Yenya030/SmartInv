The contract being analyzed: 

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(address => uint) public votes;
    uint public totalVotes;

    function vote() public {
        votes[msg.sender]++;
        totalVotes++;
    }

    function unvote() public {
        require(votes[msg.sender] > 0, "No votes to unvote");
        votes[msg.sender]--;
        totalVotes--;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: 
4) inconsistent state update
7) ID uniqueness violation
11) suicidal contracts
