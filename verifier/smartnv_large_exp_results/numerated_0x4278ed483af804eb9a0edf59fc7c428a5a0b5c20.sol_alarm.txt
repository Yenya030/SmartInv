Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function liquidate in ExchangeTokens contract updates the debt and collateral mapping without checking for any conditions, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the require statement of the liquidate function may result in an arithmetic flaw if the variables involved have unexpected values.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables WETH, USDC, and pair in ExchangeTokens contract are declared as public, which could expose sensitive information and potentially lead to ownership concerns.
