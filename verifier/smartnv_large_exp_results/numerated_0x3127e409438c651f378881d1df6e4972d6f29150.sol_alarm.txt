The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities in its code. Here are the identified vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function "startExecute" updates the state of the proposal without ensuring atomicity, which may lead to inconsistent state updates if multiple transactions try to update the same proposal concurrently.

2) Integer overflow: The variable "proposal.votedAmount" in the "execute" function can potentially lead to an integer overflow if the total amount of votes exceeds the maximum uint256 value, which may have unintended consequences.

3) Insufficient gas: The "endExecute" function includes a check that compares the balance of the contract to two times the total token supply, which may consume a large amount of gas and potentially lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.

Thus, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, integer overflow, and insufficient gas.
