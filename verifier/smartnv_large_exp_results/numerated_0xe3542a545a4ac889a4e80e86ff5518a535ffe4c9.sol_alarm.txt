The following contract may have the following vulnerabilities:

1) privilege escalation: The contract does not have any access control mechanism to restrict certain functions to authorized users only.
2) inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is incrementing in the `execute` function without any check on the maximum amount that can be voted, leading to a potential inconsistent state.
3) integer overflow/underflow: There is a possibility of integer overflow in the calculation `getPrice() * cAmount * 80 / 100` inside the `liquidate` function.
4) incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear if the visibility of the variables `debt`, `collateral`, `pair` is intended to be public, which could expose sensitive information.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are privilege escalation, inconsistent state update, integer overflow/underflow, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
