Potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract:

1) ID uniqueness violation: There is no indication of unique identifiers for proposals or any mechanism to prevent duplicate proposals from being created.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The owner variable is declared as internal, which may not accurately represent the intended visibility and ownership control.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function may require more gas than is available to complete its execution, leading to potential failures or incomplete operations.
4) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the votedAmount in the proposal struct, but there is no indication of how this information is being used or validated in the contract.
5) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function condition for checking if the execution failed based on the balance of the contract may not accurately reflect the intended business logic of the contract. 

Overall, the contract may have potential vulnerabilities related to ID uniqueness violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, insufficient gas, inconsistent state update, and business logic flaws.
