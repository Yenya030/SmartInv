The provided code snippet contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The 'lockedFunds' variable in the 'endExecute' function is updated directly without using the 'proposal' struct, leading to a potential state inconsistency.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is defined as a local variable in the contract without specifying any visibility (public, internal, etc.), which can lead to unintended behavior or data exposure.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- Inconsistent state update
- Incorrect visibility/ownership
