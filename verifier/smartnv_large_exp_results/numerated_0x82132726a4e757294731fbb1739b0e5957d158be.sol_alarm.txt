Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract: 
1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without resetting the `votedAmount`, potentially leading to inconsistent state.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController is trying to implement the interface IERC20 but does not define functions from IERC20. This can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership issues.
