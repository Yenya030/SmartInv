Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis:

1) Inconsistent state update: The contract updates the state variable `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute()` function without properly handling concurrent calls that could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify visibility modifiers for the functions which could lead to issues with access control and ownership.

Output: inconsistent state update, incorrect visibility/ownership.
