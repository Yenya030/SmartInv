The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

6) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract ExchangeTokens uses a function getPrice() which is not defined in the contract. This could lead to inconsistency or confusion in the contract's logic.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The variables debt and collateral are declared as public, which may expose sensitive user information. 

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are cross bridge inconsistency and incorrect visibility/ownership.
