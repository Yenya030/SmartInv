The contract you provided contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute()` function is being updated, but there is no indication of what this variable is used for or how it affects the contract state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the `IERC20` interface but does not provide the necessary functions or implementations to comply with the interface. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
