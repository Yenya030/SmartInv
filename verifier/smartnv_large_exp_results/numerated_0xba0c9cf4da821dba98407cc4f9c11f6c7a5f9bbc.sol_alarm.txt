The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The function `startExecute()` updates the `proposal` struct without properly initializing it, which can lead to inconsistent state updates.

2) Privilege escalation: The `owner` variable is not used or updated within the contract, potentially leading to privilege escalation vulnerabilities if not properly managed.

3) Atomicity violation: The function `execute()` performs multiple state changes without utilizing proper atomicity checks, which can result in inconsistencies in the contract state.

4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: It is not clear how ownership and access control are managed in the contract, which can lead to incorrect visibility or ownership vulnerabilities. 

5) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transfers or deposits properly, which can result in ether leakage vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, privilege escalation, atomicity violation, incorrect visibility/ownership, and ether leakage.
