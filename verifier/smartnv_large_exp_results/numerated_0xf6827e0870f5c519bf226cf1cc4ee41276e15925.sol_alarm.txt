Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis:
1) Business logic flaw: The `endExecute` function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than twice the total supply of the voting token to determine if the execution was successful. This check may not accurately reflect the success of the execution and could lead to incorrect outcomes.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `proposal` variables are not specified with an explicit visibility modifier, which may lead to unintended access levels or ownership issues.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of gas-related error handling in functions like `execute`, where transferring tokens within that function may lead to out-of-gas exceptions.
