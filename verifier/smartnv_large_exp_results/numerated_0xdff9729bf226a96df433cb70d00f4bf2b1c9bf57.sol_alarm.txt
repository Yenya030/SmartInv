The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `owner` variable is declared as internal, which may not be intended. It should be explicitly defined as private or public to ensure proper access control.

2) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function without any checks for possible reentrancy or other potential issues that may arise from updating the state variable.

3) Business logic flaw: The condition `require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed");` in the `endExecute` function may lead to unexpected behavior depending on the implementation of `votingToken` and how the balance and total supply are managed.

4) Insufficient gas: The contract does not handle out-of-gas exceptions which can potentially lead to failed transactions and unexpected behavior.

5) ID uniqueness violation: There are no mechanisms in place to ensure uniqueness of IDs for proposals, which may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
