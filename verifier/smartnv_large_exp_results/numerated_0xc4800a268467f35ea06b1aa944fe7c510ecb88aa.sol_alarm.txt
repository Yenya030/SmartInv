The potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided for analysis are:

1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of the struct Proposal, which could lead to potential issues.
2) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal by incrementing the votedAmount without proper synchronization or atomicity checks, which could lead to inconsistent state.
3) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a potentially gas-intensive operation by checking if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total supply of the token. This could lead to out-of-gas errors.
4) ID uniqueness violation: The contract uses addr as an identifier for proposals, but there is no check for uniqueness, which could lead to conflicts or overwriting of existing proposals.
5) Suicidal contracts: There are no safeguards to prevent the contract from self-destructing, which could lead to loss of funds or disruption in functionality.
6) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether transactions, but if ether is accidentally sent to the contract, it could be trapped in the contract indefinitely without a way to withdraw.
7) Privilege escalation: The contract does not have proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from executing certain functions or accessing sensitive data.
8) Business logic flaw: The endExecute function may have a flaw in the logic of determining when an execution has ended, as it checks if the balance of the contract is more than twice the total token supply, which may not be the intended condition.
