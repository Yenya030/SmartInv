Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function startExecute updates the state variables proposal and startingBalanceList without proper synchronization, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Boolean logic flaw: The condition "require(votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))*2 > votingToken.totalSupply(), "execution failed")" in the function endExecute seems illogical and may lead to unexpected behavior.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract TimelockController doesn't explicitly define the visibility of the struct Proposal, which may lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
