The contract provided above contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without utilizing proper synchronization mechanisms, which may lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly specify the visibility of the `proposal` struct, which could potentially lead to issues related to ownership and access control. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
