The contract you provided is vulnerable to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is updated in the `endExecute()` function without ensuring the proper conditions are met, potentially leading to incorrect state updates.

2) Arithmetic flaw: The calculation in the `liquidate()` function to determine if a user's fund can be liquidated may result in arithmetic flaws if the values used in the calculation are not carefully considered.

3) Price manipulation: The `calculatePrice()` function may be vulnerable to price manipulation if the contract relies on the external `USDC` and `WETH` balances without proper validation or verification. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, arithmetic flaw, and price manipulation.
