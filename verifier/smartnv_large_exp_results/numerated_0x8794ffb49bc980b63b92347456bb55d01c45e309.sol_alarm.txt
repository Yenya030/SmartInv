The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:
1) privilege escalation: The function execute() can be called by any address, allowing potential privilege escalation.
2) inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates lockedFunds without checking if the execution was successful or if the proposal has votes, resulting in potential inconsistent state.
3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is missing visibility modifiers for the functions, which can lead to potential security risks.
