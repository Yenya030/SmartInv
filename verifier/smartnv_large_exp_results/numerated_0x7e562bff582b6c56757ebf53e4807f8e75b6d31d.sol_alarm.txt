The contract to be analyzed:

contract EscrowContract {
    address public seller;
    address public buyer;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public funds;
    bool public releasedToSeller;
    bool public releasedToBuyer;

    function createEscrow(address _seller, address _buyer, address _arbiter) {
        seller = _seller;
        buyer = _buyer;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        funds = msg.value;
        releasedToSeller = false;
        releasedToBuyer = false;
    }

    function releaseToSeller() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter);
        require(releasedToSeller == false);
        seller.transfer(funds);
        releasedToSeller = true;
    }

    function releaseToBuyer() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter);
        require(releasedToBuyer == false);
        buyer.transfer(funds);
        releasedToBuyer = true;
    }
}

Output: 
- Privilege escalation: The arbiter is able to release funds to either the seller or the buyer, potentially leading to a misuse of power.
- Inconsistent state update: The state variables releasedToSeller and releasedToBuyer are being updated separately without any linkage, which can result in unexpected behavior.
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the createEscrow function is not specified, making it public by default, which might not be intended.
