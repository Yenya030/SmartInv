The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The state variable `lockedFunds` is being updated in the `endExecute` function, but there is no indication or control over how this variable can be accessed or modified externally. 
   
2) Atomicity violation: The `execute` function is transferring tokens and updating state variables, but there is no use of a locking mechanism or other method to ensure atomicity of these operations.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract is implementing the `IERC20` interface but it is not clear how the ownership of the tokens is handled or if there are any visibility modifiers specified for the functions.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the given contract are inconsistent state update, atomicity violation, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
