Potential vulnerabilities in the contract provided: 

1) Inconsistent state update: The `execute` function modifies the `proposal.votedAmount` without updating the state variable for `votedAmount` in the `Proposal` struct. This can lead to inconsistent state and incorrect calculations.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `proposal` struct is not marked as private, which can expose sensitive data to external manipulation or access.
3) Insufficient gas: The `execute` function transfers tokens without specifying a gas limit, which can lead to out-of-gas exceptions and failed transactions.
4) Privilege escalation: The `startExecute` function allows any external account to initialize a proposal, which can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of proposals.
5) Atomicity violation: The `endExecute` function checks the balance of the contract and updates `lockedFunds` in two separate steps, potentially allowing for race conditions and inconsistent state.
6) ID uniqueness violation: There is no mechanism in place to ensure unique identifiers for proposals, which can lead to conflicts and incorrect referencing of proposals.
7) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle unexpected ether transfers, which can result in Ether being locked in the contract without a way to retrieve it.
8) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `lockedFunds` variable is not marked as private, exposing the locked funds amount to external access and manipulation.
