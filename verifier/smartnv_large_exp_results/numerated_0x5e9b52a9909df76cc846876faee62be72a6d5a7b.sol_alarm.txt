Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Privilege escalation: The contract lacks proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can execute certain functions, which could lead to privilege escalation.
2) Inconsistent state update: There are potential inconsistencies in the state update within the functions, such as the manipulation of proposal variables without proper checks or balance updates without proper validation.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of consideration for gas limits in certain operations, which could result in out-of-gas errors during execution.
4) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility and ownership of certain functions and variables are not clearly defined, which could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of critical contract components.
