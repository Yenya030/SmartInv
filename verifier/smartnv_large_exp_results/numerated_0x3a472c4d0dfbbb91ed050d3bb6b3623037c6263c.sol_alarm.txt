The potential vulnerabilities in the provided contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `lockedFunds` variable is updated in the `endExecute` function but may not be properly synchronized with the rest of the contract state. 

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract inherits from `IERC20` interface but does not implement all the required functions, which can lead to visibility issues. 

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and incorrect visibility/ownership.
