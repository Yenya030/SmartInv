Contract being analyzed:

contract Escrow {
    address public beneficiary;
    address public depositor;
    uint public depositedAmount;

    function deposit(address _beneficiary) public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Amount should be greater than 0");
        depositor = msg.sender;
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        depositedAmount = msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == beneficiary, "Only beneficiary can withdraw");
        payable(beneficiary).transfer(depositedAmount);
        depositedAmount = 0;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the Escrow contract:
1) Incorrect ownership/visibility: The `withdraw` function allows anyone to withdraw the deposited amount as long as they set themselves as the beneficiary. This could be a privilege escalation vulnerability.
2) Insufficient gas: If the `withdraw` function does not have enough gas to complete the transfer, it could result in a failure to execute the function completely, leaving the deposited amount in limbo.
3) Inconsistent state update: There is no check to ensure that the deposited amount is not withdrawn more than once, potentially leading to double withdrawal.
