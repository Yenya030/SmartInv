The contract provided is:

contract VotingSystem {
     struct Voter {
          uint256 weight;
          bool voted;
          address delegate;
          uint256 vote;
     }
     mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
     address public owner;

     function delegate(address to) public {
          require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "You have no right to delegate");
          require(to != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate to yourself");
          voters[msg.sender].delegate = to;
     }

     function vote(uint256 option) public {
          require(voters[msg.sender].weight > 0, "You have no right to vote");
          require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "You have already voted");

          voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
          voters[msg.sender].vote = option;
     }

     function endVoting() public {
          require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can end voting");
          // Check for the winning option and execute actions based on the result
     }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The function endVoting() does not restrict access to the owner properly and may allow unauthorized users to end the voting process.
- Inconsistent state update: The delegate function updates the delegate address without considering the implications of changing the delegate, which could lead to inconsistent state.
- ID uniqueness violation: The contract lacks a mechanism to ensure uniqueness of voter addresses, which could potentially lead to issues with voter identification.
