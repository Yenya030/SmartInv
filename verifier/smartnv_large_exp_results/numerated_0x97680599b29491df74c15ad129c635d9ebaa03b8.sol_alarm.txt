The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The `proposal.votedAmount` is updated in the `execute` function without proper synchronization, which could lead to inconsistent state.

2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The `votingToken` and `owner` variables are declared as internal, which might not be suitable depending on the intended use case.

3) Insufficient gas: There could be potential issues with gas consumption in functions like `endExecute` where the balance check might consume more gas than expected.
