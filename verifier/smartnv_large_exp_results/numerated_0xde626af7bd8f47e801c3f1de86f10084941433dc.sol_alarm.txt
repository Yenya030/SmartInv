The contract to analyze is:

contract VotingSystem {
    uint256 public totalVotes;
    mapping(address => uint256) public userVotes;
    
    function vote() public {
        totalVotes++;
        userVotes[msg.sender]++;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
- ID uniqueness violation
- Inconsistent state update.
