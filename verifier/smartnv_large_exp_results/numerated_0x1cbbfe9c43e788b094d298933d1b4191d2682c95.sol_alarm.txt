The contract provided for analysis:

contract VotingSystem {
    mapping(uint => address) public voters;
    mapping(address => bool) public hasVoted;

    function vote(uint proposalId) external {
        require(voters[proposalId] == msg.sender, "You are not eligible to vote");
        require(!hasVoted[msg.sender], "You have already voted");
        
        // Update state
        hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    }
}

The potential vulnerabilities identified in the contract are:
4) inconsistent state update
7) ID uniqueness violation
