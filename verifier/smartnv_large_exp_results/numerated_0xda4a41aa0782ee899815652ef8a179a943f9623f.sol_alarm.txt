The contract provided for analysis:

contract Escrow {
    address public payer;
    address public payee;
    uint public amount;
    bool public paid;

    constructor(address _payer, address _payee, uint _amount) public {
        payer = _payer;
        payee = _payee;
        amount = _amount;
        paid = false;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == payer, "Only payer can deposit funds");
        require(msg.value == amount, "Incorrect amount sent");
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == payee, "Only payee can withdraw funds");
        require(paid == false, "Funds have already been withdrawn");
        payee.transfer(amount);
        paid = true;
    }
}

Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The deposit and withdraw functions are not restricted to only the involved parties (payer and payee). This could lead to unauthorized access to funds.
2) Inconsistent state update: The paid variable is simply toggled to true after a payee withdraws the funds. This may lead to unexpected behaviors if multiple withdrawals are attempted.
