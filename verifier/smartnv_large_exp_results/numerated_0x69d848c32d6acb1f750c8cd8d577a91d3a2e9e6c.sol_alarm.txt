Potential vulnerabilities in the given contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The contract does not update the state of 'proposal' struct after starting a new proposal in the 'startExecute' function. This can lead to issues with tracking the current proposal state accurately.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'owner' variable is declared as internal, which might not be the intended visibility level for this variable. This could potentially lead to ownership control issues.
3) Insufficient gas: There is a lack of explicit gas management in the contract functions, which could result in transactions failing due to running out of gas.
4) Integer overflow/underflow: The calculations in functions like 'execute' and 'endExecute' involve addition of amounts without any overflow/underflow checks, which could lead to arithmetic overflow vulnerabilities.
