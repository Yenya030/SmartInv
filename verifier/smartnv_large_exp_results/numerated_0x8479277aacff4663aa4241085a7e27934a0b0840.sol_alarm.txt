The contract you provided contains potential vulnerabilities: 
3) business logic flaw: The 'endExecute' function checks if the balance of the contract is greater than twice the total supply, which may not be a valid condition for successful execution.
11) suicidal contracts: The contract does not have a self-destruct function but may still have design flaws that could potentially lead to a suicide attack.
14) incorrect visibility/ownership: The 'proposal' struct is not initialized with proper access control modifiers, which may lead to unauthorized access or manipulation.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are: business logic flaw, suicidal contracts, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
