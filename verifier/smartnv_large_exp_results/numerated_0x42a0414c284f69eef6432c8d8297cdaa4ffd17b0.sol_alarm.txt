The contract to analyze:

contract Auction {
         address public highestBidder;
         uint public highestBid;

         function bid() public payable {
             require(msg.value > highestBid, "Bid is lower than current highest bid");
             highestBidder.transfer(highestBid);
             highestBidder = msg.sender;
             highestBid = msg.value;
         }
     }

Output: potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
- integer overflow/underflow: vulnerability present in the bid() function, where checking for msg.value > highestBid may result in integer overflow if msg.value is larger than the maximum value that can be stored in uint.
