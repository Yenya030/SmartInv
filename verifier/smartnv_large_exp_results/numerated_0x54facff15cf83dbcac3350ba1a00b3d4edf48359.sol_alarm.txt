potential vulnerabilities in the contract:
1) Inconsistent state update: The function endExecute() updates the state variable lockedFunds based on the balance of the contract at the end of execution. This may lead to inconsistent state updates as the balance of the contract can change due to external transactions.
2) Atomicity violation: The execute() function involves multiple state changes like transferring tokens and updating votedAmount without proper atomicity checks, which can lead to inconsistent state if any of these operations fail midway.
3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract implements the IERC20 interface but does not provide the necessary functions for ERC20 token functionality, potentially leading to incorrect visibility and ownership issues.
