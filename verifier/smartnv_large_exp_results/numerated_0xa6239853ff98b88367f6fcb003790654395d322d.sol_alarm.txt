The contract contains the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The execute function updates the state of the proposal by increasing the votedAmount without taking measures to ensure that the operation is atomic, which could lead to inconsistent or unexpected results if multiple transactions try to update the state concurrently.

2) Insufficient gas: The endExecute function performs a calculation that involves checking the balance of the contract, which could potentially consume a large amount of gas if the contract holds a significant amount of funds. This may result in the transaction running out of gas and failing.

3) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of variables like lockedFunds, proposal, startingBalanceList, and owner is not specified, which could lead to unintended access or manipulation of these variables by external or unauthorized parties.

Therefore, the potential vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update, insufficient gas, and incorrect visibility/ownership.
