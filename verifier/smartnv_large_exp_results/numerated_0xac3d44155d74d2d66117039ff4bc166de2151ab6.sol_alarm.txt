The contract provided for analysis:

contract Escrow {
     address public seller;
     address public buyer;
     address public arbiter;
     uint public value;
     enum State {AWAITING_PAYMENT, AWAITING_DELIVERY, COMPLETE, REFUNDED}
     State public state;
     
     constructor(address _seller, address _buyer, address _arbiter, uint _value) public {
         seller = _seller;
         buyer = _buyer;
         arbiter = _arbiter;
         value = _value;
         state = State.AWAITING_PAYMENT;
     }
     
     function confirmPayment() public {
         require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can confirm payment");
         require(address(this).balance >= value, "Insufficient balance");
         state = State.AWAITING_DELIVERY;
     }
     function confirmDelivery() public {
         require(msg.sender == buyer || msg.sender == seller, "Only buyer or seller can confirm delivery");
         state = State.COMPLETE;
         payable(seller).transfer(value);
     }
     function refund() public {
         require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Only arbiter can refund");
         state = State.REFUNDED;
         payable(buyer).transfer(value);
     }

}

Output:
- Incorrect visibility/ownership: The functions confirmPayment(), confirmDelivery(), and refund() do not have proper access control and can be called by unintended parties, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
- Inconsistent state update: The state transitions in the contract may not be clear and can lead to unexpected conditions between states, possibly resulting in incorrect contract behavior or allowing for exploitation.
- Ether leakage: The contract transfers Ether without proper checks and conditions, which can lead to Ether leakage or funds being directed to unintended recipients.
- Reentrancy: The functions confirmDelivery() and refund() perform Ether transfers before updating the state, which can potentially allow for reentrancy attacks if the recipient contract calls back into the Escrow contract during the transfer process.
