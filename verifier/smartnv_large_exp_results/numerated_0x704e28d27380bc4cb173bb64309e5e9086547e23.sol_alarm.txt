Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) Integer overflow: The contract does not have proper checks and handling for potential integer overflow/underflow issues, especially in functions like calculatePrice() where arithmetic operations are involved.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not explicitly define the visibility of functions and variables, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
3) Privilege escalation: There might be a privilege escalation vulnerability depending on the access control mechanisms and permissions within the contract.
4) Ether leakage: The contract does not handle ether payments or transfers securely, potentially leading to ether leakage vulnerabilities.
