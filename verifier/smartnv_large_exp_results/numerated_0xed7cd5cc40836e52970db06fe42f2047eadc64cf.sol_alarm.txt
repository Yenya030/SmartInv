The contract you provided is susceptible to the following potential vulnerabilities:

1) Inconsistent state update: The variable `lockedFunds` in the `endExecute` function is updated without proper synchronization, which could result in inconsistent state updates.

2) Insufficient gas: There is a potential for running out of gas in the `endExecute` function due to the loop over `votingToken.balanceOf(address(this))`, which could lead to the function failing.

Therefore, the identified vulnerabilities in the contract are inconsistent state update and insufficient gas.
