The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:
1) Incorrect visibility/ownership vulnerability in the withdraw function: The withdraw function allows anyone to call it, leading to unauthorized withdrawal of funds.
2) Integer overflow/underflow vulnerability in the buyTokens function: There is no check for integer overflow when updating the totalSupply and balanceOf mapping, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the values exceed the maximum limit for uint256.
