Potential vulnerabilities in the contract:

1) inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without proper synchronization or checks, potentially leading to inconsistent state updates.

2) insufficient gas: The contract may run out of gas when checking if the execution of a proposal has ended in the "execute" function due to the lack of gas optimization.

3) incorrect visibility/ownership: The contract does not specify the access level (e.g., public, internal, external) for the "Proposal" struct and other variables, which could lead to incorrect accessibility and ownership control.
