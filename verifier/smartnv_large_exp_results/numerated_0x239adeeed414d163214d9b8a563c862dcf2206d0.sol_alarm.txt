The potential vulnerabilities in contract XYZ are:

6) Cross bridge inconsistency: The contract allows for the transfer of tokens without explicitly checking for any potential inconsistencies or ensuring atomicity.
8) Reentrancy: The withdraw function allows for a potential reentrancy attack where an attacker can repeatedly withdraw funds before the balance is updated.
14) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The visibility of the balance mapping is not specified, potentially allowing unauthorized access or manipulation.
13) Insufficient gas: The contract does not consider gas requirements for certain functions, which may lead to out-of-gas errors during execution.
9) Integer overflow/underflow: The contract does not implement any checks for integer overflow or underflow when handling balances, which could result in unexpected behavior.
