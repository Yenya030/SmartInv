The potential vulnerabilities in the contract are:

1) Inconsistent state update: The "lockedFunds" variable is updated in the "endExecute" function without any proper synchronization or locking mechanism, which could lead to inconsistent state updates.
2) Incorrect visibility/ownership: The "owner" variable is marked as internal but is not used anywhere in the contract, which could indicate incorrect ownership settings.
