The invariants associated with the smart contract after <code> are as follows:

7+ 
assert(m_numOwners > 0);

16+
require(ownerIndex != 0);

19+
require(pending.yetNeeded >= 0);

24+
assert(pending.yetNeeded >= 0);

25+
assert(pending.yetNeeded > 1);

30+
require((pending.ownersDone & ownerIndexBit) == 0);
