The invariants associated with the smart contract after <code> are as follows:

8+ assert(WETH != address(0) && USDC != address(0), "Tokens cannot be zero address");

14+ require(id != 0, "ID cannot be 0");

18+ require(debt >= 0, "Debt must be greater than or equal to 0");

28+ require(debt >= 0 && back >= 0 && maxReturn >= 0, "Debt, back, and maxReturn must be greater than or equal to 0");

30+ assert(debt >= 0, "Debt must be greater than or equal to 0");
