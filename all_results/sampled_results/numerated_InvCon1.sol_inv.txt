The smart contract provided does not contain any invariants associated with the number line. Invariants are typically used to ensure certain conditions are always true within the smart contract code. If you could provide more context or specific requirements regarding the number line and where invariants should be inserted, I would be able to help generate the appropriate invariants for you.
