The invariants associated with the smart contract after <code> are as follows:

8+ require(balance[from] >= fee + value, "Insufficient balance for transfer");
9+ require(balance[to] + value >= balance[to] && balance[msg.sender] + fee >= balance[msg.sender], "Balance overflow detected");
10+ require(balance[to] + value >= balance[to], "Balance overflow for 'to' address detected");
12+ require(balance[msg.sender] + fee >= balance[msg.sender], "Balance overflow for sender detected");

These invariants ensure that the transfer function does not lead to balance overflows and that there are sufficient balances for transfers to take place.
