a set of instructions written in a programming language that is used to tell a computer how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It is typically saved in a text file and can be edited using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). The source code is then compiled or interpreted by a computer to create executable code that can be run and executed.
