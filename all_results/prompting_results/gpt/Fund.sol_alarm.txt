a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be understood and executed by a computer. These instructions tell the computer what actions to take or what calculations to perform in order to complete a specific task or achieve a desired outcome. A programmer writes source code to create software applications, websites, or other types of computer programs. The source code is typically saved in text files and then compiled or interpreted by a programming tool to produce an executable program that can be run on a computer.
