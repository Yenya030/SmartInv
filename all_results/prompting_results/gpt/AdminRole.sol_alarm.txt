a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be understood by a computer. It is used to create software applications, websites, and other digital products. The source code serves as the blueprint for the program and contains the logic and algorithms that determine how the software operates. Developers write and edit source code using text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs). Once the source code is written, it is typically compiled or interpreted to create an executable file that can be run on a computer.
