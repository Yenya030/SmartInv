a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or function. This code is typically saved in a file with a specific file extension (such as .py for Python or .java for Java) and can be edited and run by a programmer using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). The computer uses a compiler or interpreter to translate the source code into machine code that it can understand and execute.
