a set of instructions written in a specific programming language that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or operation. These instructions are typically written by a programmer and can be executed by a computer to produce a desired output or result. Source code is typically saved in plain text files and is then compiled or interpreted by a software development tool to create an executable program that can be run on a computer.
