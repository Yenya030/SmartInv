a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be translated by a computer into executable code to perform a specific task or function. The source code is typically saved in a text file and is written by programmers to create software applications, websites, or other computer programs. It serves as the blueprint for the final product and can be edited and modified as needed during the development process.
