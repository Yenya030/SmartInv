a set of instructions written in a programming language that provide the logic for a computer program to execute. 

Source code is typically stored in text files and can be read and edited by programmers using code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs). This code is then compiled or interpreted by a computer to produce an executable program that can be run by end users.
