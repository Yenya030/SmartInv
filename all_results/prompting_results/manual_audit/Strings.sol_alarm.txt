a set of instructions written in a specific programming language that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It is often saved in a file with a specific file extension (e.g. .java, .py, .cpp) and can be edited using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). The source code is then compiled or interpreted by a software tool to create an executable program that can be run on a computer.
