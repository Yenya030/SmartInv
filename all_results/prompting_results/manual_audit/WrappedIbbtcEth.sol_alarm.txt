written instructions that tell a computer how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. This code is typically written in a programming language such as Java, Python, C++, or JavaScript, and is then compiled or interpreted by a computer to execute the desired actions. Good source code is well-organized, efficient, and easy to read and understand, making it easier for developers to maintain and modify the code in the future.
