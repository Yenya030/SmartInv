a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be understood by a computer to perform a specific task or achieve a desired outcome. It typically consists of a series of commands, statements, and functions that are executed in a specific order to produce a result. Source code can be written by programmers and software developers using text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs), and is typically saved in files with specific file extensions such as .py for Python, .java for Java, or .cpp for C++.
