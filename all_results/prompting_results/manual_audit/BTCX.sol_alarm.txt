a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute to perform a specific task or function. This code serves as the foundation for software and applications, allowing developers to create complex programs by defining specific algorithms and operations. Each line of code is a command that tells the computer what to do, and when all the lines are compiled or interpreted, they form a complete program that can be run on a computer or device.
