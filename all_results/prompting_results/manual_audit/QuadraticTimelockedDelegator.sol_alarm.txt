a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It is the foundation of computer programs and applications, allowing developers to create software by specifying how it should behave and function. The source code is typically created by software developers using integrated development environments (IDEs) and is then compiled or interpreted to create executable code that can be run on a computer.
