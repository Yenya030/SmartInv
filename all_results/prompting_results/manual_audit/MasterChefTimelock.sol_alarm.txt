a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It typically consists of a series of commands, functions, and variables that tell the computer how to perform a specific task or solve a problem. Source code is usually saved in text files with specific file extensions (such as .py for Python, .js for JavaScript, or .java for Java) and needs to be compiled or interpreted before it can be run by the computer.
