a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be understood and executed by a computer. It is used to create software, applications, and websites. Programmers write source code to tell the computer what to do and how to do it, often using specific syntax and rules for the chosen programming language. The source code is then compiled or interpreted to generate machine code that can be executed by a computer.
