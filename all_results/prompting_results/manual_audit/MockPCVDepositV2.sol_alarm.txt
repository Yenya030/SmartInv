a set of instructions written in a programming language that tell a computer how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. The source code is typically created by a programmer and can be edited and modified to achieve different results. It is then compiled or interpreted by a compiler or interpreter to convert it into machine code that the computer can understand and execute.
