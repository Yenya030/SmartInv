a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task or function. It is the backbone of software development and allows developers to create applications and programs that can be used by end-users. Source code is typically written using text editors or integrated development environments and is then compiled or interpreted to produce executable code that can be run on a computer.
