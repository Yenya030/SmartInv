a set of instructions written in a programming language that is used to create software applications or programs. It is a series of commands or statements that tell a computer how to perform a specific task or function. Developers write and edit source code using a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and then compile or interpret it to create executable machine code that can be run by a computer.
