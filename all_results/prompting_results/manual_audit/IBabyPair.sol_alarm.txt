a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be executed by a computer. It typically consists of lines of text that describe actions to be taken by the computer, such as calculations, data manipulation, or interaction with external systems. The source code is then compiled or interpreted by a software development tool to create an executable program that can be run on a computer or other device.
