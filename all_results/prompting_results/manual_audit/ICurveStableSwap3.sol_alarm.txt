a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute. It typically includes variables, functions, and other elements that define how a program should function. Source code is usually saved in text files with a specific file extension, such as .js for JavaScript or .py for Python. Developers write and edit source code using text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) before compiling or interpreting it to create an executable program.
