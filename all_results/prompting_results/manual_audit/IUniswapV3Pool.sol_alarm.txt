a set of instructions and commands written in a programming language that can be executed by a computer or software program. It contains the logic and functionality needed to perform specific tasks or operations. 

Here is an example of source code written in JavaScript that creates a simple "Hello, world!" program:

```javascript
// This is a comment
// It is ignored by the computer and is used for adding notes or explanations in the code

// Define a variable called message and assign it the value "Hello, world!"
var message = "Hello, world!";

// Display the message in the console
console.log(message);
```

This code sets a variable `message` to the string "Hello, world!" and then logs that message to the console. When executed, this code will output "Hello, world!" to the console.
