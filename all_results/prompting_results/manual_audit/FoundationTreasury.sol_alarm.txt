a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or accomplish a particular goal. It is typically created by a software developer or programmer and is often saved in files with extensions like .py for Python, .java for Java, or .cpp for C++. When the source code is run through a compiler or interpreter, it is translated into machine code that the computer can execute.
