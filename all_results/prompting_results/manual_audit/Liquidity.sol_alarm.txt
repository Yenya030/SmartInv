A set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It is typically saved in a text file with a specific file extension (such as .c for C programming language or .py for Python). Source code is then compiled or interpreted by a software program to produce an executable program that can be run on a computer.
