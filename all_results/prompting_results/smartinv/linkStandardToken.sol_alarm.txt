a set of instructions and commands written in a programming language that is used to create software programs and applications. It defines how a program will function and operate, including the logic and algorithms that drive the program's behavior. The source code is typically written by a software developer and then compiled or interpreted to create an executable program that can be run on a computer or other hardware device.
